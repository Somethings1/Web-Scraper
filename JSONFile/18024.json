That\u2019s to say, its likely to perform relatively better in times of risk-on and relatively worse in times of risk-off.","But its also likely due to the pricing out of optimism that spot Ethereum ETFs will soon gain approval.","There won't be an #Ethereum ETF this month.","It is likely to be a delay or extension of 60 days, during which July\/August will be the big moment for the markets.","In terms of expectations?","The markets are bottoming in the next 1-2 weeks and rotate back up from that news.","\u2014 Micha√´l van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 9, 2024","","The SEC is widely expected to reject these ETF applications this month as it probes crypto firms for evidence that Ethereum might be a security.","However, given these rejections are now widely expected, this is unlikely to have much market impact.","","While whale activity has some hoping the Ethereum price could soon rebound, technical analysis suggests the outlook remains fragile.","The Ethereum price remains locked within a downward trend channel that has been in play since March.","It has also broken to its 50 and 100DMAs. A recovery to the $3,200 area is plausible, but this is a very strong area of resistance.","With the next leg of the crypto market rally unlikely to take hold anytime soon, Ether could continue to struggle.","A test of support at $2,700 in the coming weeks is very plausible, especially if Bitcoin dips back under $60,000.","This is roughly in line with where the 200DMA resides and so should be a strong zone of support.","","The recent Dencun upgrade has reduced Ethereum fees by as much as 4x, according to CryptoQuant data.","#Ether turns inflationary for the first time since Merge :\nThis marks the first period of #Ethereum becoming inflationary in the past year and a half since the Merge took place.","Total Ether supply increased to 120.1 million on May 7, from 120 million on March 12, before the\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/qxeIxPl1X4","\u2014 TOBTC (@_TOBTC) May 9, 2024","","That has substantially reduced the cryptocurrency\u2019s burn rate, with the Ether supply recently turning inflationary as a result.","This has concerned some ETH traders.
