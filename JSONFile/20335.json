Another 22% estimate that this might happen next year, and also 22% said USDC could overtake USDT in 2024. ","Dimitrios Salampasis, a featured expert and  Director of Tech Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Swinburne University of Technology, said he believed \u201CUSDC is safer, more transparent and more compliant towards governmental regulations. Moreover, USDC has more transparency in relation to its reserves. I still have not seen a full and proper audit from USDT.\u201D","﻿At the same time, in the aftermath of the Terra meltdown and collapse of its terraUSD stablecoin and native token LUNA (now \u2013 LUNC), the absolute majority of the respondents indicated that attempts to restart the network do not have a future ahead of them. ","A mere 2% of Finder\u2019s panel estimates Terra\u2019s hard fork revival plan could be successful, and 80% declare it will fail. The respondents claim that LUNA, the native token of the new Terra network, will be worth USD 0.84 by the end of 2022, and its value will slide to USD 0.46 by 2030. At the time of writing, it trades at around USD 1.96.\n\n\u201CThe Luna brand will likely be damaged goods for the remainder of its existence (at least within the blockchain field). An algorithmic stablecoin based on trust is feasible, but it will most certainly not be hosted on a blockchain called Luna,\u201D Daniel Polotsky, Founder and Chairman of crypto ATM chain CoinFlip, was quoted as saying.\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Circle Denies USDC Trouble Rumors, Tether Supply Still Elevated on Curve\n\u2013 Tron is Eating into Ethereum\u2019s Share of the Tether Market, But It Will Have to Do More to Become a Serious Rival\n\n\u2013 Tether is Fully Backed, Has \u2018Never Failed a Redemption,\u2019 CTO Tells Short Sellers\n\u2013 Stablecoin Active Addresses Hit New High After Terra Collapse While Bitcoin and Ethereum Addresses Drop\n\n\u2013 Here\u2019s the \u2018Final Guidance\u2019 on \u2018Stablecoin Arrangements\u2019 by BIS and IOSCO\n\u2013 Do Kwon Says He\u2019s No Fraudster and Has \u2018Great Confidence\u2019 in Terra 2.0"],"entity":[{"type":"USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Terra Collapse While Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tech Innovation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u2013 Circle Denies USDC Trouble Rumors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"IOSCO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"78%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"22%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra 2.0","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"LUNA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Swinburne University of Technology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Daniel Polotsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Terra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2030","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CTO","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Competition","Forecast","Stablecoin","Survey","Tether","USDC","USDT"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
