However, one can differentiate the forged from the authentic by checking its package name, the version, or the MD5 message-digest algorithm.","For example, the official app\u2019 package name is cn.gov.pbc.dcep, while the \u201CTest Version\u201D excludes the governmental elements and presents as com.ecny.ecny2.","With the logo, UI, and slogans comparable to the original, the fake apps often resemble pyramid schemes and claim to offer \u201Cdividends\u201D for the users that share the software. The scammers misused the e-CNY promotions and simulated \u201Cnational welfare\u201D distributions.","After users are lured to download the forged apps, they would be required to fill out detailed personal information for the \u201Celigibility verification,\u201D creating a false sense of legal compliance.","The apps may even ask if the users have previously participated in similar programs and received funds in digital yuan, intentionally extending the waiting period to bait the trap.","Eventually, the fake apps have customer service pages set up for the users while they may find no deposits in their wallets or fail to withdraw the \u201Cfunds\u201D sent by the scammers.","To resolve the \u201Ctechnical issue,\u201D the users must download messaging apps other than the commonly used ones and fall into the quagmire. The \u201Ccustomer service\u201D would end up asking for money instead of giving out the \u201Cwelfare.\u201D","Though users can avoid such scams by only downloading apps from the verified platforms, criminal activities still increased as popularity of China\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC) grew.","In January, the Yangpu District People\u2019s Court of Shanghai issued the verdict for the first instance of money laundering using digital yuan and cryptocurrency. In the meantime, China is looking to deploy more real-world e-CNY applications."],"entity":[{"type":"the Yangpu District People\u2019s Court of Shanghai","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","China","Digital Yuan"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
