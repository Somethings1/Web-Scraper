However, the final purchase price of a lot, which includes the hammer price with the buyer\u2019s premium, or the price realized, hit USD 69.35m.","Just two hours before the end of the auction, there were 165 bids, and the highest bid was USD 13.25m. And then, the real race started:","Bidding opened at USD 100 and hit USD 1m on the first day.","___","___","The auction house has enabled payment in ethereum (ETH) for this piece, stating that the payment must be made from a wallet maintained with Coinbase, Coinbase Custody Trust, Fidelity Digital Assets Services, Gemini Trust Company, or Paxos Trust Company.","Per the auction website, this unique NFT was minted on February 16, 2021. The lot essay states that in May 2007 Beeple decided to start creating and posting a new work of art online every day, thus creating a new digital picture every day for 5,000 days straight until January this year \u2013 showing the artist\u2019s evolution over time.","\u201CIndividually known as EVERYDAYS, collectively, the pieces form the core of EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS,\u201D it says. In it \u201Cthe artist has stitched together recurring themes and color schemes to create an aesthetic whole. Organized in loose chronological order, zooming in on individual pieces reveals abstract, fantastical, grotesque, and absurd pictures, alongside current events and deeply personal moments.\u201D","In recent years, Beeple often reacted to political events. \u201CI almost look at it now like I\u2019m a political cartoonist,\u201D he said. \u201CExcept instead of doing sketches, I\u2019m using the most advanced 3D tools to make comments on current events, almost in real-time.\u201D","The South Carolina-based artist collaborated with major brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Apple, Space X, and Nike, as well as performing artists such as Imagine Dragons, Ariana Grande, Childish Gambino, and Katy Perry.","\u201CWe must recognize the record-breaking sale of Beeple\u2019s opus as what it is: a watershed moment for our industry. This sale will allow the public to see the capabilities of NFTs in the art space, however, it is just the beginning of the NFT revolution, which will ultimately change the way we live,\u201D Justin Banon, CEO and Co-founder of Boson Protocol, the developer of a \u201Ccapture resistant dCommerce ecosystem\u201D using NFTs encoded with game theory, said in an emailed comment.","According to him, NFTs are fueling the rise of decentralized commerce and remove the need for arbitration in the fulfillment of digital to physical redemption.","Meanwhile, Nifty Gateway shows Beeple\u2019s artwork sold out in December, two of which went to their new owner \u2018pablo\u2019 for USD 66,666.66 each. \u201CCrossroad,\u201D for example, is a token that changed based on the outcome of the US election. Many of the pieces have been resold for higher prices, earning the artist his share of the pie with each sale as well. For example, as reported, the Trump-themed work named \u201CCrossroad\u201D was resold on the secondary market for USD 6.6m.","\u201CThat was a real wake-up call for all of us [\u2026] to see such significant sums being paid,\u201D Christie\u2019s Noah Davis is quoted as saying by the New York Times.","Davis is also quoted by The Art Newspaper as saying that this auction and accepting payment in ETH are \u201Cthe perfect opportunity to explore cryptocurrency because we have the perfect seller who is happy to receive payment in ETH.\u201D","As reported in October last year, a bitcoin (BTC)-themed work named Block 21 fetched USD 131,250 at a Christie\u2019s auction \u2013 seven times above their estimate.
