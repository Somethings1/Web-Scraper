The next halving is in 2 days, and it will see rewards cut to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, essentially halving the rate of new supply.","This creates artificial scarcity, which increases demand, and has historically preceded massive multi-month BTC rallies \u2013 something the cryptocurrency community believes will be repeated.","This is something Goldman Sachs acknowledges, stating \u201CHistorically, the previous three halvings have been accompanied by BTC price appreciation after the halving, although the time it took to reach the all-time highs differs significantly.\u201D","","However, this time they are skeptical, warning their clients that \u201CCaution should be taken against extrapolating the past cycles and the impact of halving, given the respective prevailing macro conditions\u201D in a note from the Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities team on April 14th.","This doubt is seeded in the understanding that today\u2019s economy is not the same as it has been in previous halvings. Macroeconomic factors such as high inflation and interest rates should be taken into account.","Last year, the M2 money supply of the major central banks at the time, including the People\u2019s Bank of China, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the U.S. Federal Reserve, rose quickly.","Consequently, interest rates in the developed world remained at or below zero, encouraging risk-taking across the financial market, including cryptocurrencies. Goldman believes that similar macro conditions to encourage risk-taking are necessary for history to repeat itself in this cycle. ","That is not the case in today\u2019s world, with Interest rates in the US, the world\u2019s largest economy, standing above 5%, and the hopes of interest rate cuts fading. Traders estimate the probability of a June rate decrease at only 20.6%, compared to 45.9% for September, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool. ","This bearish outlook is shared with others, such as Bitwise, heeding similar warnings.","Historically, the Halving Has Been Good for Bitcoin\u2019s Price Long-Term (a Look at the Data)","The change in bitcoin\u2019s price in the year following the halving:","2012: 8,839%\n2016: 285%\n2020: 548%","The change in bitcoin\u2019s price in the month following the halving:","2012: 9%\n2016: -10%\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/aaXSakLfko","\u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) April 16, 2024","","Goldman maintains optimism despite the fact that the economy is not set up to sustain growth in the cryptocurrency space, arguing that the halving is only a \u201Cpsychological reminder to investors of BTC\u2019s capped supply.\u201D Instead, the medium-term outlook will be determined by the adoption of Bitcoin ETFs.","\u201CBTC price performance will likely continue to be driven by the said supply-demand dynamic and continued demand for BTC ETFs, which combined with the self-reflexive nature of crypto markets is the primary determinant for spot price action,\u201D the team stated.","In the last six months, US-based Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds have increased 130%. The 11 spot-based ETFs that went live three months ago have $59.2 billion in assets under management, according to Bloomberg.","Because of this, some analysts think that the majority of the typical post-halving surge has already occurred, which could lead to a \u201Cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201D pullback following the halving on April 20, according to Goldman.","The slowing growth in Bitcoin ETFs supports this. Although they have seen over $12 Billion in inflows since the SEC greenlighting spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, the majority of this inflow occurred last quarter. However, they have lost momentum as of April.","","Something caused by the \u201Cinitial novelty hype, ETF flows tend to run out unless prices continue increasing\u2014which they have not done since early March,\u201D commented 10x Research Founder Markus Thielen."],"entity":[{"type":"$59.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitwise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"8,839%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"45.9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"548%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Markus Thielen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$12 Billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Data)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin\u2019s Price Long","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"People\u2019s Bank of China","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last six months","content":"DATE"},{"type":"130%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"285%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"European Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"20.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"last quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CME","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bank of Japan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 14th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"-10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 16, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goldman","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Equities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Bitcoin halving","Goldman Sachs"],"authors":["Harvey Hunter"]}
