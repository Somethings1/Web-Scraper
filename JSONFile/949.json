Thus, the firm wanted to offer all of these services in one vehicle.","\"We believe that when staking is made easy for a larger pool of capital, the levels of participation will grow significantly,\" said Ogilvie. Staked is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/88762\/ethereum-2-proof-of-stake-power-concenration\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">one of the largest validators <\/a>of ETH.&nbsp;","The sponsor of the Staked ETH trust is Staked Capital, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Staked Securely. The custodian of the product is Fireblocks, and Staked Cayman Ltd provides staking services.","The product has an expense ratio of 1% and is open only by private placement to accredited investors. The minimum investment amount is $25,000, and investors face a 12-month lock-up period.","Like most crypto trust products in the market today, Staked ETH trust doesn't have a redemption mechanism in place. But Ogilvie told The Block that Staked will look to enable liquidity for the product by listing the trust's shares on over-the-counter markets.","Staked had been working on the ETH trust for the last six months, Ogilvie told The Block, adding that now is a good time to launch it because ETH is going through a \"major evolution\" and there is broader institutional interest in crypto.","\"Ethereum Improvement Proposal (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/96316\/ethereum-mining-pools-divided-eip1559\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EIP)-1559<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/85771\/eth2-phase-0-roll-out-long-way-to-go\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">move to proof-of-stake<\/a> will materially change the ETH economic policy, and seem likely to lead to a declining overall supply of ETH,\" said Ogilvie. \"So investors that like the hard cap of 21 million bitcoin will really like the ultra-sound money ETH offers.\"","Looking ahead, Staked could also launch trust products for more proof-of-stake coins, Ogilvie told The Block, because that would be a \"natural fit.\"","© 2023 The Block.
