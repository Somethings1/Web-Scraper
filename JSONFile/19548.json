The 21DMA is also providing strong resistance. Last at $0.468, ADA is down over 10% from earlier weekly highs.","As the Cardano (ADA) price struggles to gain traction, investors are turning to a new virtual reality ICO called 5thScape (5SCAPE) to chase potential 2,300% profits.","The cryptocurrency is down more than 40% from its March highs, with most other altcoins also suffering as macro headwinds have picked up.","The latest US Core PCE inflation data emphasized that core price pressures in the US are still uncomfortably high, supportingÂ the notion that the Fed will wait until later in 2024 before cutting interest rates.","Here is Powells favourite inflation gauge.","PCE Core Service Less Housing MoM up almost 0.6%","TOO much..

TVL refers to the value of crypto locked in smart contracts on a blockchain.","Cardano\u2019s TVL currently ranks 26th, suggesting the ADA price could be substantially overvalued.","After all, Cardano is the 10th largest crypto, with a market cap of $21.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.","To put Cardano\u2019s potential overvaluation into some context, its TVL is less than PulseChain, Ultron, MultiverseX, and Thorchain.","But its market cap valuation is at least 10x these rivals.","That\u2019s not to say that ADA will see a 90% price drop. It may struggle to keep pace with other major cryptos that enjoy much more adoption, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, however.","Same repetitive but useless slogan of Cardanzos: DYOR","I did.","50K active users daily max\n4.4M wallets\n350M TVL\n88M transactions\n200M liquidity in USDM\n\u2026 this is RIDICULOUS","Tell me something I don't know and that changes my mind.
