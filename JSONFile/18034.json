The United States\u2019 treatment of digital asset rewards is overly complex \u2013 leading to confusion by investors, double taxation, and American businesses relocating overseas,\u201D said Ferguson.","The proposed legislation aims to establish clear tax guidelines for block rewards from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks, aligning taxation with the sale or spending of these rewards rather than their acquisition.","I\u2019m proud to introduce the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act with @RepDrewFerguson to ensure clear guidance on the taxation of digital assets.","This is a critical step that will spur innovation, strengthen investor confidence & discourage business from moving overseas. https:\/\/t.co\/rDpvvEhIBI","\u2014 Rep.

Despite efforts by Representatives Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry, leaders in both the Senate and the House of Representatives are hesitant to merge stablecoin legislation with the FAA bill, which is considered a must-pass piece of legislation.","While combining the two bills would be unprecedented in financial services policy, lawmakers typically add less popular legislation to larger bills to garner bipartisan support.","The Digital Chamber\u2019s chief policy officer, Cody Carbone, expressed scepticism about the likelihood of stablecoin legislation passing before the U.S. presidential election, giving it only a 35% chance. Carbone highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding key issues such as regulatory oversight and state-level regulation, which have hindered the progress of stablecoin bills like Representative Patrick McHenry\u2019s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act. "],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FAA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gillibrand","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sheila Warren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 1, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Digital Chamber\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Council for Innovation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cody Carbone","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Patrick McHenry","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Federal Aviation Administration","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wiley Nickel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"IRS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ferguson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"House of Representatives","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Representatives Maxine Waters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"35%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 30, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulations","Staking","USA"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
