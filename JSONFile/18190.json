We of course hope that this will change going forward.\u201D","An offline mode for CBDCs would let people make transactions even without internet access, mimicking a key advantage of cash. The governor also reaffirmed that CBDC will offer anonymity similar to cash.","\u201CAnonymity can be addressed through legislation and\/or through technology. For example, through permanent deletion of transactions. That could be one method. The basic principle is that CBDC can have the same degree of anonymity as cash. No more and no less,\u201D he said.","Das also reassured the public that India\u2019s digital rupee was designed to not offer interest, unlike traditional bank deposits. This, he explained, safeguards banks\u2019 business models.","\u201CThis feature should mitigate any potential risk of bank disintermediation,\u201D he said.\nHe also said that the RBI is working on connecting fast-payment systems like UPI with the upcoming CBDC, respond to calls from retail users.","One step the bank is taking is allowing a single QR code to work for both UPI and CBDC payments, streamlining the acceptance process for businesses.","India is one of the few frontrunners in experimenting with a CBDC, while developed nations take a more cautious approach.","The country has been widening the use of its digital currency, the e-Rupee, through a pilot program launched in Dec. 2022. Over 1.3m customers and 300,000 merchants have participated so far.","By March 2023, over 16 crore rupees ($1.2m) were circulated. However, the majority (65%) is currently used in the wholesale segment, with retail adoption at 35%.","India\u2019s RBI is among the vast majority (98%) of central banks worldwide actively exploring CBDCs through research, pilot programs, or implementation. Their goal is to improve the functionality and accessibility of central bank money."],"entity":[{"type":"Shaktikanta Das","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"The Economic Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UPI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Reserve Bank of India (RBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dec. 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.2","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"65%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"98%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"35%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"India","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CBDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank Digital Currency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Das","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"RBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","India","Reserve Bank of India"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
