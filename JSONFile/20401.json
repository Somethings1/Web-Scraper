In total, the ETFs have absorbed $6 billion in BTC since their launch.","That includes flows surrounding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) \u2013 the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin fund which converted into an ETF in January. Though the company\u2019s high fee structure has triggered non-stop outflows from the fund in favor of cheaper competitors, yesterday\u2019s daily outflow reached a record low of just $22.4 million.","This comes less than a week after the European Central Bank dismissed Bitcoin as having no real value, and called its rally following ETF approvals a \u201Cdead cat bounce\u201D.","In the past 47 days, Grayscale has suffered $7.4 billion of outflows, while competing funds from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others have absorbed $13.4 billion. In total, ETFs now hold over 723,000 BTC, worth $41.2 billion at today\u2019s price.","$ARKB with best flow day ever, Fidelity and Franklin with their 2nd biggest days ever. $IBIT tho relatively underwhelming at 'only' $111. As a team tho they netted half a billion. This is like when Embiid has an off night but Maxey and Harris pop off in Sixers blowout win. https:\/\/t.co\/Rxe8FIFxEc","\u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 27, 2024","","Flows were impressive on Monday, as the nine newly launched Bitcoin ETFs \u2013 excluding Grayscale \u2013 experienced record daily volume totaling $2.4 billion, including $1.3 billion for BlackRock\u2019s ETF alone. The figure put IBIT into the top 11 ETFs by volume in the entire country.","While \u201Cflows\u201D refer to the amount of Bitcoin gained or lost by the fund, \u201Cvolume\u201D refers to the amount traded \u2013 whether it\u2019s being bought or sold.","\u201CNot totally sure reason besides price rally generating interest but it does seem like these things really see heightened action on first day after weekend,\u201D Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posted to X on the matter.","Inflows to Bitcoin ETFs are proving to be correlated with Bitcoin\u2019s price action. In January, Bitcoin dumped from $49,000 to $39,000 as Grayscale investors sold $500 million in BTC per day for several days in a row.","Likewise, the price rose back above $50,000 earlier this month as GBTC sales slowed down, and Bitcoin ETFs started absorbing ~$500 million per day in net flows.","Some analysts suspect that Bitcoin ETFs may ultimately hurt Coinbase\u2019s bottom line by overtaking the firm as the nation\u2019s most popular Bitcoin trading venue."],"entity":[{"type":"Maxey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$7.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$IBIT","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$50,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Harris","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Franklin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$41.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$22.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"European Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$520 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Eric Balchunas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$57,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"earlier this month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 27, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"past 47 days","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$39,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Embiid","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$500 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$6 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BitMEX Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$49,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$111","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$13.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin ETF","Grayscale"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
