The price increase was due to Helium\u2019s recent expansion into Mexico through a new partnership, highlighting the potential for continued growth of its network. Other compelling gainers were IOTA, rising 15% after announcing asset tokenization agreements, and MANTA, climbing 14.75% due to strong adoption.","For investors focused on early opportunities, the presales of Bitcoin Minetrix and Meme Kombat have captured attention as developing crypto projects ripe with potential.","Helium will collaborate with Telefónica to enhance connectivity through its DePIN hotspots in Mexico\u2019s major cities. This partnership is expected to bridge connectivity gaps and deliver advanced blockchain-powered solutions for secure data offload with the potential for a global reach.","New partnership alert🚨@NovaLabs_ is working with @Telefonica to launch Helium Mobile Hotspots in Mexico! 🙌","This will allow @Telefonica customers to connect to the @Helium Mobile Network seamlessly using their Movistar SIM cards, reducing infrastructure costs while expanding\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/3u3CgcEdXO","\u2014 Helium Mobile (@helium_mobile) January 24, 2024","","The market has responded positively to Helium\u2019s initiatives, with the HNT token witnessing a notable 17.34% price increase yesterday. Still, Helium is facing scaling challenges and must demonstrate the viability of its decentralized network, despite the potential of the Telefónica partnership.","While its attempt to democratize internet access through blockchain technology is a bold step, coverage consistency and data speed are areas for improvement.","IOTA\u2019s market performance has been buoyant, with prices surging 15% over the past two days following founder Dominik Schiener\u2019s reveal of major asset tokenization deals. The price reached $0.2529 earlier today, with further momentum expected.","The upcoming IOTA Ethereum Virtual Machine, slated for March 31, 2024, is set to enhance IOTA\u2019s ecosystem significantly. This advancement, coupled with the release of the new alpha platform version, underscores IOTA\u2019s dedication to improvement and broadening its capabilities.","Technical indicators point to a bullish trend for IOTA, with the current trade price at $0.2459, representing a 9.69% increase so far today. The price action suggests a possible breakout from a descending trendline, which could propel a bullish rally. Based on the technical setup, potential upside price targets could be around $0.32.","Meanwhile, Manta Network has marked its status as a capable layer-2 scaling solution, evidenced by its $1.58 billion Total Value Locked and over 745,000 user addresses. Transaction numbers exceeding 11 million further confirm Manta\u2019s rising trajectory.","The Pyth Network is excited to release its MANTA\/USD price feed$MANTA is the native token of the @MantaNetwork, the new Modular Layer-2","The Pyth MANTA\/USD price feed is now available on more than 50 blockchains, including on Manta powering @LayerBankFi and @zerolendxyz pic.twitter.com\/aNXJLx0ldl","\u2014 Pyth Network 🔮 (@PythNetwork) January 18, 2024","","Pyth Network\u2019s addition of the MANTA-USD price feed expands its trading accessibility across more than 50 blockchains, catering to a wider decentralized market. Manta Network\u2019s two layer-2 blockchains, Manta Pacific and Manta Atlantic, have saved users substantial gas fees.","Despite facing a DDoS attack and complexity in its staking program, Manta Network has shown resilience in the market.","For those investigating the best crypto to buy today, the presales of Bitcoin Minetrix and Meme Kombat should not be overlooked. These early-stage projects are also drawing attention for their potential impact on the broader cryptocurrency sector.","Investors monitoring the market for optimal purchases will find a mixed environment, with established cryptocurrencies like Helium, IOTA, and Manta Network progressing alongside new presales. Each project presents a unique set of advancements, market reactions, and dynamics, underscoring the importance of staying informed and adaptable.","Discerning investors focused on unearthing the best crypto to buy today and moving forward face an investment space constantly in motion, full of promise.","","","After posting a notable 17.34% gain yesterday, the HNT price has retreated 4.51% so far today to $6.656 amidst declining trading volumes. With HNT stabilizing above key support levels, technical indicators remain at a crossroads as investors determine whether this is a pullback within an uptrend or the beginning of a deeper correction.","The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) for the HNT price stands at $6.669, while the 50-day EMA sits at $6.083. With the faster 20-day EMA still above the 50-day EMA, this hints at an overall bullish trend for the HNT price. However, the narrow distance between these EMAs highlights increased volatility and uncertainty.","HNT\u2019s RSI currently registers at 50.60, down from yesterday\u2019s overbought reading of 53.68. This pullback towards the midpoint suggests waning upside momentum for the HNT price after its recent advance.","The MACD histogram is printing at -0.085, slightly improved from the previous day\u2019s -0.097 value. This indicates the short-term trend remains bearish, though sellers may be losing control.","With HNT stabilizing above the Fib 0.382 level of $6.739, bulls will look to recapture the psychological $7.00 level which aligns with resistance between $7.034 and $7.448. Beyond this area, the Fib 0.5 of $7.277 marks the next target.","On further declines, initial support rests at the 20-day EMA of $6.669 followed by the 50-day EMA and Fib 0.236 $6.083. A daily close below this area would strengthen the case for a deeper HNT price pullback towards the $5.00 handle.","Overall, the near-term outlook remains mixed for HNT following its recent advance. While holding above the 20-day EMA keeps short-term momentum intact, decreased trading volumes are a concern.","Breaking out above $7.00 resistance or breaking down through $6.00 support will likely set the next major trend.","","","IOTA buyers have stepped in decisively for the past two days, propelling the price 15% higher to $0.2400. With IOTA now attacking key moving averages and resistance, technical indicators are reflecting strengthening bullish momentum.","The 20-day EMA for the IOTA price stands at $0.2393 while the 50-day EMA resides at $0.2473. With the price rising to test these levels, a decisive move above could signal a bullish trend change. The 100-day EMA sits slightly lower at $0.2331, also representing a target for the bulls.","The RSI has surged to 48.35 today, up sharply from yesterday\u2019s oversold reading of 39.06. This rapid ascent reflects strengthening upside momentum that could propel the IOTA price through overhead resistance.","The MACD histogram has ticked up to -0.0007, a marked improvement from the previous day\u2019s -0.0028 level. IOTA bulls will now be looking for a bullish crossover of the MACD above zero to confirm the emerging uptrend.","Initial resistance for IOTA is expected between $0.2279 and $0.2349 where sellers have emerged. Clearing this area would open the path for a test of the 20-day EMA at $0.2393 and the 50-day EMA at $0.2473. Beyond this zone lies the psychological $0.25 level.","On pullbacks, the first major support level lies around $0.2100, which represents the confluence of the Fib 0.786 retracement level and IOTA\u2019s current swing low. If this area fails to hold, the 200-day EMA at $0.2161 would become the next downside target.","The technical outlook is improving for IOTA following its recent rally. With the RSI and MACD signaling strengthening upside momentum, penetration of the EMA resistance and $0.25 level could catalyze an accelerated move higher. Remaining above $0.21 support will be key for sustaining the newfound bullish bias.","","The MANTA price is taking a breather after hitting a new all-time high of $3.33 earlier today. Despite pulling back 4.10%, MANTA remains supported around the Fib 0.236 level at $3.06412, keeping the uptrend intact for now.","The hourly 20 EMA at $3.06144 and the 50 EMA at $2.92883 continue trending up, reflecting the bullish momentum. The 100 EMA at $2.74766 is also rising but at a slower pace, signaling potential consolidation following the sharp surge.","With the RSI at 56.16, MANTA has room to continue rallying once it gathers more upside energy. This indicates the path of least resistance remains higher for MANTA while Fib 0.236 support around $3.06 holds steady.","Looking ahead, the next major resistance zone for MANTA sits between $3.26257 and $3.33079 where the all-time high currently resides. A decisive break above this area would resume the uptrend.","On the downside, the critical Fib 0.236 support at $3.06412 remains key. As long as MANTA trades above this level, the bullish trend stays intact. A breakdown below $3.06 support could lead to a deeper correction towards the hourly 20 EMA near $3.06.","For now, MANTA remains in an uptrend while taking a breather above key Fib support. The bulls stay in control as long as $3.06 holds. A breakout above the $3.33 resistance is needed to confirm the next leg higher in MANTA.","As interest shifts to the next crypto breakout, Bitcoin Minetrix, and Meme Kombat are seizing the presale stage with novel concepts and mechanisms hoping to make a splash.","While has Bitcoin pioneered the cryptocurrency disruption of traditional finance, focusing solely on Bitcoin overlooks other up-and-coming cryptocurrencies progressively gaining traction.
