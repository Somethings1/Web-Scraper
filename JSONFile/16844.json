This was barely a discussion a few years ago, when a \u201Cwallet\u201D almost always described a piece of local software or hardware that held the cryptographic private keys that control assets on a blockchain (that, or old-fashioned folding leather).","But that clarity has been eroded, largely thanks to rising regulatory pressure. Declarations from bodies like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have introduced terms like \u201Cunhosted wallet\u201D and \u201Cnon-custodial wallet\u201D to distinguish user-controlled tools from \u201Ccustodial wallets\u201D \u2013 exchange accounts or other third-party services that hold crypto on users\u2019 behalf.","Critics, however, argue that many of these novel, regulator-championed terms are misleading. The issue has been occasionally debated in the industry, but bubbled to the surface with new intensity in recent weeks thanks in part to the resurrection of a U.S. \u201Cunhosted wallet rule\u201D first proposed late in the Trump administration. Broadly, the rule would require centralized exchanges to gather information about the users of software wallets before crypto can be sent to them from the exchange.","That\u2019s just one example of a larger regulatory push to erode the intended usability of crypto systems. It\u2019s closely tied, for instance, to attempts to expand the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) \u201Ctravel rule\u201D to cover crypto transactions \u2013 a measure already adopted in Switzerland.","What you call a crypto wallet may seem trivial in the face of such government attacks. But it has huge stakes for shaping perception of cryptocurrencies \u2013 and, in turn, regulation. Some terms for conventional software wallets, such as \u201Cunhosted wallet,\u201D are misleading, confusing or have vaguely negative connotations. Others, like \u201Cuser-controlled wallet,\u201D draw much clearer attention to the core advantages of cryptocurrencies.","Below, I\u2019ve assembled a list of seven different terms for a standard cryptocurrency wallet. Drawing on comments from an array of industry luminaries, I\u2019ve unpacked what each term is really saying \u2013 and whether that implicit message benefits or harms public perception of crypto.","Finally, note that the decentralization of wallets isn\u2019t entirely binary. Many standard software wallets rely on some sort of third-party infrastructure, and some crypto advocates argue the only way to truly self-custody is to run a node yourself. Those nuances aren\u2019t central to the regulatory debate (at least not yet), so they won\u2019t be addressed below.","Here, then, are your candidates.","Terrible, at least from an industry perspective. All this tells me is what it\u2019s not: setting up a binary that implicitly suggests that a \u201Chosted wallet\u201D is somehow better. It is also arguably deeply deceptive. Some commentators have even argued there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201Chosted wallet.\u201D Your crypto at an exchange like Coinbase is associated with an account that usually does not connect to an individual on-chain wallet at all. That\u2019s one reason it\u2019s sometimes difficult or costly to send crypto from an exchange account, and for the saying \u201Cnot your keys, not your crypto.\u201D","Your exchange account balances instead reflect an internal balance sheet maintained solely by the exchange, partly to avoid paying on-chain transaction fees. The actual funds are more or less just in one big pool managed by the exchange. This arrangement goes a long way toward explaining the prevalence of exchange hacks because huge blocks of crypto can be snagged by compromising just one or two big exchange-controlled wallets.","Much better!","This one\u2019s good because it emphasizes user power and responsibility. This suggestion came in second in an entirely informal and unscientific poll I conducted on Twitter.","If you want to nitpick, you might argue \u201Chosting\u201D isn\u2019t really the right term for what a wallet does. While a software or hardware wallet does store your keys, it otherwise doesn\u2019t store data or make it publicly available, as when a server \u201Chosts\u201D a website.","Similar to \u201Cself-hosted\u201D but more precise.","\u201CAny wallet that enables a user to custody their own keys and is trust-minimized should be classified as \u2019self-custody\u2019,\u201D argues Gregory Rocco, co-founder of Spruce Systems, \u201Cwhereas exchange wallets should be \u2018exchange-controlled.\u2019 It has the right level of detail \u2026 I wouldn't call my bank account with Chase self-custodied, [and that\u2019s] how we should treat exchange wallets.\u201D","The team at Spruce spends a lot of time thinking about wallets and self-custody: It is developing the Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE) standard, which aims to use wallets such as MetaMask to replace centralized identity services like Google.","Though surprisingly widely used, this one\u2019s just confusing because it can be read in two different senses. It\u2019s meant to spell out that a standard crypto wallet doesn\u2019t involve a custodian because a custodian is specifically a third party that protects an asset for you. But, as written, it could be easily misunderstood as suggesting users themselves don\u2019t have custody of their crypto in this kind of wallet, which is exactly the opposite of the case.","In effect, then, this is a phrase that obfuscates the difference between an exchange account and a standard wallet. Using this phrase in public communications is, intentionally or not, undermining self-custody as an important element of crypto culture.","These were the top vote-getters in my Twitter poll. They have the major advantage of being specific and descriptive without implying a value judgment (though see below on that). Relatively few people, I think, would mistake an exchange account accessed through a web browser for a piece of software or hardware.","These terms also help cast regulatory efforts in a clearer light. The policies regulators are pushing for could result in mandatory surveillance features for all possible versions of a piece of software, which Americans in particular are simply not going to accept. A coordinated campaign to reinforce the distinction between a \u201Csoftware wallet\u201D and an \u201Cexchange account\u201D could offer significant long-term benefits in the regulatory debate.","This term is not widely used \u2013 in fact I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever heard it until I saw this from Twitter user @porteaux. But I\u2019m quite fond of it.","This has the advantage, first, of being accurate. I\u2019m not certain exactly when the term \u201Cwallet\u201D was coined (it\u2019s not in the Bitcoin white paper), but it was very early in the evolution of crypto. Describing custodial services as \u201Cwallets\u201D of any sort came much later.","More importantly, I like that this term has a baked-in value judgment. If software or hardware wallets are \u201Ctrue\u201D crypto wallets, then an exchange or other custodial service is by necessity offering a \u201Cfalse wallet\u201D \u2013 and no one wants a fake. \u201CTrue wallet\u201D highlights that other uses of the term may be employed in bad faith. Which they probably are.","The true alpha terminology, though I fear the window to defend it is closing. Podcaster Stephan Livera floated the suggestion last week, and it was co-signed by cryptography pioneer Adam Back.","\n","In this usage, only a tool that holds keys locally is a crypto \u201Cwallet\u201D at all, and any other modifiers or caveats are suspect. In this schema, your crypto on Coinbase or Kraken isn\u2019t in a wallet at all, just an account. Unfortunately, it may be too late to reclaim this rhetorical high ground after years of obfuscation by regulators and (to a lesser extent) exchanges.","In the long term, which of these terms becomes dominant will shape public perception \u2013 and while there\u2019s no obvious evidence, it\u2019s safe to assume that regulators chose their terms very carefully to stack the deck in their favor. To counter their efforts, the crypto industry should favor terminology that emphasizes user control and independence \u2013 values that Americans in particular would be quite unhappy to see eroded by new rules, perhaps even if they\u2019re not crypto users themselves.","This isn\u2019t necessarily a conscious process. Terms that contain subtle, implicit bias can have a major role in shaping public sentiment, even (perhaps especially) among people who are barely paying attention. As crypto confronts an intensifying fight for its right to exist, it\u2019s vital the broader public understands exactly what regulators are trying to take away."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Internal Revenue Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Treasury Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Spruce","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gregory Rocco","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Twitter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Adam Back","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Trump","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Stephan Livera","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Financial Action Task Force","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Spruce Systems","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Wallets","Privacy","Security","Regulation","FinCEN","IRS","Treasury Department"],"authors":["David Z.
