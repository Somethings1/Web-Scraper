The applicants include Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco\/Galaxy, Ark\/21Shares and Franklin Templeton.","Exchanges supporting various applicants filed revised forms with the SEC earlier on Tuesday, two individuals familiar with the situation told CoinDesk.","Officials with the SEC asked exchanges to refile using universal comments \u2013 where they all use the same wording \u2013 one individual told CoinDesk.","Several people told CoinDesk across Monday and Tuesday that SEC officials haven't explicitly said they were approving the applications, but that the feedback was still significant. A final approval on the applications is still not guaranteed, but the agency asking for revisions on the 19b-4 forms suggests progress is being made. One of the individuals told CoinDesk they expect multiple approvals this week.","While the 19b-4 forms might be approved as soon as this Thursday \u2013 when the first one, an application by VanEck and Cboe, faces a final deadline \u2013 the spot ether ETFs can't launch until the SEC also approves the S-1 forms filed by the issuers themselves. There appears to be less movement on this front than with the 19b-4 filings. A few applicants have already begun revising their S-1 forms, however.","It appears that the SEC won\u2019t allow issuers to stake the potential ETFs, which several applicants, including Grayscale and Fidelity, hoped to do. Both asset managers on Tuesday filed an amended S-1 registration statement removing staking from their documents.","Ether's price traded around $3,790 as of press time according to CoinGecko, up 3.8% over the last 24 hours and maintaining a $600 jump from its price on Monday before optimism for an ETF approval first resurfaced."],"entity":[{"type":"3.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3,790","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$600","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Invesco\/Galaxy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cboe","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Ether","Spot etf","exchange-traded funds"],"authors":["Helene Braun","Nikhilesh De"]}
