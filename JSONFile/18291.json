The default deposit currency for these services is the dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), which users can acquire by swapping their coin holdings via Arbitrum. The stored USDC can then be converted into USD, EUR, and CHF for transactions and expenses.","Users can establish individually owned, fully compliant bank accounts within the SafePal mobile wallet app after completing the KYC and onboarding process conducted by Fiat24 without incurring any account creation or management fees.","Additionally, users can swap crypto across more than 40 blockchains into their bank accounts and use fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro, or Swiss Franc for transactions and expenses.¬†The feature will be available on SafePal mobile wallet version 4.5.0, pending approval from Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play.","Veronica Wong, CEO and co-founder of SafePal, emphasized the importance of addressing the accessibility issues faced by crypto users to enhance onboarding and adoption.

The Visa card will initially be available in selected European regions before expanding to the rest of the continent. At the same time, the in-app banking gateway will be accessible outside the United States and to all non-U.S.-sanctioned countries.","CoinGecko data shows that SafePal\u2019s SFP tokens are up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

This should not just be a temporary surge of interest but a key impetus to strengthen the adoption of self-management for assets.\u201D","The rise in popularity of self-custody wallets has been evident since the collapse of centralized finance entities such as FTX and Celsius. Major players like¬†Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block¬†and cross-chain wallet¬†BitKeep have made significant strides in this space, reflecting the growing demand for decentralized asset management solutions."],"entity":[{"type":"winter of 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SafePal \u2013 Crypto Wallet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EUR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Paypal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 7, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"crypto Visa","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Samsung","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"KYC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Veronica Wong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"euro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Fiat24","Investment","SafePal"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
