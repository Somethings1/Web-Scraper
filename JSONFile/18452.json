(FDIC), which was appointed as the bank\u2019s receiver, has estimated a loss of $54 million from its insurance fund to protect depositors. ","The substantial loss is an indication of the severity of the situation, given that Heartland had total assets of only $139 million. ","Shareholders, including Hanes and his family, face the possibility of losing their investments as the bank\u2019s stock was owned by a separate holding company.","The incident has also drawn the attention of law enforcement agencies. ","FBI agents have been conducting investigations, questioning community leaders with ties to the bank. ","The FBI, however, has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of an investigation. ","The exact details of the crypto scam that ensnared Hanes remain unclear.","However, a warning issued by the US Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network suggested that it was probably a pig butchering scam. ","Meanwhile, Hanes has not been accused of any wrongdoing.","He has resigned from his positions on the school board and the Kansas Bankers Association and is awaiting the outcome of the ongoing investigation.","The collapse of Heartland comes as four major US lenders have failed so far this year, including Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and First Republic Bank.","Among these banks, the failure of Silvergate and Signature was partly related to the 2022 crypto meltdown. "],"entity":[{"type":"Elkhart","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Silvergate Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$12 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Shan Hanes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hanes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$54 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kansas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$139 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tri-State Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kansas Bankers Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Republic Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Heartland Tri-State Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Signature Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FDIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Heartland","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Silicon Valley Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bank","Scam"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
