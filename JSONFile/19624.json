It explores the maturation of emerging tech by comparing the internet\u2019s 28-year history with crypto\u2019s initial 8 years.","\u201CThese networks alone offer little practical value,\u201D authors Eric Risley and Arjun Mehra wrote. \u201CBut just as a blank canvas inspires art, these networks have inspired the creation of countless software applications.\u201D","Risley and Mehra suggest that crypto can learn from the internet\u2019s past \u2014 as both share \u201Cfamilial DNA.\u201D","Their report is timely as crypto is still looking to establish itself, despite gaining significant attention from TradFi institutions.","The news tried to make people believe the internet was a \u201Cpassing fad\u201D","Now they are trying to do the same thing to Crypto and AI. pic.twitter.com\/DJb9dOOdur","\u2014 Crypto Culture (@CryptoCult_BTC) February 1, 2024","","This theme is also examined in billionaire venture capitalist Chris Dixon\u2019s new book titled \u201CRead Write Own: Constructing the Next Era of the Internet.\u201D","The internet did not seem promising initially but became the foundation for many important modern applications. Yet, it\u2019s ended up serving as the bedrock for numerous crucial applications we rely on today.","Architect Partner\u2019s report highlights that the groundwork for the internet was laid in the 1960s. But a reliable way for computers to communicate with each other was lacking. It wasn\u2019t until March 1992 that the internet protocol suite TCP\/IP finally filled that gap.","Starting with basic web pages, the evolution led to the emergence of platforms like AOL, Yahoo, and Netscape in the mid-1990s, referred to as Web1.","But the story didn\u2019t end there. In the late \u201990s, the internet saw a massive influx of investment, driving tech innovation, personal computer adoption, and the development of new software tools.","\u201CSome of today\u2019s most notable leaders were founded, including Amazon, Google, Salesforce, Equinix, Expedia, and Netflix,\u201D the authors wrote. Eventually, as the \u201990s wrapped up, over 400 million people used the Internet daily.","Between 1995 and 2000, big money poured into internet companies, pushing the tech sector\u2019s value to $5.6 trillion by 1999. But it all crashed in 2000, making the skeptics look right.","By 2000, there was a shortage of risk capital, and the skeptics were proven right. Over 74% of what seemed like inflated value vanished by 2002.","Despite challenges, innovation persisted. Facebook, YouTube, Skype, Workday, and DocuSign succeeded by embracing the internet\u2019s capabilities. By 2006, it was clear that the internet was the foundation for almost everything valuable.","\u201CWhat felt like breakneck innovation actually took 34 years \u2013 almost half a lifetime,\u201D the authors said.","The report concludes with a fundamental question: whether crypto will be accepted like the internet or remain an outlier?"],"entity":[{"type":"Eric Risley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Amazon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 1, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Arjun Mehra","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Netflix","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1960s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"74%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crypto Culture","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Salesforce","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AOL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5.6 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1995","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2006","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Yahoo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2000","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Expedia","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2002","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Netscape","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Workday","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chris Dixon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1999","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Equinix","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 1992","content":"DATE"},{"type":"TCP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Skype","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["CRYPTO","Research","Web3"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
