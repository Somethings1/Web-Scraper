The company is currently fielding multiple lawsuits and probes by the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the US Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.","The different government agencies all more or less say the same thing: Binance\u2019s lack of KYC and AML guardrails enables laundering and amounts to criminal conduct.","On the flipside, crypto\u2019s transparent blockchain has actually helped fight crime.","In 2019, law enforcement officials used Chainalysis software and analysis to bring about the shutdown of the largest CSAM website by volume of material stored, alongside the arrests of the owner and operator.","Chainalysis\u2019s recent crime report gives an example in which New York law enforcement officers trained in blockchain analysis identified the administrator of a large CSAM dark web retailer, made two arrests, and rescued a 12-year-old victim.",""],"entity":[{"type":"US Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Internal Revenue Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monero","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monero","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CSAM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Chainalysis","Monero","xrm"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
