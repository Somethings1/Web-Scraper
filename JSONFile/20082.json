These transactions increased the hacker\u2019s Ether holdings by over $1 million.","#Hundred Finance hacker moves stolen assets a year after $7M exploit :\nThe #hacker holds about $4.3 million in various #crypto assets in their #Ethereum wallet.","On May 1, the hacker moved #Ether and #Tether worth about $800,000 from #Curve\u2019s decentralized exchange (#DEX) after\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/s1fQxD2zL7","\u2014 TOBTC (@_TOBTC) May 2, 2024","","As a result, the hacker now holds a total of $6.48 million worth of crypto assets, including $4.39 million worth of Ether, $1.24 million DAI, $426,000 of Wrapped Ether, $412,000 of FRAX, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Bitcoin.","Hundred Finance, a project on the Optimism blockchain, suffered a security breach in 2023, losing $7.4 million in assets.","According to Peckshield, a popular on-chain security firm, the criminal inflated the exchange rate for hWBTC by donating 200 WBTC. With a tiny amount of hWBTC, they managed to drain Hundred Finance\u2019s lending pools. The exploit was analyzed as a combination of flash loans, critical rounding error, and smart contract manipulation.","The movement of funds from the Hundred Finance attack mirrors a recent report on a similar incident. Earlier this week, CryptoNews reported that the attacker behind the Poloniex security breach had transferred the funds after months of dormancy.","The hacker stole assets worth $33M from the exchange in 2023. A few days ago, they transferred 501 BTC (approximately $32M) to three new wallet addresses to hide the assets\u2019 origin.","Many analysts believe it might be difficult for the Hundred Finance hacker to conceal the asset\u2019s origin or convert it to fiat without a trace.","To succeed in any of these, the perpetrator has to break the traceability chain that links the funds to the hacked wallet before cashing it out \u2013 which is a tall order, as it seems. Typically, crypto mixer services like Samourai Wallet or Tornado Cash \u2013 where his exploit originated \u2013 would have provided a convenient cover to launder the funds. However, with US regulators breathing down their necks, these services are no longer a viable option for criminals.","Last week, the creators of Samourai Wallet founders were arrested and charged by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over the alleged laundering of $100 million from an illicit market and helping criminals to launder $1.7B.","Today, the #FBI, IRS, and partners arrested the founders of the Samourai Wallet cryptocurrency service, which allowed criminals to launder over $1.7B in funds.
