In addition, an option to trade a synthetic stock token also exists via the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Mirror Protocol (MIR).","At the time of writing (11:36 UTC), Tesla stock tokens on FTX stood at USD 1,098, up by about 1.26% compared to Friday\u2019s closing price on Wall Street of USD 1,084.47.","At the same time, Mirror Protocol\u2019s synthetic Tesla token (mTSLA), which is traded against the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and usually trades at a premium, traded at UST 1,121, about 3.4% higher than Tesla\u2019s closing price on Friday.","It is worth noting, however, that trading volume in both of these markets is relatively tiny, with only USD 50,647 worth of Tesla stock tokens changing hands on FTX over the past 24 hours. On Terra\u2019s Terraswap decentralized exchange, only USD 44,655 worth of mTSLA tokens were traded over the same time period.","Still, the fact that Bloomberg highlighted the weekend price moves of Tesla stock token shows that these markets are getting noticed and possibly taken more seriously by traditional investors and institutions.","Despite small volume, the markets could represent useful input for stock traders who are otherwise left in the dark overnight and during weekends when traditional stock markets are closed.","With crypto markets, including tokenized real assets, trading 24\/7, a market is now always available, opening up a new way for both individual traders and institutions to hedge their bets and manage risks outside of regular hours.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Bitcoin Rally Gets Support From \u2018Watershed\u2019 Executive Order, Rising Stock Market\n\u2013 Fed Raises Interest Rate by 25 Basis Points in First Rate Hike Since 2018\n\n\u2013 Crypto Market Tries to Recover With Ukraine Negotiations in Focus; Gold & Commodities Rise\n\u2013 Pandemic Has Accelerated Crypto Market\u2019s Transformation Into Commodity Market \u2013 Research\n\n\u2013 IMF Economists: Crypto Is Not on the Fringe Anymore, Correlation with Stocks Poses Risks\n\u2013 Most Cryptos Correlated with Stocks, Not with Gold \u2013 Analysts"],"entity":[{"type":"Tesla","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Rising Stock Market\n\u2013 Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"3.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra\u2019s Terraswap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Rate Hike Since 2018\n\n\u2013 Crypto Market Tries to Recover With Ukraine Negotiations in Focus; Gold & Commodities Rise\n\u2013 Pandemic Has Accelerated Crypto Market","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fringe Anymore","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1.26%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Rally","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["China","Coronavirus","Cryptocurrency","DeFi","Finance","Market","Stocks","Terra","Tesla","Trading"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
