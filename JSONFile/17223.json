SEC briefs are FINISHED!","And I think the SEC went out with a whimper here.","It didn't even try to attack ODL sales, just noting that Ripple was trying to re-litigate the issue (which it is).","And it brought nothing new on damages.","Just waiting for The Judge now! https:\/\/t.co\/r8nxNMTzqj pic.twitter.com\/Futa93lXUb","\u2014 Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) May 8, 2024","","Now, all that\u2019s left to do is wait for the judge to reach a decision, with the SEC filing what is likely its final reply yesterday.","Noted lawyer Jeremy Hogan expects a decision by July, or September at the latest.","Either way, a final settlement will enable Ripple to cut its losses (in terms of paying a fine) and move on with its business.","It will be able to expand its cross-border payments business again, and investors will feel more confident in XRP.","As a result, the XRP price could rally significantly, potentially reaching $1 by the end of the year.","","Given that XRP will have to wait at least a few more months to make a really big move, traders looking for big short-term gains may prefer to investigate newer tokens.","One of the newest and most interesting coins in the space right now is WienerAI (WAI), an ERC-20 token that has raised over $1.3 million in its popular presale.","Don't be left out in the cold.","GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT","ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ pic.twitter.com\/I69IUJanLC","\u2014 WienerAI (@WienerDogAI) May 8, 2024","","With a name like WienerAI, casual observers may be forgiven for assuming that WAI is just another potentially viral meme coin.","Yet it also boasts some real utility, with the coin serving as the native token for the WienerAI trading bot.","As a trading-focused chatbot, WienerAI will answer trading queries and help investors identify high-potential tokens.","It will also enable the same traders to purchase tokens, with the bot featuring an atomic swap function through which users can purchase any recommended token.","On top of this, WienerAI will also include front-running protection, meaning it will enable traders to make trades ahead of any bots looking to take advantage of cross-platform arbitrage opportunities.","These features are why investors are flocking to the coin\u2019s presale, with WAI coming with a max supply of 69 billion tokens.","STAKE NOW and fill your wallet with beautiful Wieners!!!","Current staking apy is over 2000%!","Buy and stake here: https:\/\/t.co\/FCpYSr1k8g","ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ pic.twitter.com\/FSIVZ3tXUr","\u2014 WienerAI (@WienerDogAI) April 21, 2024","","Holders will also be able to stake the token, with its yield currently standing at close to 700%.","Investors can join its sale by visiting the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI is selling for $0.000705.","Buy WAI Today",""],"entity":[{"type":"May 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jeremy Hogan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"700%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$0.5136","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 21, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"17%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$0.000705","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"WAI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"XRP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Price Prediction","Ripple","XRP"],"authors":["Simon Chandler"]}
