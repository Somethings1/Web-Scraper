The reason people are buying dollar on binance, is because they don't have it available at their banks easily.\nThe reason the banks dont have it is because we have not got enough.","So why dont we have enough?\nWell there is too much demand.\u2026","\u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) February 20, 2024","","In recent weeks, the naira has been in free fall due to recently introduced policies. Its value has plunged 70% to the dollar since June 2023.","This led the government to hint at a broader cryptocurrency ban, which includes centralized exchanges accusing them of market manipulation and sabotage.","For most Nigerian traders, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and centralized exchanges are not the reason for the falling naira valuation.","Local traders blamed the current predicament on government corruption, while others pointed to policies adopted by the former administration.

Tell me why Naira won\u2019t experience a meltdown?\u201D","Similarly, Toyin Omotoso explained that the Nigerian government is chasing the wrong things with reports on the hard cap on USDT sales on Binance. He predicts a downtrend for the naira if the issues are not fixed.","\u201CNaija government is busy using force to fight Naira devaluation. Why is EFCC arresting BDC merchants up and down, forcing Binance to put a hard cap on USDT sales, etc as if these will stop anything. Doing all these instead of doing the things that are dragging down to Naira to hell.\u201D","X users also criticized the cap imposed on Binance, calling for a reversal to allow a free market. Conversely, pro-government accounts backed the moves with hopes of strengthening the naira.","This week, several government officials have blamed the naira woes on the cryptocurrency market claiming that centralized platforms are used by market manipulators.","Consequently, they took action, including arresting some currency traders, saying they didn\u2019t have licenses.
