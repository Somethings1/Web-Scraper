The firm warned of \u201Cmalicious actors who are lurking on dating apps.\u201D These attackers, it said, \u201Cappear to be becoming more crypto-savvy.\u201D","The case in point involved a crypto investor and Casa client who found a match on Tinder, a woman who claimed to share his interest in cryptoassets.","The man began to chat with the woman and the duo eventually agreed to meet up in person. On the date, though, the man\u2019s suspicions were briefly piqued when his date appeared to look very different from her profile picture and spoke very little about crypto, simply mentioning that she said her parents had \u201Cbought her BTC 1 for USD 30,000.\u201D","But after spending time at a coffee shop, the client and the woman went for a walk \u2013 before going back to his place. But while they had drinks at his domicile, he left to go to the toilet. Returning, he continued to consume his drink \u2013 before, Jameson Lopp, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Casa, explained:","\u201CWe suspect the woman laced our client\u2019s drink with scopolamine, also known as \u2018Devil\u2019s Breath,\u2019 or a benzodiazepine. These drugs are well known to cause loss of inhibition and memory loss.\u201D","This apparent stunt caused the man to lose his inhibitions. Lopp continued:","\u201CHis memories are fuzzy after this point, but the client recalls drinking a bit more after returning from the restroom.\u201D","\u201CSome time later,\u201D the client was quoted as saying, the woman \u201Cpicked up his phone and asked him to show her how to unlock it and find his passwords.\u201D","The custody provider added that \u201CHe knew that something didn\u2019t seem right, but his inhibitions and safeguards had been stripped away. The last thing he remembers is kissing her.\u201D","Casa claimed that it did not believe that the attack \u201Cwas solely perpetrated by the woman he met,\u201D writing:","\u201CShe most likely handed the phone over to someone else, possibly a criminal organization, to get to work draining his various accounts as quickly as possible. The woman was most likely acting as a social engineer.\u201D","The victim incurred very minor losses, and was \u201Cunable to function lucidly for an estimated 24 hours.\u201D But a \u201Csmall amount of bitcoin\u201D was removed from the client\u2019s exchange accounts.","Lopp wrote:","\u201CHe was able to block some of the other requested purchases and withdrawals by contacting those custodians to inform them of the compromise. Since the attacker only had one of the client\u2019s five keys to his Casa multisig, those funds could not be spent.\u201D","But the moral of the story, perhaps, is that the client was using a two-factor authentication (2FA) solution that involved making use of the Google Authenticator app on their smartphone \u2013 meaning that anyone who had gained access to his phone could essentially access his otherwise unprotected crypto wallets. The Google app was not password protected: Once the attacker had access to his phone, they also had access to the authenticator. A number of major crypto exchanges use 2FA solutions like Google Authenticator to prevent fraud.","On Twitter, the Casa CEO Nick Neuman explained:","\u201CNo funds were able to be stolen from his Casa account, where he kept the majority of his assets. He had set up a properly distributed 3-of-5 multisig, so it was impossible to steal the majority of his bitcoin in this attack.\u201D","In East Asian nations such as Japan, similar cases are also on the rise, although many of these do not involve in-person meetings, and are instead taking advantage of coronavirus-related travel bans.","Earlier this year, the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan, a consumer watchdog, said the number of complaints it received from men using international dating apps more than doubled last year. This figure has been bolstered by an influx of \u201Ccrypto-keen\u201D women ostensibly based in other Asian locations persuading men to move their tokens and fiat to bona fide-looking crypto platforms that then turn out to be bogus.","One man was reportedly duped into parting with some USD 16,150 by a woman he had fallen for on a dating app \u2013 who later convinced him to \u201Cjoin her\u201D in an investment on a crypto platform. The platform later proved to be an elaborately designed fake.\n____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Despite the Crackdown, Crypto Fraudsters Still Run Amok in China\n\u2013 South African \u2018Exit Scam\u2019 Sees Brothers Vanish with USD 3.6B in Bitcoin","\u2013 Ledger Hack Saga Continues: Scammers \u2018Gifting\u2019 Fake Hardware Wallets\n\u2013 \u2018Flood\u2019 of Crypto Scam Cases Hit Spanish Courts"],"entity":[{"type":"Nick Neuman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brothers Vanish","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Casa","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google Authenticator","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Fraudsters Still Run Amok","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jameson Lopp","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Casa multisig","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Breath","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Crime","Cryptocurrency","Scam","Security"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
