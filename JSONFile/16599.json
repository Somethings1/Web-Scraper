Four years later, in 2018, it discontinued all of those efforts, arguing that bitcoin was too volatile and would function as an asset rather than a medium of exchange. It had also criticized its lengthy transaction times and growing fees at the time.","That year saw bitcoin\u2019s first \u201Ccrypto winter\u201D with the token dropping from a high of $19,650 in December 2017 to $3,401 at the end of 2018.","The fintech giant took a step toward re-entering the market the following year by becoming a co-founder of Facebook\u2019s Libra project, but it stepped away later that year and Libra never got off the ground. In 2022, Stripe introduced a project to facilitate fiat-to-crypto payments.","\u201CCrypto is finding real utility,\u201D Collison said in his keynote Thursday. \u201CWith transaction speeds increasing and costs coming down, we\u2019re seeing crypto finally making sense as a means of exchange.\u201D","Payments will be available on the Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains, Stripe said.","The company is currently valued at $65 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is one of the biggest payments providers in the world with over $1 trillion in transactions in 2023.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$19,650","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$65 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Stripe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3,401","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Collison","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"John Collison","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Stripe","payments","Circle","USDC","Stablecoins"],"authors":["Helene Braun"]}
