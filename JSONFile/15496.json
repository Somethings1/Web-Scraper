Although crypto advocates often think about the suite of these peer-to-peer blockchain-based tools and currencies as advancing human freedom and financial liberty, for years it\u2019s been known that only a small percentage of crypto transactions actually happen between everyday people.","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","This was backed up by a recent report co-authored by Visa and data firm Allium Labs into stablecoin use, which found that less than 10% of stablecoin transactions \u2013 or just $149 billion the $2.2 trillion total trading volume \u2014 in April were \u201Cmade by real people.\u201D The firms created a new metric measuring \u201Corganic payments activity\u201D by filtering out bots and large-scale traders (likely meaning entities like exchanges).","The news certainly seems to poke a hole in the idea that stablecoins are on a rollicking adoption curve, with uptake happening across the globe \u2014 particularly in developing economies where users are turning to dollar-backed assets like Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC to protect themselves from inflation and onerous capital controls.","Indeed, stablecoins have emerged as one of the clear areas of crypto that seem to have both a clear product-market fit and real-life users. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, brought in an enviable $4.5 billion in profit in the first financial quarter of the year. This is just part of the reason why everyone and their mother seems to want in the game, from established financial institutions (including Visa!) to blockchain upstarts.","So what\u2019s the story here? Are stablecoins another example of crypto overselling itself \u2014 overpromising on the idea of financial revolution and under-delivering \u2014 like the many so-called \u201CZombie Projects\u201D that have recently come into view?","To some extent, even if bots are driving more than 90% of stablecoin volumes, the numbers representing \u201Corganic use\u201D remain impressive: around 25 million unique monthly users exchanging almost $150 billion in value in April alone. That may pale in comparison to capital sloshing around on other fintech platforms, but ain\u2019t nothing to sneeze at.","But more importantly, it\u2019s worth asking why exactly Visa is so concerned with bot trading \u2014 and what it even considers to be a valid use. According to the report\u2019s methodology, the \u201Cinorganic user filter\u201D counted only \u201Ctransactions that have been sent by an account that has initiated less than 1000 stablecoin transactions and $10m in transfer volume.\u201D","See also: S&P's Stablecoin Report Is a Vote of Confidence for Crypto | Opinion","\u201CLong story short, I think there's significant problems with what Visa is trying to do,\u201D Austin Campbell, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and former fund manager for Paxos\u2019 BUSD, told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201CVisa is a payments company. They're probably trying to get a measure of crypto that to them looks like peer-to-peer or small merchant payments.\u201D","\u201CThis means trying to exclude all of trading, so not just automated trading,\u201D he said. Trading, it shouldn\u2019t have to be said, is a pretty big part of why people use crypto. Additionally, as far as Campbell can tell, Visa\u2019s report cut out wallet addresses for centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which both hold stablecoins used in services like prepaid cards, \u201Csome of which are literally Visas.\u201D","None of this is to suggest that Visa is misrepresenting the data, because, say, as a payments company, Visa\u2019s main business line could be disrupted by stablecoin adoption. Nor is it to say that having an accurate read of actual peer-to-peer stablecoin use isn\u2019t valuable info.","But to a large degree, \u201Cthe narrowness of Visa's view is more reflective of Visa than stablecoins,\u201D Campbell said.","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Austin Campbell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Campbell","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.2 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$150 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$149 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Columbia Business School","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10m","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","The Node","Newsletters","Stablecoin","Tether","Visa","Bots"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
