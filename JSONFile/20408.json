The high volumes imply demand for LUNC is rising and might validate a sustainable uptrend.","Terra Luna Classic Price is dancing at the apex of a symmetrical triangle pattern while getting ready to fly above its immediate resistance, as observed at $0.00018 in confluence with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in purple).","Market participants trading the symmetrical triangle for the first time may need to understand that this pattern is formed as the price moves into a tighter and tighter range, culminating in a fierce battle between bulls and bears.","From the four-hour time frame chart below, we see Terra Luna Classic price consolidating within the confines of two trend lines: One connecting the higher lows and the other linking its lower highs.","Terra Luna Classic price is now on the verge of a breakout as long as bulls win the battle and push above the triangle\u2019s resistance, reinforced with the 200-day EMA.

Such a listing would expose LUNC to a wider audience in the United States and could be a catalyst for Terra Luna Classic price rally.","As Terra Luna Classic price recovers, it is bound to attract attention from investors mulling over tokens considered cheap to buy. For now, a move above $0.00018 is required to keep user interest intact. However, a break above $0.0002 and subsequently the triangle target at $0.00021 could boost LUNC price to \u2018eat\u2019 another zero and start another recovery phase above $0.001.","Whether LUNC price will hit $3 in 2023 depends on how the crypto market generally behaves throughout the year.
