The entity, according to the SFC, falsely represents \u201CLaura Cha\u201D as its Chairman and \u201CNicolas Aguzin\u201D as its Chief Executive Officer. However, neither individual has any affiliations with BitCuped.","The commission urges the public to exercise caution when encountering investment opportunities and advice on social media platforms and instant messaging apps.","This cautionary note comes amid a global push by regulatory bodies to safeguard investors from the increasing threats within the cryptocurrency and virtual asset space.","The SFC reiterates the importance of vigilance and prudence, particularly when making investment decisions, in order to mitigate the risks associated with potential fraudulent schemes. Investors are advised to conduct thorough due diligence and verify the legitimacy of entities before engaging in any financial transactions.","Earlier, Hong Kong witnessed a massive crypto fraud when law enforcement agencies discovered the JPEX scandal that ballooned up to $200 million."],"entity":[{"type":"Hong Kong Police Force","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong Digital Currency Exchange Licence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Laura Cha","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$200 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nicolas Aguzin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"HKD Token","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Hong Kong"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
