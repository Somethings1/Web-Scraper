[\u2026] I would guess it\u2019s sometimes in the next 6 months to 3 years.\u201D ","Certain things need to occur in order for the bull to return, Voorhees suggested. There is also some amount of time necessary \u201Cfor people\u2019s minds to start changing and speculative cycles to return.\u201D","The CEO stated \u201CIt also has a lot to do with the macro environment. So as long as the interest rates are held high, monetary conditions are tighter, it\u2019s gonna be a headwind. But [\u2026] that will start changing in early to mid-next year. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if bitcoin was at like 40K by the summer, that wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all. And that\u2019s like 2.5X from here, so that\u2019s a great return.\u201D","Voorhees had some lessons and warnings to share about both the bull and the bear markets \u2013 certain common denominators seen every time during each cycle.","Not unique to crypto, he said, but \u201Cwhen the bullishness is happening, people\u2019s skepticism and judgment fall way too low\u201D and they\u2019re willing to accept anything. That is the time when \u201Call the stupid ideas get just as much money as the good ones, there is no discretion, and everyone is making money doing everything.\u201D","Therefore, Voorhees warned that,","\u201CDuring a bull market, remembering to stay sane means [asking] yourself if this thing is actually useful or it\u2019s just stupid. [\u2026] Don\u2019t follow the crowd, because they\u2019ll go into everything.\u201D","Meanwhile, in the bear market, people are \u201Cfar too bearish, and they dismiss the whole thing.\u201D The technology hasn\u2019t suddenly changed between the bull and the bear markets, it will work just the same in either one \u2013 meaning that it is the users\u2019 opinion of it that turns negative. ","The bear market advice would be to buy and build, but also to \u201Cjust remember to live your lives, crypto is not everything,\u201D he said. ","You can watch the full interview here: ","","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Crypto Winter Will Last \u2018At Least Another Year\u2019 Says Founder of Crypto Firm Which Just Laid Off 40% of Its Workforce\n\u2013 Prepare for \u2018Pretty Long Crypto Winter\u2019\n\n\u2013 Erik Voorhees Introduces the ShapeShift DAO\n\u2013 ShapeShift DAO Launches a New Mobile App\n\n\u2013 Can An Algorithmic Stablecoin Ever Succeed?\n\u2013 Erik Voorhees Explains Why He Thinks Toxic Bitcoin Maximalism Is Bullshit"],"entity":[{"type":"2026","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Winter Will Last","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Voorhees","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u2018Pretty Long Crypto Winter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Erik Voorhees","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Forecast","Market"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
