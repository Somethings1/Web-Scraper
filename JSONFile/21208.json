It was a simple domain that gave those who visited instructions on purchasing Bitcoin via PayPal. However, after landing in hot water with PayPal, the website renamed and reinvented itself in true Web2 fashion. ","Today\u2019s ICO launch kickstarts 99Bitcoins\u2019 transition to Web3 with the revealing of the $99BTC token, which promises a groundbreaking earn-as-you-learn experience for users of the website. ","What is Spatial Computing?

The team is selling 15% of them over the course of a fourteen-round presale to raise the funds needed to expedite cutting-edge development around the project\u2019s BRC-20 integration.","Today, BTC casually trades above its former all-time high of $69k (set during the 2021 bull run)  as it prepares for next month\u2019s halving, which looks set to drive its price higher than its current ATH of $74k. ","The Bitcoin network is also expanding thanks to the addition of more Layer 2 protocols and the proliferation of the BRC-20 token standard. These things give the green light on a potentially explosive rally for Bitcoin\u2019s number one learn-to-earn platform. ","Through its revolutionary Learn-to-Earn model, 99Bitcoins uses a blend of gamification and a leaderboard reward system to make users feel like their learning is bearing tangible (spendable) benefits. Simply put, users earn crypto while learning about crypto.","The gamification aspect comes about through various different learning resources, like interactive learning modules, quizzes, and tutorials. Successful completion of these challenges will accordingly raise a user\u2019s 99Bitcoins ranking; the higher the ranking, the greater the payout. ","As users go about learning and completing the exercises, they\u2019ll unlock more courses, which means more rewards thanks to the self-regulating learn-to-earn model, which makes the learning experience engaging and enjoyable for all users.","For today\u2019s highly switched-on and video game and tech-fluent generation, it certainly beats textbooks.  ","The new 99Bitcoins platform will offer comprehensive curricula on various blockchain topics at all levels from wallet basics and how-to guides all the way through to trading signals, strategies, trends, and technical knowledge. ","$99BTC is launching as an ERC-20 token and will bridge to BRC-20 as a core focus of the project\u2019s roadmap, enabling native integration with the growing ecosystem of dApps and projects built on Bitcoin.","Those projects include tokens like ORDI and SATS, both of which are pumping today (adding 32% and 7% to their respective prices over the last seven days) as the Bitcoin network continues to expand its offering to rival its high-functionality smart contract rivals. ","$99BTC holders gain access to a variety of benefits and services. Besides getting paid for learning about crypto, platform users can also earn staking rewards on Ethereum, receive special training courses, exclusive trading webinars, trading signals and strategies, and access to VIP community groups. ","Those who progress through the courses, or actively participate in the community, will earn $99BTC directly in their Ethereum wallet. They can then redeem the tokens for exclusive access to premium content, discounts on partner products and services, and token holder events. ","Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving around April 20 promises to be another strong price driver. That\u2019s the date when Bitcoin\u2019s code slashes mining rewards in half, effectively constricting the issuance of new BTC. ","","Given consistent levels of demand, the halving will push Bitcoin\u2019s price higher. Historically, halvings have consistently led to bull runs, which have added value to the entire market, even to projects not connected to Bitcoin. ","Analysts don\u2019t expect this year will be any different. Some even suggest Bitcoin\u2019s price could go ballistic this year. That\u2019s largely due to the increased institutional and retail demand for Bitcoin since the historic launch of 11 Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) on January 11 this year. ","In addition to the presale opportunity, 99Bitcoins is also running a massive airdrop of $99,999 worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This will be exclusively for early supporters who follow the instructions on the official website.","The fun doesn\u2019t just end there, though. There\u2019s also a giveaway, according to an announcement on the platform\u2019s X\/Twitter. The protocol is collectively rewarding three participants with $99,999 worth of Bitcoin for either following, retweeting, or signing up on the website.  ","","99Bitcoins also has its own mobile apps available for download on Google Play and App Store, keeping users up-to-date on all the latest crypto prices and news.","So, with Bitcoin leading the news cycle through April and beyond, there will likely be many new BTC neophytes in the coming months. ","What better incentive to learn about Bitcoin through expert learning materials than to get paid for it?","Visit the secure presale website today to Buy 99Bitcoins. ",""],"entity":[{"type":"$99BTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"32%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Twitter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin (BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$74k","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 11 this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$99,999","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2009","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$69k","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"VIP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BRC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["99bitcoins","99btc","BRC20"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
