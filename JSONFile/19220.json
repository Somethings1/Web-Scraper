According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Kraken has provided unregistered crypto trading and transaction services to the public and allegedly created risks for its investors.","\u201CWithout registering with the SEC in any capacity, Kraken has simultaneously acted as a broker, dealer, exchange, and clearing agency with respect to these crypto asset securities.\u201D The SEC wrote in the filing, \u201CIn doing so, Kraken has created risk for investors and taken in billions of dollars in fees and trading revenue from investors without adhering to or even recognizing the requirements of the U.S. securities laws that are designed to protect investors.\u201D","In addition, the SEC also stated that the company posed \u201Csignificant risks\u201D by mixing the users\u2019 and investors\u2019 crypto assets with its own corporate assets. \u201CFor example, Kraken has at times held customer crypto assets valued at more than $33 billion, but it has commingled these crypto assets with its own,\u201D said the SEC.","The SEC proceeded with specific instances to specify Kraken\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. \u201CIn fact, Kraken has at times paid operational expenses directly from bank accounts that hold customer cash,\u201D said the SEC. The agency also believed that according to the independent auditor, issues \u201Crelated to Kraken\u2019s recordkeeping of customer custodial assets\u201D have resulted in \u201Cmaterial errors to Kraken\u2019s financial statements for 2020 and 2021.\u201D","The accused Kraken\u2019s operation of acting as an unregistered broker, dealer, exchange, and clearing agency mirrors the SEC\u2019s ongoing lawsuits filed earlier this year against Binance and Coinbase. The SEC also sued the crypto exchange Bittrex for offering unregistered securities in April. Bittrex received its bankruptcy approval in October to cease its operations in the U.S.","Kraken has responded to the lawsuit filing with a blog post, claiming that the SEC\u2019s complaint \u201Calleges no fraud, no market manipulation, no customer losses due to hacking or compromised security, and no breaches of fiduciary duty.\u201D","\u201CInstead, the complaint makes a technical argument: that Kraken\u2019s business requires special securities licenses to operate because the digital assets we support are really \u2018investment contracts,\u2019\u201D said the exchange.","Regarding the accusation of commingling its own funds with the clients\u2019, the company said that it is a \u201Callegation already made of other crypto trading platforms\u201D and hyperlinked the SEC\u2019s filing against Coinbase.","\u201CThe SEC cannot and does not allege that any customer funds are missing, or any loss has occurred. Nor does it allege that any loss will occur,\u201D said the blog post. \u201CThe complaint itself concedes that this so-called \u2018commingling\u2019 is no more than Kraken spending fees it has already earned.\u201D","We strongly disagree with the SEC claims, stand firm in our view that we do not list securities, and plan to vigorously defend our position.","As we have seen before, the SEC argues that @krakenfx should \u201Ccome in and register\u201D with the agency, when there is no clear path to\u2026","\u2014 Dave Ripley (@DavidLRipley) November 21, 2023","","Kraken CEO Dave Ripley also voiced his disagreement with the SEC\u2019s accusation, demonstrating the support for the Congressional action to resolve the \u201Clack of regulatory clarity in the U.S.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Payward Ventures, Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dave Ripley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Congressional","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$33 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Payward Trading Ltd","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 21, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"North District of California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Kraken","SEC"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
