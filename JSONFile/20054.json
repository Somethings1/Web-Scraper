It added that in all, more than USD 23bn in digital assets, including USD 4.2bn worth of ETH, have been bridged from Ethereum to Layer-2 networks and other Layer-1 blockchains.","Growth in TVL on Ethereum L2 networks:","The large growth seen in the use of Layer-2 networks is perhaps surprising given the fall that has been seen in transaction fees on Ethereum over the same period. Ethereum for a long time completely dominated the space of blockchains for DeFi protocols, but has recently seen more usage shift to Layer-2 chains like Polygon (MATIC) and Arbitrum.","A Layer-2 network is a separate blockchain built on top of a blockchain (Layer-1), typically used by users who require faster and cheaper transactions. In addition to Ethereum-based networks, other networks such as Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and BNB Chain (BNB) are also increasingly favored by DeFi users.","The fees, which have long been high and served as the primary reason why users migrated to Layer-2 networks and other blockchains, are now down at an average of USD 2.98, the report said.","That compares to an average transaction fee of USD 14.93 as of the end of Q1 last year \u2013 a reduction of 80% over the course of a year.","Despite the drop in the average transaction fee paid, the total amount paid by users for transacting on the network \u2013 known as the network revenue \u2013 continued to rise year-over-year.","According to the report, network revenue increased 46% from the first quarter of last year, from USD 1.6bn to USD 2.4bn. Out of this, USD 2.48bn \u2013 or 87% \u2013 was removed from the circulating supply of ETH through the burning mechanism that was introduced with EIP-1559, the report said.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Layer 2 in 2022: Get Ready for Rollups, Bridges, New Apps, Life With Ethereum 2.0, and Layer 3\n\u2013 How to Use Layer-2 Solutions to Save on Ethereum Fees: StarkWare\n\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin Says His Influence Over Ethereum Diminishing, Harder to Make Things Happen\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Crypto Holding Made Up of 99% ETH\n\u2013 Bitcoin Funds See Slowing Investment Outflows, Ethereum Outflows Accelerate\n\n\u2013 Buterin Claims Ethereum Simplicity is Still Possible, as Developers Warn of Increasing Complexity\n\u2013 Ethereum Developer Says Merge Delayed Until a \u2018Few Months After\u2019 June"],"entity":[{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum Outflows Accelerate\n\n\u2013 Buterin Claims Ethereum Simplicity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"87%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"99%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"964%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"first quarter of last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AVAX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1559","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Developers Warn of Increasing Complexity\n\u2013 Ethereum Developer Says Merge Delayed Until","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New Apps","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum\u2019s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["DeFi","Ethereum","Fees","Layer-2"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
