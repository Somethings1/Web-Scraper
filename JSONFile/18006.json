The SEC also maintains its stance on the likelihood of Ripple engaging in similar actions in the future.","","The remedies brief states that Ripple has tried to minimize its liability while highlighting its cooperation with the SEC since the 2013 XRP initial coin offering. However, the SEC has stressed that, per the law, another breach remains possible even if Ripple has abstained from violations since 2020.","The SEC asserts that Ripple\u2019s pledges to alter its conduct following the lawsuit do not warrant the avoidance of injunctions. It argues that Ripple doesn\u2019t understand the court order and fails to acknowledge its ramifications for compliance.","And just when you think the SEC can\u2019t sink any lower, if you are a financial regulator outside the U.S. and have done the hard work of establishing comprehensive crypto licensing frameworks, know that the SEC has no respect for you and thinks you are handing out the equivalent of\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/7qZQIkyrH4","\u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 7, 2024","","The SEC\u2019s response challenges Ripple\u2019s assertions regarding sales conducted outside the United States and to accredited investors. In response to the SEC\u2019s arguments in the remedies brief, Ripple\u2019s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, spoke on the SEC\u2019s declining reputation. ","\u201CIf you are a financial regulator outside the U.S. and have done the hard work of establishing comprehensive crypto licensing frameworks, know that the SEC has no respect for you and thinks you are handing out the equivalent of fishing licenses.\u201D","He pointed out that international financial regulators with robust crypto licensing frameworks might find the SEC\u2019s efforts surprising, likening them to issuing fishing licenses. Alderoty criticized the commission for its inconsistent application of the law and expressed optimism about resolving the XRP lawsuit.Despite Ripple\u2019s claims of acting without recklessness and minimizing uncertainty about XRP\u2019s legal status, the SEC maintains its position and questions the likelihood of Ripple engaging in similar actions.","Ripple recently opposed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s request for a $2 billion penalty, arguing that the proposed fines are disproportionate and punitive. Through its defense lawyer, James Filan, the company filed a detailed motion disputing the SEC\u2019s penalty demands, suggesting a much lower penalty of $10 million instead.The opposition emphasizes that the SEC\u2019s proposed penalties are not in line with the actual circumstances of the case. Ripple contends that no allegations or findings of reckless behavior or fraudulent activity would justify such severe financial penalties. Additionally, Ripple asserts that its XRP sales were conducted transparently and with knowledgeable institutional investors who were fully informed about the transactions.Ripple highlights its significant legal victories throughout the litigation, suggesting that the SEC\u2019s penalty demands are inconsistent with the court\u2019s findings. The company argues that the SEC\u2019s request is evidence of ongoing intimidation against the crypto industry in the United States, particularly considering the lack of allegations of recklessness or fraud in the case.Ripple proposes a much lower penalty of $10 million, which is more appropriate given the nature of the alleged violations and the company\u2019s conduct. Ripple contends that this amount would adequately serve the legal interests without being disproportionately punitive.According to analysts, the case is expected to reach a final judgment around September. The court will decide on penalties, and Ripple expresses confidence in the judge\u2019s fair approach to the final remedies phase."],"entity":[{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Stuart Alderoty","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 7, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"James Filan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the U.S.","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ripple","SEC","SEC Vs XRP"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
