The rest of the market is also in red, mostly. Binance Coin, the native token of Binance, is down by 6,66% (04:11 UTC.)

But there are concerns that if we do a rollback on the Bitcoin network at that scale, it may have some negative consequences, in terms of destroying the credibility for Bitcoin,\u201D he said, adding that \u201Cwe will consider that very, very carefully, with the feedback we are receiving.\u201D","According to recent discussions on Reddit, the crypto community is strongly against the rollback, as \u201Cany rollback is a horrible idea. This is the bitcoin version of a government bailout.\u201D","Later, the CEO confirmed that they decided against the rollback, later adding that \u201Cto put this to bed, it\u2019s not possible, bitcoin ledger is the most immutable ledger on the planet. Done.\u201D","Read more: Could this rollback happen? And what would it truly mean?","Meanwhile, Binance explained that hackers were able to obtain a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, and potentially other info.","\u201CThe hackers used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks. We are still concluding all possible methods used. There may also be additional affected accounts that have not been identified yet,\u201D the exchange said.","According to the announcement, the breach impacted thei Bitcoin hot wallet only (which contained about 2% of their total BTC holdings.)","____","\u201CThe hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-orchestrated actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time. The transaction is structured in a way that passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed. Once executed, the withdrawal triggered various alarms in our system. We stopped all withdrawals immediately after that,\u201D the exchange said, adding that the hackers were able to withdraw BTC 7,000 in this one transaction: https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/btc\/tx\/e8b406091959700dbffcff30a60b190133721e5c39e89bb5fe23c5a554ab05ea","Binance suspended deposits and withdrawals even before it announced the security breach, while their CEO claimed that \u201CFunds are #safu.\u201D","____","Trading volume on Binance:","___","As many experts have stressed previously, crypto users should keep their private keys to their coins offline, e.g. in hardware wallets such as Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey and others.","However, Changpeng Zhao earlier this year suggested that cryptocurrency users should store their private keys on an exchange."],"entity":[{"type":"1.67%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"6,66%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Exchange","Hack"],"authors":["Linas Kmieliauskas"]}
