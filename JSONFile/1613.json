Meanwhile, bugs and human errors prove costly.","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was busy this week, charging Justin Sun, Lindsay Lohan, and Jake Paul. The regulator then turned its ire on Coinbase, issuing the exchange a Wells notice for its staking service, Coinbase Earn and Coinbase Wallet products.&nbsp;","Elsewhere, research showed how costly human error and bugs can be. Here are the week's top stories.&nbsp;","Coinbase was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222084\/sec-investigating-coinbase-for-its-earn-product-wallet-service-and-exchange-activity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued<\/a> a Wells notice by the SEC on Wednesday. While this notice does not imply a conclusion or foregone action, it is issued to entities under investigation.&nbsp;","The notice was related to the firm's asset listings, staking service, Coinbase Earn and Coinbase Wallet. With regard to asset listings, this could have a significant impact on the exchange's business model \u2014 which revolves around offering a \"multitude of tradable pairs,\" Needham analyst John Todaro said.","If the exchange is forced to delist assets, it could lead to \"materially lower revenue,\" Todaro added.
