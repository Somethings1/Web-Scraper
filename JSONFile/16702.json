Sunny was barely two weeks old by early September, but billions of dollars in crypto were flooding this yield farm.","Still, Saint and others had questions: Who was behind Sunny? Why was its developer, one \u201CSurya Khosla,\u201D pseudonymous? Was its codebase audited? Would users\u2019 cash be safe?","\u201CThere was no indication of who Surya was,\u201D Saint recalled recently, \u201Cso many users didn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201D putting their crypto in.","Their suspicions proved prescient.","CoinDesk has learned who Surya was: Ian Macalinao, the chief architect of Saber, a stablecoin exchange built on top of Solana. In turn, he built Sunny Aggregator on top of Saber.","And that\u2019s just the top of the pile.","Coding as 11 purportedly independent developers, Ian, a 20-something computer wiz from Texas, created a vast web of interlocking DeFi protocols that projected billions of dollars of double-counted value onto the Saber ecosystem. That temporarily inflated the total value locked (TVL) on Solana, as the network was racing toward its zenith last November. The DeFi faithful regard TVL as a barometer for on-chain activity.","\u201CI devised a scheme to maximize Solana\u2019s TVL: I would build protocols that stack on top of each other, such that a dollar could be counted several times,\u201D Ian wrote in a never-published blog post reviewed by CoinDesk. The blog post was prepared on March 26, three days after Cashio, one of Ian\u2019s secretly built protocols, lost $52 million in a hack.","Two close to the matter confirmed the draft\u2019s authenticity.","Ian\u2019s ploy worked for a while. By his count, Saber and Sunny comprised $7.5 billion of Solana\u2019s $10.5 billion TVL at their peak. (Billions of those dollars were double-counted between his two protocols.)","\u201CI believe it contributed to the dramatic rise of SOL,\u201D Ian wrote of a time when Solana\u2019s native currency traded at $188.","Solana network\u2019s TVL continued to swell even after the Saber ecosystem began losing steam in mid-September 2021, topping at $15 billion around Nov. 9, according to data provider DeFiLlama, while Saber\u2019s TVL had by then dropped 64%.","Ian wrote he disdained this \u201Cvanity metric\u201D; nonetheless, \u201Cit bothered me that Ethereum TVL was so much higher\u201D than Solana\u2019s, because in his view, DeFi projects on Ethereum \u2013 the largest blockchain for DeFi \u2013 are \u201Cstacked\u201D to double-count deposits.","\u201CI wanted to create a system very similar to this,\u201D he wrote. One problem: \u201CIf the same team built each protocol, TVL would be more silly as a metric. Thus I created more anonymous profiles,\u201D he wrote.","Ian wore 11 masks.","In public, Ian and his brother Dylan called their anonymous personas \u201Cfriends,\u201D or \u201Cfriends of friends.\u201D Their \u201CShip Capital\u201D coder club was laying the \u201Cblueprints for my ideal DeFi ecosystem,\u201D Ian wrote in the unpublished blog. Saber and its so-called liquidity provider (LP) tokens anchored everything.","\u201CIf an ecosystem is all built by a few people, it does not look as authentic,\u201D Ian wrote in his blog post. \u201CI wanted to make it look like a lot of people were building on our protocol, rather than ship 20+ disjoint[ed] programs as one person.\u201D","The Macalinaos wanted other crypto protocols to become so dependent on Saber that \u201Cits failure would lead to the entire system going down,\u201D as Dylan phrased it on Oct. 1, 2021. \u201CBtw this is the 200 IQ [Saber Labs] strategy, but few understand\u2026\u201D","The Macalinao brothers offered no comment by press time.","There are valid reasons to seek shelter in pseudonyms. Ian\u2019s weaponized \u201Canons,\u201D however, mounted something akin to a \u201CSybil attack\u201D abusing crypto users\u2019 trust. (A Sybil attack is when a computer in a network uses bogus identities to gain disproportionate influence over the whole.)","Read more: Why CoinDesk Respects Pseudonymity: A Stand Against Doxxing","\u201CI am revealing this because it is inevitable that I will be found out,\u201D Ian wrote in his never-published blog.","Instead, the Macalinaos in May published \u201CSaber Public Goods\u201D to propagate the \u201CSaber team\u2019s\u201D prolific code across Solana. Eight of Ian\u2019s 11 secret projects appear there. Their disclosure is mum on the anons and their master. Sunny and Cashio, whose tokens imploded, don\u2019t show up, either.","Surya Khosla was Ian\u2019s moniker when building Sunny Aggregator. Surya popped onto Twitter in August 2021. Saint Eclectic, the Sunny skeptic, hesitated to deposit his LP tokens in the work of this mysterious character, an anon with an artificial intelligence-generated face.","One factor swung in Surya\u2019s favor: The Ian puppet claimed to know brother Dylan \u201Cpretty well in real life.\u201D On Sept. 9 of last year, Dylan Macalinao tweeted he \u201Cfelt comfortable\u201D putting his own crypto into Sunny Aggregator. \u201CWe audited their code,\u201D Dylan, who is in his early 20s, said.","Dylan lent Surya the credibility he needed to win over skeptics like Saint.","The problem was, the lead developer, \u201CSurya Khosla,\u201D didn\u2019t exist. Dylan\u2019s brother Ian built Sunny Aggregator. Ian had made Surya up.","It was Ian\u2019s first dalliance with assumed identities for Saber \u2013 and far from his last.","Ian wrote in March 2022 that he had created 11 \u201Danonymous founders that are actually me.\u201D","Ship Capital had many \u201Cfriends\": 0xGhostchain, who created Cashio; Goki Rajesh, builder of multi-signature wallet Goki; Larry Jarry from mining rewards aggregator Quarry; Swaglioni, the \u201Cgrandmaster\u201D of governance platform TribecaDAO; and of course Surya Khosla from Sunny Aggregator, Saber\u2019s yield farm.","These DeFi Lego bricks were the jewels of the Saber ecosystem. Lesser-known protocols Crate (run by kiwipepper), aSOL (0xAurelion), Arrow (oliver_code) Traction.Market (0xIsaacNewton), Sencha (jjmatcha) and Venko App (ayyakovenko), rounded out the crown, according to Ian\u2019s blog. He admitted to creating the lot.","Ian, Dylan and the puppet anons promoted Ship Capital\u2019s work incessantly on social media.","They shilled their counterparts\u2019 launches and integrations, praised their brethren's thinkfluencer tweets, credited each other for inspiring them to build on Solana. They even circulated Ian\u2019s self-referential memes.","Sometimes they waxed philosophical. When on Dec. 29 prolific Solana developer Armani Ferrante (a real person) tweeted, \u201CIf you're not making mistakes you're too slow,\u201D five Ian stooges responded in four minutes:","\u201CAs @simplyianm likes to say\u2026 it's an experiment!\u201D declared @_kiwipepper \u2013 \u201Cherself\u201D one of them.","Others danced around the truth. \u201CTeam size =! Success,\u201D Ian tweeted on Dec. 7, 2021. \u201CI would pay @larrinator01 and @0xGoki 10x market rate in a heartbeat. Not that they need my money\u2026\u201D (Ian\u2019s Goki and Larry personas cheered).","Ian\u2019s anons were cheeky when outsiders challenged their legitimacy.","\u201CI\u2019m no puppet,\u201D Surya Khosla asserted on Nov. 25. In early January he joked of \u201Cdoxxing myself\u201D to another developer as a reward for building atop Sunny; Ian\u2019s creation even tweeted a photo that purported to show himself visiting the Macalinao brothers in Los Angeles.","It's impossible to know whether Ian puppeteered his anons\u2019 Twitters after springing them from his workbench. But two people who have worked with Ship Capital recalled the inexplicable behavior of its crew. One persona\u2019s Telegram account would come online after another logged off.","Regardless, Ian admits in the unpublished draft to pulling their strings where it mattered most: the codebases.","\u201CIf you are a developer, it is very easy to find out which open source protocols were written by me: there is always a \u2018flake.nix\u2019 file that only I use.\u201D","CoinDesk verified that many of the projects described in Ian\u2019s blog contained the \u201Cflake.nix\u201D file.","To understand how the \u201Carmy of anons\u201D pumped double-counted value into Saber, 0xGhostchain\u2019s Cashio project offers a compelling view.","Unveiled last November near the crypto market peak, Cashio\u2019s CASH was billed as a \u201Cdecentralized stablecoin\u201D whose dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies were backed by \u201Cliquidity provider\u201D tokens. (LP tokens are a type of crypto asset that holders \u201Cstake\u201D to earn extra yield. DeFi protocols issue them to users whose loaned tokens keep trades moving smoothly.)","Cashio accepted only LP tokens from Saber as collateral. That wasn\u2019t overly strange last November, when Saber, an \u201Cautomated market maker\u201D with over $1 billion in TVL, was a major DeFi trading venue for stablecoin pairs on Solana. (Saber\u2019s current TVL is $90.6 million.)","Cashio relied on Saber ecosystem projects created by Ian\u2019s anons to generate yield.","It first packaged Saber LP tokens into \u201Ctokenized baskets\u201D using Crate, which Ian built under the pseudonym \u201Ckiwipepper.\u201D It sent those \u201Ccrates\u201D through a yield redirection platform called Arrow \u2013 Ian built this as \u201Coliver_code.\u201D Finally, Cashio said it earned yield by staking these deposit derivatives in \u201CSurya\u2019s\u201D Sunny Aggregator as well as Quarry, which Ian built as \u201CLarry Jarry.\u201D Profits flowed to Cashio\u2019s treasury, managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).","Confused? Cashio\u2019s customers were. CoinDesk asked two high-profile users of Cashio to explain the app\u2019s convoluted process; neither could. The app\u2019s \u201Cabout\u201D page didn\u2019t help much, either.","What users cared about was this: Cashio\u2019s DeFi machine accepted their Saber LP tokens and spat out CASH tokens.","It was a lucrative trade. CASH holders could deposit their LP-backed stablecoins into Sunny liquidity pools and earn returns of 10%-30%. Had they deposited Saber LP tokens into Sunny instead of Cashio, they would get just 5%-10%, one trader said. It didn\u2019t matter that the same crypto asset was behind both.","Such is the logic of DeFi money Legos.","Ramming deposits from Saber-to-Cashio-to-Crate-to-Arrow-to-Sunny-or-Quarry had even bigger implications for Saber. According to Ian, it turned $1 of apparent TVL into $6. Many DeFi projects measure their worth by touting total user deposits: TVL.","\u201CTVL can only count if protocols are built separately,\u201D Ian wrote, explaining why his anons\u2019 protocols appeared to be separately built.","According to TVL tracker DeFiLlama, Saber\u2019s deposits peaked at $4.15 billion on Sept. 11 2021; its flagship SBR token had topped out at 90 cents days earlier. Sunny Aggregator\u2019s TVL also peaked on Sept. 11, at $3.4 billion. Its SUNNY token had flirted with an all-time-high of 18 cents one day before.","Both tokens have plummeted 99%, according to data provider CoinGecko. Saber\u2019s and Sunny\u2019s TVL hardly fared better as they have both dropped by over 96%.","Cashio\u2019s March 23 implosion from a $52 million hack was a broadside against Ship Capital.","Ian said in the unpublished blog that he \u201Cpushed very hard for people to stake more into Cashio,\u201D because he wrote its code. He apologized for their \u201Ccatastrophic\u201D losses in a protocol that he created using a pseudonym and endorsed under his true identity.","In the unpublished post, Ian begged the hacker \u2013 a self-styled Robin Hood-type who railed against American and European fat cats \u2013 \u201Cto consider returning the funds.\u201D The hacker later did return $14 million of the $39 million that hack victims requested.","Ian wrote that if the hacker didn\u2019t pay users back in full, \u201CI will do what I can to repay affected personal users in my personal Saber and Sunny tokens. This won\u2019t cover the full amount, but it\u2019s all I have to offer.\u201D He never made good on that unpublished pledge.","Pseudonymity is widespread in crypto, and not in itself evidence of wrongdoing. Thirteen years after bitcoin\u2019s debut, the true identity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains unknown. Yet even after a recent brutal sell-off, the bellwether cryptocurrency boasts a $442 billion market capitalization.","Ian, however, wanted \u201Ca barrier for criticism,\u201D according to the unpublished post:","\u201CI only want to focus on building and creating value in my perception of what I believe is the best way of doing things. I do not want to deal with excessive criticism before my ideas are fully brought to market, and being anonymous is an easy way to distance myself (and the protocols I work on) from this.\u201D","Ian\u2019s arrival in Solanaland in October 2020, according to Discord server logs, was hardly the self-proclaimed \u201Cshipooor\u2019s\u201D first code rodeo. His GitHub commit history stretches back over a decade, with the first public crypto contribution, on an EOS project, in late 2017.","In early January 2021, Ian discussed the tokenomics of what he considered (rightly, it turned out) as a doomed-to-depeg stablecoin in the Discord for Basis.Cash. There, he became \u201Cobsessed\u201D with building decentralized money.","Somewhere along the way, he tried and failed to \u201Cbuild a multiprotocol DeFi ecosystem\u201D that ended \u201Cin criticism and ridicule,\u201D Ian\u2019s post said. \u201CMoving to Solana was a way for me to reset that.\u201D","Read more: UST\u2019s Do Kwon Was Behind Earlier Failed Stablecoin, Ex-Terra Colleagues Say","Who were these anonymous builders flocking to Saber? Ian grappled with the question at last year\u2019s Solana conference in Lisbon, Portugal, during a panel called \u201CFrom Zero to $2 Billion: How Saber Became the Biggest DeFi App on Solana.\u201D","\u201CWe brought in some friends to basically build on top of Saber and just grow out the ecosystem,\u201D Ian told Chris McCann of Race Capital, Saber\u2019s biggest venture capital (VC) backer.","One \u201Cfriend\u2019s\u201D project was Sunny; Crate, the tokenized basket-making protocol from Ian\u2019s alias kiwipepper, was another.","\u201CBut that person also has, like a lot of friends that they know,\u201D Ian told the audience. One of those friends-of-friends built Cashio, a stablecoin project backed by Saber LP tokens that fed liquidity into Sunny Aggregator, he claimed.","\u201CWe could promote [CASH] to get more liquidity into Saber,\u201D he said on stage.","In a brief interview with CoinDesk Thursday, McCann said he was unaware of Ian\u2019s intimate connection to Cashio.","\u201CHe\u2019s always mentioned that there is somebody else that created it, but I do not know who the somebody else is nor have I met them.\u201D","Ian\u2019s unpublished blog reveals Cashio\u2019s true origin. Coding as 0xGhostchain, Ian rushed to complete an exemplar of Saber LP-backed stablecoins in time for Breakpoint, the Solana ecosystem\u2019s biggest-ever gathering of fellow developers. Ian wanted others to copy Cashio, he wrote. Each protocol that parroted its dependence on Saber LP tokens would become a liquidity spigot gushing yet more TVL into the $1.7 billion mothership.","\u201CThis is part of why the code was insecure, it was rushed for this deadline,\u201D he wrote on March 26, after a hacker had spoofed Cashio\u2019s unaudited smart contracts with fake collateral, draining it of $52 million.","Cashio\u2019s Discord community \u2013 where passionate users roam \u2013 likely believed the CASH code was safe. After all, Ian told them on Nov. 23: \u201CI personally audited\u201D it. He pitched a similar yarn to crypto Twitter on March 23, the day of the exploit: \u201CI did not audit Cashio as closely as I should have.\u201D","Both statements contradict what Ian wrote in his unpublished letter:","\u201CI didn\u2019t get anyone else to look at the code, including an auditor. I should not have done this.\u201D","\u201CIt was always the goal to eventually have real people building projects,\u201D Ian wrote in the unpublished blog.","On July 23, the brothers started wooing external developers to Saber with a \u201CDAO accelerator program.\u201D Its application form asks: \u201CHow will your protocol deeply integrate with the Saber Protocol thereby increasing Saber's volume\/TVL\/capital efficiency?\u201D","That effort comes as the brothers cast off from Solana for Aptos, an up-and-coming blockchain \u2013 porting Saber with them.
