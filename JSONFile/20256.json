Now, one of the main questions being discussed is what will happen with Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the exchange, after the Binance.US launch. Moreover, the exchange announced it will block Binance.com users coming from the U.S in 90 days.","\u201CBinance will license its cutting-edge matching engine and wallet technologies to its U.S. partner BAM to launch Binance.US, acknowledged by its recently approved FinCEN [The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network] registration on June 11, 2019,\u201D the exchange said, adding that they\u2019ll share more information \u201Cat a later date.\u201D","Details about BAM Trading Services are scarce. It seems that the company does not have its website while their Twitter account was created in April 2019 and has only one tweet and it\u2019s about their partnership with Binance.","Meanwhile, BNB, which is 7th largest coin by market capitalization, registered the largest drop among the major coins in the past 24 hours as the cryptoverse is discussing how the expansion in the U.S. will affect the coin.
