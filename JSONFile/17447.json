Games that do not receive a GRAC rating cannot be distributed in South Korea.","Per NSPNA, the GRAC stated that the problem was that items accrued by players could be bought, sold and traded on the Ethereum blockchain.","Blockchain consultant Mira Kim told Cryptonews.com,","\u201CMany domestic gaming companies have already put a lot of money into gaming dapps (decentralized apps), anticipating that the government\u2019s position on cryptocurrencies would actually be softening in the future. Honestly, I don\u2019t know where this decision leaves them.\u201D","Other analysts went further. Fn News quotes an unnamed industry insider as stating that the GRAC has effectively \u201Csentenced blockchain gaming to death.\u201D","Although the GRAC admitted it was powerless to stop South Korean users playing blockchain games released by overseas developers, it would appear that the government has all but closed the door to blockchain gaming for the country\u2019s USD 5 billion-a-year gaming industry.","The GRAC responded by stating, \u201CThis decision is not a total ban on games that use blockchain technology.\u201D","But another industry insider, again quoted by Fn, stated,","\u201CIf NFT items are a problem, blockchain gaming\u2019s death warrant has already been signed.\u201D","For its part, NodeBrick says it hopes to appeal the decision, and said, \u201CIt\u2019s a pity that there seems to have bee a misunderstanding about Infinity Star.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Administration Committee (GRAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GRAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mira Kim","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Infinity Star","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NodeBrick","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Gaming","Regulation","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
