She [provided] this information. She was Atlas\u2019 chief financial officer.\u201D","Muller also said the lawmakers should summon Ester Braga, the ex-wife of Rodrigo Marques, the co-founder of Atlas Quantum.","He claimed that Braga was a \u201Cformer high-ranking executive at the company.\u201D ","And he said both Braga and de Almeida Costa \u201Cmay have additional information\u201D that would interest the lawmakers.","Bolsonaro was elected in 2018 and took office the following year.","But when questioned by the MP Dr. Francisco Costa (PT-PI), Muller said that the donations were made \u201Cbetween 2018 and 2019.\u201D","He added that he was not sure the donations had \u201Cbeen officially registered.\u201D","The media outlet noted that Bolsonaro had previously told the nation\u2019s top electoral court he received just under $1 million worth of donations ahead of the 2018 election.","There appears to be no record of a single donor contributing $122,000, O Globo wrote.","Muller went on to accuse law enforcement investigators of failing to investigate Atlas properly, suggesting officers may have been \u201Ccomplicit\u201D in covering for the firm.","But lawmakers challenged Muller, demanding that he produce proof to back up his allegations.","Atlas Quantum was founded in 2018 in São Paulo.","Its founders claimed that an automated trading bot would conduct Bitcoin (BTC) transactions on behalf of investors and \u201Cguarantee\u201D a \u201Cconstant\u201D inflow of profits.","But investors began complaining they were not receiving payouts later in 2018.","A formal investigation was launched the following year.","Lawmakers have since attempted to bring suspected crypto scam operators to justice, in a sweeping investigation that has seen them quiz the likes of football superstar Ronaldinho.","In July, police swooped on the offices of Braiscompany, another notable suspected crypto scam."],"entity":[{"type":"Muller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jair Bolsonaro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ester Braga","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Braga","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Carolina de Almeida Costa","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rodrigo Marques","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bolsonaro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"de Almeida Costa","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"São Paulo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ronaldinho","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Francisco Costa","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Atlas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mateus Muller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$122,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Braiscompany","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Brazil","Scam"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
