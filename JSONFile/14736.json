XRP led the pack among crypto majors with a 10% in the past 24 hours. The gains came amid a technical development announcement that would help developers provide better applications and services to users.","The CoinDesk 20 index (CD20), a liquid index of the twenty biggest tokens minus stablecoins, rose 0.73%.","Spot bitcoin ETFs crossed the $10 billion inflow mark for the first time since going live in January, BitMEX Research noted in a Tuesday post. Some market observers say this could lead to a \u201Csell-side\u201D crisis in the medium term should such flows continue.","\u201CBears can\u2019t win this game until spot bitcoin ETF inflow stops,\u201D said CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju in an X post. \u201CLast week, spot ETFs saw netflows of +30K BTC.

Funding rates are paid by leveraged traders to those on the opposite side of that trade, and the bias toward long or shorts can indicate a bullish or bearish view of the market.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.73%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"QCP Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ki Young Ju","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$71,500","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BitMEX Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Markets","Trading","Investing"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
