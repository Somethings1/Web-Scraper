The firm went on to describe the new Transporter application as a \u201Chyper-secure bridging Aapp\u201D \u2014 explaining it is built on Chainlink CCIP to bring \u201Cunprecedented security\u201D to users wanting to transfer tokens across blockchains.","Transporter allows users to track their assets and messages at every step of the transaction, both on the Transporter app and through the Chainlink CCIP Explorer.","The new application doesn\u2019t charge additional fees, just the regular fees for using CCIP, which cover the gas costs of completing transactions on the destination chain and the fees paid to CCIP service providers.","Chainlink said CCIP entering General Availability has been made possible by the introduction of several new in-demand features, including Transporter.  As well as the addition of token transfer support for USDC.","The firm said CCIP has achieved 900%+ growth in the number of cross-chain transactions and a 4,000%+ growth in cross-chain transfer volume processed by CCIP during Early Access in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This has included multiple transactions of nearly $1 million USDC, showcasing CCIP\u2019s ability to secure large amounts of value over an extended period. "],"entity":[{"type":"4,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"first quarter of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CCIP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chainlins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nazarov","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"General Availability","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"900%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"fourth quarter of 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kroma","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sergey Nazarov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["ChainLink","Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol","developers"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
