The price is due to rise in under four days as the ICO moves to Stage 3.","Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards. ","CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications are also underway, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap.","Make no mistake, the project\u2019s progenitors think Dogeverse has the potential to be a household name as crypto gets more interoperable. ","The #DOGEVERSE sets a new standard for #Crypto #Tokens! 🌟","Buying and #Trading $DOGEVERSE across six major #Blockchains, amplifying Cosmo's vision of a unified crypto verse. 🚀","From #DEXs to #CEXs, join our #Memecoin enthusiasts and explore #Blockchain adventurers worldwide! 🌐 pic.twitter.com\/lYgZszersR","\u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 10, 2024","","Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF) all reference original viral doge memes in some way, but each are circumscribed within their own chain. ","Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin\u2019s code, while the others are either on the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana. ","Dogeverse on a multichain network spanning six chains. It is already live on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, (Ethereum Layer 2) Polygon and Avalanche.

This is because they have a tendency to exaggerate broader market-wide price movements. ","This means, for instance, that on days when investors are feeling risky and pumping Bitcoin, meme coins are often rallying harder. Conversely, a bad risk-off day in crypto may manifest itself in spiraling meme coin prices. ","Investors should be aware then, that meme coin performance is linked to crypto\u2019s perpetual news cycle. In this light, Dogeverse investors have two big boons coming in the next fortnight. ","The first arrives April 19 with the Bitcoin halving. The halving slashes Bitcoin mining rewards in half, effectively choking the issuance of new BTC and helping drive prices higher. Halvings have historically been linked to bull runs.","The second is April 20. Now, certain investors will nod knowingly to the International Pothead Commemoration Day. For this exact reason, the Dogecoin community picked the same day for their own commemoration, to remind them of DOGE\u2019s fun and irreverent origins. ","Coming one day after the halving, Doge Day will be a day of canine coin fun over on social media. However, unlike many of the flash-in-the-pan coins that will pump in the near-future, Dogeverse isn\u2019t just a friend for a day, he\u2019s a friend for life. ","Social Channels: Twitter | Telegram","Buy Dogeverse Here ",""],"entity":[{"type":"$0.000291","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 10, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bonk (BONK)","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$900,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dogeverse","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNB Smart Chain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cosmo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dogeverse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$DOGEVERSE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"International Pothead Commemoration Day","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Dogeverse","Meme Coins","MultiChain"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
