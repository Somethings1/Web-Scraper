He noted that the festival includes a Love and Music Hub, which is designed to bring players together while meeting guest stars.","\u201CFeatured artists and music partners include Warner Music, Steve Aoki, The Notorious B.I.G., Elvis Presley, BLOND:ISH, Sueco, Nuclear Blast Records, and many more,\u201D said Borget.","While The Sandbox hosted a successful interactive dating experience for Valentine\u2019s Day last year, Borget explained that events in the Metaverse enable expression and access in unique ways.","\u201CThe metaverse allows for people to express themselves however they wish to, free from the traditional norms and bounds of the real world,\u201D he remarked.","For instance, Borget pointed out that avatars used in metaverse environments allow players to represent themselves however they wish, both visually and in action. He added that the Metaverse enables access for everyone to participate in festivities without restrictions.","\u201CPeople are able to meet and uniquely interact with others from any location or interest, across a diverse set of experiences not enabled by the real world,\u201D he said.","David Paskett, Head of Content and Community at gaming company Upland, told Cryptonews that he believes personal expression is a central feature of the Metaverse. Therefore, he views Valentine\u2019s Day as an enhanced opportunity for players to showcase their individuality.","\u201CThis Valentine\u2019s Day Upland will offer a range of in-game cosmetics and Block Explorers, allowing users to customize their appearances and interactions within this virtual space,\u201D said Paskett. \u201CThese tools serve not only as a means of personalization, but also as a way for players to engage more deeply with the game\u2019s community and events, particularly during special occasions like Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201D","Paskett added that Upland\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day Block Explorers, which are in-game assets, can be sold as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This creates additional utility and revenue for users during the holiday.","Other Valentine\u2019s Day NFT projects are also coming to fruition as non-fungible tokens gain traction this year.","For example, \u201CHeartsleeves\u201D is a generative-NFT video project that allows individuals who participate to experience an immersive, love-themed video environment. Artists Tali Hinkis and Kyle Lapidus \u2013 also known as \u201CLoVid\u201D \u2013 created the Heartsleeves series presented by Tonic.xyz, which launched on Feb. 8 this year.","\u201CHeartsleeves embraces the theme of human emotions and connection in the age of technology and Web3,\u201D Hinkis said. \u201CRomance and other forms of love are included in this series.\u201D","According to Hinkis, Heartsleeves contains two parts.","\u201CPart 1 is an algorithmically generated abstract video that will play forever without repeating. Ownership of one of these tokens unlocks access to use that generative \u201Cskin\u201D in the portrait studio,\u201D she said. \u201CIn this browser-based studio, participants can step inside this immersive video environment, record, and ultimately mint video portraits.\u201D","Lapidus added that the project leverages decentralized ownership \u2013 one of the main properties of NFTs \u2013 to allow for official portraits to be minted by the Heartsleeves community. \u201CIt invites collectors to become co-creators, celebrating collaboration and connection in our digital world,\u201D he said.","While Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations in the Metaverse may appeal to existing ecosystem participants, the question remains if these experiences will attract the mainstream.","Statistics from Influencer Marketing Hub show that the metaverse global market value could reach $936.6 billion by 2030. Findings also suggest that the metaverse has more than 400 million active users each month.","Given this, Lapidus believes that projects like Heartsleeves will cater to people from various backgrounds.","\u201CThe series includes both a generative video which is mesmerizing to look at and a portrait studio that draws the viewer in that welcomes play and exploration for everyone,\u201D he said.","Metaverse growth will also likely increase with the release of new technologies centered around virtual and augmented reality. For example, Apple\u2019s headset Vision Pro will be incorporating a metaverse app from Victoria VR, which is a company that combines blockchain with virtual reality to ensure real-world experiences.","Borget mentioned that Metaverse platforms should strive to create authentic experiences as an extension of physical cultural moments to attract mainstream consumers.","\u201CWe expect visitors at the Love and Music Festival to be a combination of Web3 enthusiasts alongside the broader gaming community and fans of the featured IPs\/partners who are excited to interact with their favorite brands and celebrities in a unique way,\u201D he said."],"entity":[{"type":"Valentine\u2019s Day Upland","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Warner Music","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"COO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Drive Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Heartsleeves","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"52%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Borget","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Borget","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Valentine\u2019s Day","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lapidus","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Victoria VR","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Influencer Marketing Hub","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2030","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Steve Aoki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Head of Content and Community","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hinkis","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Valentine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Feb. 8 this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 14 until the end of March this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hinkis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"43%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Valentine\u2019s Day NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Heartsleeves","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"The Sandbox","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"51%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Upland\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day Block Explorers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Paskett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sebastien Borget","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Upland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Music Festival","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nuclear Blast Records","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tali Hinkis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kyle Lapidus","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elvis Presley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"David Paskett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$936.6 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Sueco","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Gaming","Metaverse","NFT"],"authors":["Rachel Wolfson"]}
