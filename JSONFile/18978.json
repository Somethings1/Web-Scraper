Within the digital-asset ecosystem, family offices have become more decisive about cryptocurrencies: the proportion that are invested has risen from 16% in 2021 to 26%,\u201D according to Goldman Sachs. ","\u201CHowever, the proportion that is not invested and not interested in the future has risen from 39% to 62% and those that are potentially interested in the future has fallen from 45% to 12%,\u201D the report said.","The surveyed family offices invest in a wide range of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), as well as blockchain-focused funds, as indicated by the latest study. ","\u201CAmong those that do, the most common primary rationale is their belief in the power of blockchain. Within the digital- asset ecosystem, opinions on cryptocurrencies seem to have crystallized since our last survey: a greater proportion of family offices are now invested in cryptocurrencies \u2014 26% versus 16% in 2021,\u201D the report said. ","At the same time, 62% of the surveyed family offices declare that they are not invested in the sector and are not interested in investing in the future, compared with 39% in 2021. Only 12% indicated potential future interest, a solid decrease from 45% in 2021, according to the investment bank. ","\u201COpinions on cryptocurrencies seem to have crystallized: a greater proportion of family offices are now invested in cryptocurrencies, but the proportion that are not invested and not interested in investing in the future has grown more,\u201D Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysts concluded in the report. "],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"32%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"45%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"62%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"26%","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["Goldman Sachs"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
