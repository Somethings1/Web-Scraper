The regulator wants to boost public awareness of common crypto scams.","On April 29, the FSS announced plans to publish a \u201Ccasebook\u201D of case studies and \u201Ctips.\u201D The regular said it hopes this will help citizens identify and avoid crypto-related fraud.","The FSS said that the casebook contained an analysis of 2,209 reports of crypto-related phishing attacks logged from January to April.","The regulator said that the reports had been processed by the nation\u2019s Virtual Asset-related Investment Fraud Reporting Center.","The data shows that chat app-based crypto \u201Creading rooms\u201D have become a hotbed of crypto phishing schemes.","Almost 27 of all the 2,209 reports originated from these open channels, ostensibly set up as knowledge-sharing resources for South Korean crypto enthusiasts.","Police have shut down multiple rings operating \u201Creading rooms\u201D-type scams in recent years.","Some 19% of the cases, meanwhile, were related to \u201Cunregistered\u201D or bogus crypto exchanges.","The regulator explained that it had identified seven overarching themes in the most recent phishing report, namely:","South Korea is at the heart of the global cryptocurrency resurgence, and one exchange dominates the local market https:\/\/t.co\/CS4c7Z9moU","\u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) April 30, 2024","","The regulator\u2019s case studies include the story of a citizen who received an Instagram direct message from an individual claiming to be a pilot based in the United States.","After developing a \u201Cromantic relationship,\u201D the \u201Cpilot\u201D said that they had earned a considerable amount of money by investing in crypto.","The \u201Cpilot\u201D would regularly send the victim photos of luxury goods supposedly bought with these crypto trading profits.","The victim then agreed to \u201Cinvest\u201D a small amount of money, which accrued a modest \u201Cprofit.\u201D","Then the victim agreed to take out a bank loan worth around $217,000. They then used this money to buy cryptoassets.","The \u201Cpilot\u201D instructed the victim to send the coins to a \u201Ccrypto exchange,\u201D which turned out to be bogus.","When the victim tried to \u201Cwithdraw\u201D the coins from the \u201Cexchange,\u201D they realized that they had been duped.","The FSS said that it would publish the casebook on its website and would also provide printouts to \u201Cthe financially vulnerable\u201D at senior welfare centers.","The regulator said that groups \u201Csuch as the elderly\u201D were particularly at risk. Government bodies have issued similar warnings in Japan.","FSS spokespeople said they would also distribute the casebook at employment support centers and metropolitan local government centers \u201Cacross the country.\u201D An official said:","\u201CIf you suspect that you have fallen victim to an investment fraud similar to the case listed in the casebook, please report this to the FSS immediately. Alternatively, please contact the police and request assistance.\u201D","The media outlet noted that the FSS was working on the project with the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA).","DAXA comprises the exchanges Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, all of which have permits to offer KRW trading in South Korea.","And DAXA said it plans to post the casebook and educational videos on phishing protection on its members\u2019 social media channels.","Late last year, the body said it would work with financial regulators to hunt down \u201Cundeclared crypto operators.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Bloomberg Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Coinone","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Korbit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DAXA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FSS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bithumb","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$217,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"KRW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the Financial Supervisory Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 30, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Namdo Ilbo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["crypto phishing","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
