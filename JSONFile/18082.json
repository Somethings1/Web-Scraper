This change is marked by growing interest from institutional investors, renewed optimism, and wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.","\u201CCustody has always been integral to the institutional crypto space and the recent success of the bitcoin ETFs has only underscored the need for a broader range of qualified custodians,\u201D said Tim Ogilvie, Head of Kraken Institutional. ","He pointed out that Kraken Custody\u2019s launch is \u201Cwell-timed,\u201D offering another option for custody.","Kraken Custody is the first product under our new institutional brand.
