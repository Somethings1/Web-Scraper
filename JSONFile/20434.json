However, while margin trading enables traders to amplify their returns, it can also lead to increased losses and liquidations, which is why experienced traders tend to advise newcomers to stay away from leveraged trading.","The average leverage used on FTX is some 2x. \u201CAnd while we think that many of the arguments are high leverage miss the mark, we also don\u2019t think it\u2019s an important part of the crypto ecosystem, and in some cases it\u2019s not a healthy part of it.\u201D","Therefore, claims the CEO, removing high leverage (more than 20 times) is a step in the direction the industry has been headed for a while.","\u201CAgain, this will hit a tiny fraction of activity on the platform, and while many users have expressed that they like having the option, very few use it. And it\u2019s time, we think, to move on from it,\u201D he added.","The risky trades offered on FTX, Binance, BitMEX and other exchanges are often blamed for accelerating a market downturn in May.","Clara Medalie, the research lead at Kaiko, a cryptocurrency market data provider in Paris, told The New York Times that \u201Cthese liquidations are obviously a huge factor in the price crash,\u201D and that \u201Cit is a vicious cycle.\u201D","The price crash automatically prompted the exchanges to liquidate trading positions of the most highly leveraged investors \u2013 before their collateral became insufficient to cover their positions.","The high-leverage offerings on FTX are more of a reputational liability as Bankman-Fried looks to expand FTX\u2019s global reach, said Timothy Massad, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.","And another exchange is apparently reacting to the recent regulatory developments. Major crypto exchange Binance said that its futures already started limiting new users to maximum 20 times leverage.","Per the CEO Changpeng Zhao, the move was made on July 19, but the team \u201Cdidn\u2019t want to make this a thingy.\u201D","\u201CIn the interest of Consumer Protection, we will apply this to existing users progressively over the next few weeks,\u201D said Zhao.","Having previously offered a maximum of 125 times, an investment of USD 1,000 could be turned into a bet of as much as USD 125,000 on Binance.","All this, and likely more, is coming as the regulatory pressure from around the world, and particularly the US as of late, is increasing on the fast-developing crypto industry. Binance alone, for example, has been facing regulatory issues in a number of countries.","\u201CIt\u2019s clear that heavy regulations should be expected. Binance is in the mindset of shifting from a tech startup to a financial service. We are increasing compliance efforts, including ex-regulators,\u201D Zhao said during the virtual summit REDeFiNE TOMORROW 2021.","Today, Binance Margin said it will delist AUD, EUR, and GBP cross and isolated margin pairs in August.","These two centralized exchanges are not the only ones that seem to be doing some pre-emptive regulation.","The software development studio behind major decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI), Uniswap Labs, has restricted access to a number of tokens on an open-source interface that it supports, app.uniswap.org \u2013 \u201Cconsistent with actions taken by other DeFi interfaces,\u201D they said.","The list includes derivatives and tokenized stocks. The listed coins \u201Chave always represented a very small portion of overall volume\u201D on Uniswap, the team argued.","\u201CTo continue to innovate and provide this tool for the Uniswap community, we monitor the evolving regulatory landscape,\u201D they said.","Notably, Uniswap is restricting access through its own interface only, adding that \u201Cthis action has no impact on the Uniswap Interface code, which remains open-source, or the many other portals or locally-run instances used to access the Uniswap Protocol.\u201D","Last Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler suggested that stock tokens would have to be registered, be they on centralized or decentralized platforms. \u201CIf these products are security-based swaps, the other rules I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, such as the trade reporting rules, will apply to them,\u201D he added, noting that the SEC has already brought some cases involving retail offerings of security-based swaps and \u201Cunfortunately, there may be more.\u201D","Last week, Binance also announced that stock tokens are already unavailable for purchase on Binance.com, and this platform will no longer support any such tokens as the platform shifts its \u201Ccommercial focus to other product offerings.\u201D","Meanwhile, some crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini have already been focusing on compliance more, trying to avoid grey regulatory areas and turning it into their competitive advantage.","\u201CWe\u2019re playing the long game,\u201D Gemini\u2019s Cameron Winklevoss recently told Bloomberg. \u201CWe\u2019re trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race. The long game pays off over time.\u201D","Gemini\u2019s parent, Gemini Trust Co., also helped create the Virtual Commodity Association the goal of which is to prevent fraud and manipulation, and which is \u201Creminiscent of the self-regulatory groups set up by Wall Street.\u201D","Meanwhile, Coinbase published audited financials and \u201Cbeefed up\u201D its compliance operations as it listed shares this year, while Kraken got a regulated bank charter in Wyoming as it prepares to go public as well.","\u201CThe Catch-22 is that the crypto system was set up to avoid big banks,\u201D John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s McCombs School of Business was quoted as saying. Griffin added that \u201Crather than having this autonomous universe free of government regulation, we have crypto exchanges playing the role that traditional exchanges and governments play in traditional markets.\u201D\n___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Bitcoin Shows Resilience Amid Global Political Pushback\n\u2013 EU Regulation May Harm Small Crypto Players, Stablecoin Users, And Elon Musk","\u2013 SEC to Provide Clarity on Token Distribution, Crypto-Based ETPs \u2013 Hester Peirce\n\u2013 S Korean Regulator to Force Crypto Overseas Exchanges to Abide by its Rules","\u2013 BlockFi Fights Regulatory Fire in 3 US States; Reportedly Wants to Go Public\n\u2013 European Commission Clarifies What It Means By \u2018Anonymous Crypto Wallets\u2019","\u2013 SEC Coinschedule Settlement Opens up Old Crypto Securities Wounds\n\u2013 Japanese Regulator Report Suggests DeFi Regulations Could Be Coming","\u2013 UK Watchdog Set to (Re)Target \u2018Misleading\u2019 Crypto Investment Marketing\n\u2013 This Is Why Robinhood Doesn\u2019t Allow You to Withdraw Bitcoin, DOGE & Co."],"entity":[{"type":"a percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Force Crypto Overseas Exchanges","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EUR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Clara Medalie","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kaiko","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Withdraw Bitcoin, DOGE & Co","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Uniswap Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK Watchdog Set","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Virtual Commodity Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Griffin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Timothy Massad","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Token Distribution","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini Trust Co.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Stablecoin Users","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John Griffin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Investment Marketing","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Uniswap Interface","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC Coinschedule Settlement Opens up Old Crypto Securities Wounds","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cameron Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Consumer Protection","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Paris","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hester Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Uniswap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wyoming","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Austin\u2019s McCombs School of Business","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"University of Texas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance Margin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The New York Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Shows Resilience Amid Global Political Pushback\n\u2013 EU Regulation May Harm Small Crypto Players","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Bitcoin","Coinbase","Cryptocurrency","Decentralized Exchange","Derivatives","FTX","Gemini","Kraken","Regulation","Trading","Uniswap"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
