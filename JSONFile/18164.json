The filing noted that investment products within the privacy-preserving protocol category must offer publicly traded securities in the US.","Furthermore, firms considered for inclusion must be publicly traded on either US, non-US developed markets, or emerging market stock exchanges. They also need to possess a market capitalization of at least $250m and fulfill specific liquidity criteria, the filing indicated.","Grayscale\u2019s filing is significant as it is among the most prominent cryptoasset management firms, with an estimated $27b in assets under management as of Jan. 2024. It is also seen as a trailblazer in helping facilitate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.","Last year, Grayscale won approval to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF, leading to the establishment of the world\u2019s largest bitcoin ETF.
