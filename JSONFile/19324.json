Leandro Schlottchauer, co-founder of Kuyen Labs, stated that it might be one of the last \u201Clife-changing airdrops.\u201D","Conversely, many EigenLayer users have criticized the airdrop for its ban on VPN servers, the distribution of nontransferable tokens, and its perceived short snapshot period.","As airdrop season rages on, LayerZero Labs, a renowned cross-chain interoperability protocol, has vowed to tackle the issue of sybil farmers ahead of its highly anticipated airdrop.","The project has stated that it will conduct an internal investigation to identify and exclude sybil farmers from receiving allocations in its future token generation event.","Additionally, the project plans to launch a reward program, offering a 10% bonus of the intended token allocation to bounty hunters who identify additional sybil users.","LayerZero Labs recently completed the first snapshot for its highly anticipated airdrop.","In December, the project announced its plans to distribute tokens to early adopters in the first half of 2024."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Season 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the first half of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"LayerZero Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Leandro Schlottchauer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Pendle","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EIGEN","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Equilibrium","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"VPN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"6.05%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kuyen Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Ethereum staking"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
