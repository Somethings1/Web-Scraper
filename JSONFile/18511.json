Per Bitfinex:","\u201CThis movement of older Bitcoin supply is an important indicator of market behavior, especially among long-term holders. It reflects the changing sentiment and strategies of these investors, who are most likely responding to market developments like the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs or reassessing their positions in light of current market conditions.\u201D","The Value Days Destroyed (VDD) metric is used to project when Bitcoin\u2019s price has heightened in bull cycles and is calculated by multiplying the asset\u2019s price by the Coin Days Destroyed value.","At the moment, there is an increase in VVD, indicating that some investors are offloading their assets. Historically, VVD highs precede price peaks almost similar to the bear market sell-offs.","However, the liveliness metric remains at multi-year lows, showing that certain holders will keep their assets to make a higher profit since the price plunged immediately after the spot Bitcoin approvals.","\u201CThis suggests that a significant majority of the Bitcoin supply continues to be tightly held. The reasons for this could vary: holders may be waiting for higher spot prices before they decide to sell, or they might be looking for increased market volatility as a catalyst for spending their coins.\u201D","The upcoming halving is another factor causing recent Bitcoin price movements.","Miners introducing their Bitcoin reserves to exchanges indicates an inclination to sell off leverage assets to improve capacity and efficiency ahead of the halving."],"entity":[{"type":"Jan 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$46k","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin (BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitfinex Alpha","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"VVD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","ETF","Supply"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
