We\u2019re just really trying to accelerate the advance of sustainable energy.\u201D","\u201CIt\u2019s interesting, I have some friends that are really bold in crypto,\u201D Musk said, partly referring to Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey who recently said that he believes bitcoin may become \u201Cthe native currency of the Internet.\u201D","However, Musk also touched on what he views as the downsides of crypto, saying that \u201Ccomputationally it is quite energy intensive.\u201D","\u201CThere have to be some kind of constraints on the creation of crypto. But it\u2019s very energy intensive to create the incremental bitcoin at this point,\u201D Musk said in the interview.","In the wide-ranging interview, Musk also discussed the possibilities that exist for crypto to revolutionize financial transactions in Africa. Here, business-to-business transactions across borders remains \u201Cprohibitively expensive\u201D because of the difficulties with converting one African currency to another, according to the show hosts.","To this point, Musk agreed, saying that \u201Cit bypasses currency controls,\u201D before he added that \u201Cpaper money is going away, and crypto is a far better way to transfer value than pieces of paper, that\u2019s for sure.\u201D","In the past, Elon Musk has frequently been impersonated by scammers on Twitter involving cryptocurrency. When asked early last year where all the spam comes from, Musk responded \u201CNot sure. I let @jack (Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey) know, but it\u2019s still going. I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago.\u201D","Bitcoin price chart:",""],"entity":[{"type":"SpaceX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency","Elon Musk"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
