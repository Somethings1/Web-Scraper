But as Japanese law requires that all new token listings gain approval from the nation\u2019s top financial regulator, Line was forced to wait until this month to finally list its token on the Bitmax exchange.","Line marked its listing with a number of promotional offers, including free link token giveaways for customers making deposits or purchases in a number of leading cryptoassets, including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH).","As previously reported\n, the firm \u2013 which was founded by South Korean internet giant Naver \u2013 is set to merge with the Softbank-backedYahoo Japan in February next year. The latter is also a major crypto play, with multiple crypto exchange interests \u2013 and could spark the creation of Asia\u2019s first crypto mega-company.","Line also operates Bitfront (formerly Bitbox), crypto exchanges based in other Asian nations such as Singapore.","Per media outlet Coin Post, Line is also set to launch a dapp developing kit for its blockchain network. The move will allow partner firms to create and release decentralized apps compatible with its crypto wallet and exchange platforms."],"entity":[{"type":"100 million yen","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Naver","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hedge Guide","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Softbank","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Japan"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
