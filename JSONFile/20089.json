The Bitcoin ETF is mostly comprised of long-term BTC holders with a lower cost base, unlike fresher competitors whose earliest buyers arrived this January.","\u201CThat we know GBTC was 1\/3rd of it doesn\u2019t alter the cyclical footprint,\u201D TXMC explained. \u201CThe hodler cohort is typically in accumulation at all times except parabolic bull runs.\u201D","Historical data shows that long-term holder supply has steadily increased throughout Bitcoin\u2019s history.
