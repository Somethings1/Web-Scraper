Although there was some rotation into ETH after the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, the momentum was arrested by liquidations from a large defunct crypto lender alongside pressure from the sale of ETH options.\u201D","The anticipation of growth largely banks on the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, mirroring the market acceptance Bitcoin has enjoyed. Such a move could open up new windows of opportunity for Ethereum.","","ETH gained over 80% in 2023 and recorded increasing DeFi numbers and institutional fund investment despite playing second fiddle to Bitcoin\u2019s soaring ETF narratives.","Bitcoin led the pack with over 158% gains in 2023 as institutional funds trickled in from BlackRock\u2019s ETF application wiping out losses from the horrid crypto winter in 2022.","Ethereum\u2019s growth on the institutional front was also overshadowed by Solana (SOL) which recorded a string of inflows into investment funds earning the description as an institutional investor favorite.","This year, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has seen flows into the market leader and altcoins but the momentum of Ethereum is still below the mark projected by most analysts.","Last year, a group of wealth managers projected Ether as having the highest growth potential among top crypto assets despite figures at the time.","The firms looked at the activities around decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum Network and their performance during a bull run to make their predictions.","Additionally, the staking mechanism on the blockchain after it transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (POS) model can attract new users who want to earn staking rewards.","Similarly, a publication by Grayscale noted the underperformance of Ethereum in 2023 as its smart contract growth was relatively more than other networks along with other metrics.","\u201CEther produced strong returns in 2023 but underperformed Bitcoin as well as certain other smart contract blockchain tokens. We think this reflects Bitcoin-specific positives this year and a slower recovery in Ethereum\u2019s on-chain activity.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"158%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana (SOL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","ETF","Ethereum"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
