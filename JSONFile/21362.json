I wrote about why in my latest CIO Memo: https:\/\/t.co\/8WrNV5SXtj pic.twitter.com\/GJC8PEXZkQ","\u2014 Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) May 14, 2024","","A 13F filing is a form required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of all investors with $100 million in assets under management, disclosing their entire ownership of publicly traded securities. Thousands of investors have now filed their Q1 2024 reports \u2013 the first reporting period during which Bitcoin spot ETFs have been live.","\u201CA lot of professional investors own bitcoin ETFs.\u201D Hougan wrote, taking note of iconic asset managers like Hightower Advisors, which owns $68 million in the new funds. Another includes Bracebridge Capital, a Boston-based hedge fund holding a much larger $434 million in Bitcoin.","Based on all filings submitted by May 9, a total of 563 professional investment firms were identified as having bought the ETFs, with allocations worth $3.5 billion in total. That doesn\u2019t include those filing between then and May 15, such as the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), which reported a $162 million allocation to Bitcoin on Tuesday.","According to Hougan, it\u2019s very uncommon for ETFs to attract so many 13F filers in their first few months live. \u201CFrom a breadth of ownership perspective, the bitcoin ETFs are a historic success,\u201D he wrote.","But that doesn\u2019t mean Bitcoin ETF buyers have dried up already. Based on the data, it seems the vast majority of buyers until now have been retail-based, with professional investors only starting to dip their toes in.","\u201CMost professional investors take 6-12 months to evaluate crypto,\u201D Hougan said, noting that allocations to crypto after one client meeting are \u201Cextremely rare.\u201D","Next, those investors usually make personal allocations to test the water, before making isolated allocations on behalf of their more pro-crypto clients later on.","Finally, after about 6 months, those firms will start making \u201Cplatform-wide allocations\u201D with their whole client book, comprising 1% to 5% of their entire portfolio. For context, current allocations made by investors like HighTower comprise just 0.05% of their portfolios.","\u201CA 1% allocation of their portfolio to bitcoin would equate to $1.2 billion\u2014all from a single firm,\u201D Hougan wrote. \u201CMultiply that by the growing number of professional investors participating in the space, and you can begin to see what\u2019s behind my enthusiasm.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"Bitwise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$434 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hightower Advisors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$162 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"HighTower","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$68 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.05%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$3.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Matt Hougan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bracebridge Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12 months","content":"DATE"},{"type":"State of Wisconsin Investment Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Boston","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hougan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Hougan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Bitwise"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
