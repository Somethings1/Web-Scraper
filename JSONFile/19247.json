Today\u2019s filing reinforces the CFTC\u2019s long-standing commitment to hold accountable those who take advantage of victims,\u201D he added."],"entity":[{"type":"Amanda Griffis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CFTC Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"God Thru Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tennessee","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Clarksville","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CEA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"July 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$6M","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["CFTC","Crime"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
