Specifically, the BMC estimated that the mining efficiency would increase by a factor of 3x and 2x over the next four and following four years, respectively.","Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the UK-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in an emailed comment that,","\u201CThese improvements are appealing for institutions who see environmental impact as one of the biggest reasons not to invest in Bitcoin.\u201D ","It is worth noting that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claimed that he would once again start accepting BTC payments for vehicle purchases when Bitcoin\u2019s percentage of renewable energy usage surpasses 50%.","@elonmusk are you getting ready?https:\/\/t.co\/YgkkMFnpH9","Musk is not involved in the BMC. Per the council\u2019s website, the outspoken billionaire has no role in it, and \u201Cthe extent of his involvement was joining an educational call with a group of North American companies to discuss Bitcoin mining.\u201D ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits ATH as \u2018Tectonic Shifts\u2019 Bring \u2018New Opportunities\u2019\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining in 2022: New Locations, Technologies, and Bigger Players\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining CO2 Footprint Is Below 0.08% Of Global Total\n\u2013 \u2018Bitcoin Is Being Embraced\u2019 by the Government & Regulatory Future Is \u2018Bright\u2019 \u2013 MicroStrategy\u2019s Saylor\n\n\u2013 American Bitcoin Miner Aims to Sell USD 30M Equipment in Russia to Avoid Sanctions\n\u2013 \u2018PoS Fanatics Attacking PoW are Actual Supervillains\u2019, Kraken\u2019s Powell Says as US Politicians Charge"],"entity":[{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Government & Regulatory Future","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BMC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Marcus Sotiriou","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy\u2019s Saylor\n\n\u2013 American Bitcoin Miner Aims to Sell USD 30M Equipment","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits ATH","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"64.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.085%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"the first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin & Crypto Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"63%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"the first quarter of 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SpaceX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Data Review\u2019","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"58.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BMC","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"0.08%","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ecology","Michael Saylor","Mining"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
