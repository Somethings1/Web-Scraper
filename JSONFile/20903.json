Out of the four exchanges, only the Meex Digital Securities Limited application was rejected by the SFC. ","The other three withdrew their applications.","It is worth noting that there have been concerns about the strict requirements for the registration process, which could potentially hamper the market\u2019s competitiveness.","While Hong Kong allows crypto firms to tap into developer talent in mainland China, the high costs associated with the licensing process differentiate it from Singapore.","Estimates suggest that the entire process, including external assessors and hiring a local responsible officer (RO), could cost over HK$60 million (US$7.7 million).","Angela Ang, a former regulator with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, told SCMP that the lower number of applicants in Hong Kong can be attributed to the stringent requirements. ","Furthermore, there is concern that Hong Kong\u2019s regulations may limit the global competitiveness of crypto companies using the city as a base of operations. ","The current framework restricts the scope of activities and services that can be offered to customers, potentially hindering their ability to operate globally.","Hong Kong also aims to regulate tokenized securities and stablecoins as part of its broader Web3 push, while the monetary authority explores the concept of a digital Hong Kong dollar.","In comparison, when Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority gave crypto companies one month to notify their pre-existing status and intention to be licensed in 2021, it resulted in about 70 official license applications by the end of 2021, three times the number in Hong Kong."," "],"entity":[{"type":"Meex Digital Securities Limited","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 1, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"OSL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Angela Ang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South China Morning Post","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"HK$60 million (US$7.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monetary Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SCMP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Exchange","Hong Kong","Licence"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
