I think that\u2019s what\u2019s healthy for the ecosystem, and I want to do what can help it grow and thrive.\u201D","The CEO did not specify how they \u201Cstepped in\u201D during this crash if at all, and just provided an example from 2021. Last year, when hackers targeted Japanese crypto exchange Liquid and stole close to USD 100m worth of crypto, FTX came to the company\u2019s rescue with USD 120m in financing, and shortly afterward unveiled plans to acquire Liquid.","\u201CWe, I think about 24 hours later, stepped in and gave them a pretty broad line of credit to be able to cover all of their demands, to make sure customers were made whole, while thinking about the longer-term solution,\u201D he said.","In contrast with the policy adopted by some of its major rivals, such as Coinbase, FTX says it is not going to slow down hiring new employees despite the adverse market conditions. The company finds that it significantly scaled its revenues and productivity during bullish times and is pursuing its hiring plans irrespectively of the industry\u2019s general performance, according to Bankman-Fried.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 FTX to Enter Japan via Liquid Group Acquisition as Altcoin Listing Rules May Ease\n\u2013 Liquid Exchange Hacked, Working With Other Exchanges on Recovering Funds\n\n\u2013 Not Enough Liquidity for Celsius to Sell Staked Ethereum in Open Market \u2013 Analyst\n\u2013 Canada\u2019s Bitvo Acquired by FTX\n\n\u2013 FTX Overtook Coinbase & OKX in May,\n\u2013 \u2018Strongly Profitable\u2019 FTX Will Keep Hiring Despite Bearish Market \u2013 CEO"],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FTX Overtook Coinbase & OKX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Federal Reserve (Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NPR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Enter Japan via Liquid Group Acquisition","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Federal Reserve","FTX","Market","Sam Bankman-Fried","USA"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
