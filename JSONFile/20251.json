After Dencun lands, many of the network\u2019s retail users will ultimately get funnelled onto layer 2s, lured by the cheaper fees.","Starknet operates as a layer 2, providing scale and Ethereum-level security by producing STARK proofs off-chain, and then sending those proofs on-chain.","\u201CAs Dencun kicks in on Ethereum, Starknet users can celebrate that they will be feeling a double set of fee savings,\u201D said Diego Oliva, CEO of the Starknet Foundation, in a press release.","\u201CMore than users on any other L2 [layer two] they are expected to see Dencun directly cut fees. This is because Starknet fees have the highest proportion of data availability costs, where the savings are being made,\u201D said Oliva.","Starknet said it is ready to get the most out of Ethereum\u2019s 4844hard fork through its own special Dencun-dedicated upgrade dubbed, \u201CStarknet version, 0.13.1.\u201D","The upgrade for this version started on Tuesday.Â Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade includes EIP-4844 or \u201Cproto-danksharding,\u201D a key enhancement that introduces \u201Cblobs\u201D\u2014a cheaper transaction type, reducing overall costs on the Ethereum network.","Starknet said with the new update to Starknet 0.13.1, the network will transition from using the expensive \u2018calldata\u2019 method for sending data to Ethereum to the more cost-effective \u2018blobs\u2019 transaction type, significantly reducing fees.","Calldata currently accounts for 85% to 90% of the gas fees that Starknet pays to post transactions.
