This block included 3,050 transactions, resulting in an average fee of nearly $800 per user.","The demand for block 840,000 was largely driven by enthusiasts of meme coins and NFTs competing to inscribe and etch rare satoshis using the Runes protocol."],"entity":[{"type":"$128","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$78.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$10","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 21","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dashjr","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$8","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CTO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Luke Dashjr","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin miner ViaBTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Blockchain","Bitcoin ordinals","Runes Protocol"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
