However, per blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, the total value of the stolen cryptoassets at the time of the theft was USD 540m, which makes it the second-largest crypto theft."," ","Both the bridge and the Katana decentralized exchange have been halted, they added.","The team behind the network claims that today, they discovered that Sky Mavis\u2019s Ronin validator nodes and Axie DAO validator nodes were compromised on March 23. Sky Mavis is the developer of Axie Infinity, the popular blockchain-powered play-to-earn game. The firm also developed Ronin, an Ethereum-linked sidechain made specifically for Axie Infinity.","\u201CThe attacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals. We discovered the attack this morning after a report from a user being unable to withdraw 5k ETH from the bridge,\u201D they said.","The team said they are working with law enforcement officials, forensic cryptographers, \u201Cand our investors to make sure all funds are recovered or reimbursed.\u201D","\u201CAll of the AXS, RON, and SLP on Ronin are safe right now,\u201D they added.","According to them, their users are now unable to withdraw or deposit funds to Ronin Network.","\u201CSky Mavis is committed to ensuring that all of the drained funds are recovered or reimbursed,\u201D the team added. \n\nAt 18:44 UTC, AXS trades at USD 65 and is down almost 9% in a day, SLP dropped 11% to USD 0.02, while RON crashed 20%, reaching USD 1.84.","Elliptic said that its internal analysis indicates that the exploiter has already begun laundering their proceeds, with funds originating from the attack already reaching at least \u201Cthree prominent crypto exchanges.\u201D The exploiter is using both centralized and decentralized exchanges, they added.","\u201CAt the time of writing, around USD 16 million in ETH has been laundered in this manner, leaving USD 524 million in various Ethereum accounts which appear to belong to the attacker,\u201D the firm said.\n___\n ","You cannot make this up\n\nHacker steals $600MM in ETH from Ronin blockchain the one underlying Axie\n\nHacker then goes short Ronin & AXS (Axie token) knowing as soon as news breaks that tokens will plummet\n\nBut NO ONE notices and they get liquidated on short before news breaks","This is very different from previous bridge hacks where the root cause was a smart contract bug. This is a much more \"classical\" hack of private keys in a multi-key security setup. This is why trust-minimized bridging is SO important.","Anyone remember the Binance hack in May 2019 and the price action around that?\n\nPay attention to ETH right here. Ronin sidechain just got smoked for $600mm of ETH. If ETH can't dump, tells you everything you need to know.","17 to me, the point is that a lot of innocent folks including people playing-to-earn from low income families will be hurt by this incident.","3 This was about bridging validators, so the attack was in that respect similar to the Wormhole hack. Again, Vitalik warned us. All chains experience all other chains as off-chain.","\n \n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Crypto Security in 2022: Prepare for More DeFi Hacks, Exchange Outages, and Noob Mistakes \n\u2013 Digital Collectibles Marketplace VeVe Loses \u2018Large Amount of Gems\u2019 in an Exploit\n\n\u2013 ApeCoin Smart Contract Exploited, \u2018Well-Prepared Claimer\u2019 Walks Away With USD 380K\n\u2013 DeFiance Founder\u2019s USD 1.76M Loss is a Lesson For NFT Investors\n\u2013 Poly Network Hacker Keeps Sending Funds Back, Returns USD 342M","\u2013 BlockFi, Swan Bitcoin, Pantera Advise Users How to Stay Safe After Data Got Hacked in Hubspot CRM Raid\n\u2013 IRA Financial Trust Hack Reportedly Sees USD 36M in Crypto Stolen From Users\n\n\u2013 The 4th Largest Crypto Theft Shows DeFi Weakness as Hacker Nets USD 325M in a Wormhole\n\u2013 What Did We Learn from the MonoX Hack?\n\n___\n(Updated at 19:18 UTC with additional details and comments.
