It\u2019s not, \u2018a rising tide lifts all boats.\u2019 It\u2019s, \u2018burn the boats\u2019,\u201D Insider reminded readers."],"entity":[{"type":"Charles Schwab","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Citadel Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Valkyrie Funds","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nic Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Blackrock","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Blackrock","ETF"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
