Conifex Timber wanted the policy declared invalid.","The court upheld the government\u2019s right, stating that the move was \u201Creasonable\u201D and not \u201Cunduly discriminatory.\u201D","On Monday, Conifex Timber said that it\u2019s \u201Cdisappointed\u201D with the court\u2019s ruling and is considering an appeal.","The statement said that \u201CConifex continues to believe that the provincial government is missing out on several opportunities available to it to improve energy affordability, accelerate technological innovation, strengthen the reliability and resiliency of the power distribution grid in British Columbia, and achieve more inclusive economic growth.\u201D","Before the provincial government paused new power connections, BC Hydro released a report. It claimed that power demand from crypto mining operations would challenge clean energy and electrification goals.","The court ruling said connection requests over the last few years from cryptocurrency miners in B.C. \u201Cfar exceeded\u201D BC Hydro\u2019s projections.","It added that the pause was in response to \u201Cthe very real prospect that devoting such a large proportion of the available electrical power supply to one industry would leave less energy for other uses which might result in increased costs to all other residential and industry customers in B.C.\u201D","Swiss-based Web3 fintech platform YouHodler has obtained its Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration from the Bank of Spain.","According to the press release, YouHodler can now provide its suite of Web3 financial services to individual and enterprise users in Spain. It is in full compliance with the nation\u2019s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations.","The completion of this VASP registration, it said, \u201Ccomplements the company\u2019s existing authorizations and licenses across the EU, particularly before the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation takes effect.\u201D","YouHodler\u2019s suite of Web3 fintech services is available in more than 60 countries, the firm said. It is designed to enable a seamless connection between fiat and crypto financial services.","The platform offers a tool that helps investors capitalize on market volatility. It further offers instant credit cards, bank withdrawals, and support for more than 50 coins as collateral.","This is in addition to its enterprise solutions, it said. These enable companies like cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallets, and retail digital payment providers to expand their offerings with the support of YouHodler\u2019s technology.","USDT issuer Tether has announced its investment in the mobile payment application Oobit.","Per the press release, the Series A funding round has concluded with $25 million raised. It will be used to support its goal of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.","The round was led by Tether\u2019s investment arm, with participation from CMCC Global\u2019s Titan Fund, 468 Capital, and Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, among others.","Oobit\u2019s mobile payment app enables crypto holders to Tap & Pay at over 100 million retailers worldwide, accepting Visa and Mastercard.
