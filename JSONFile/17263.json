I think in the long-term, transactions may be even more serious than minting in this regard, but I will for the moment discuss minting because it is more precisely bounded and defined. The idea that the value of bitcoins is in some way related to the value of the electricity required, on average, to mint a winning block is generally accepted, but the precise nature of this relationship is contentious.\u201D","And after some back and forth with other site contributors, Nakomoto made a rare appearance in the chat to explain that the \u201Csituation\u201D was not unlike gold and its relation with gold mining.","Nakomoto wrote,","\u201CThe marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin. The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste.\u201D","And Nakomoto went on to defend Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work model. However, Gridecoin disagreed with the idea that the very high computational burden of coin generation is in fact a necessity of the current system:","\u201CAs I understand it, currency creation is fundamentally metered by time \u2013 and if that is the fundamental controlling variable, what is the need for everyone to \u2018roll as many dice as possible\u2019 within that given time period? The \u2018chain of proof\u2019 for coin ownership and transactions doesn\u2019t depend on the method for spawning coins.\u201D","But the BTC founder responded that \u201CProof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen. We don\u2019t have to worry about a chain of custody of communication. It doesn\u2019t matter who tells you a longest chain, the proof-of-work speaks for itself.\u201D","And that drew a positive response from Gridecoin, who wrote,","\u201CI agree with your analysis, and this thread has actually changed my mind as to my initial criticism. After more careful study of the design of the Bitcoin network and trying to understand the exact manner in which Bitcoin attempts to create value from the computational work invested, [\u2026] thinking now is that bitcoin does not, in fact \u2018waste\u2019 computational work at all \u2013 instead it works hard to deliver the most value possible from that computational work.\u201D","And Gridecoin went a step further, asserting that while \u201Cgovernment-issued fiat currency may not have any obvious energy burden beyond its printing,\u201D the \u201Cenergy cost of hiring police officers to enforce economic honesty\u201D far outweighed the energy costs involved with mining tokens on the Bitcoin network.","Modern-day Redditors appear enchanted by the exchange.","One mused: \u201CI love how smart Satoshi sounds.\u201D","Some returned to the key points made in the 2010 discussion, with one remarking that \u201Ceverything has a price\u201D and bemoaning \u201Ccarbon clowns trying to make trouble.\u201D","But another pined for days gone by on the internet, and times of more civil exchanges, writing,","\u201CI love that proper conversation and change of opinion was still possible in 2010. Discussions were not motivated by political bias and ultimately ending in ad hominems, but by the actual will to learn and understand things. It is so refreshing to look back at.\u201D","____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto from NSA, AntiChrist and Other Bitcoin Conspiracy Theories\n\u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto Mined More Than 1 Million Bitcoin \u2013 Report\n\u2013 Bitcoin Miners Buy Oversupplied Energy, Turn To Renewables \u2013 Nic Carter\n\u2013 Why Bitcoin\u2019s Energy Consumption May Be a Price Worth Paying\n\u2013 Norwegian Giant Aker Goes Bitcoin, Defends BTC Mining, Eyes Micropayments\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining in 2021: Growth, Consolidation, Renewables, and Regulation\n\u2013 Bitcoiners May Change Their Mind on PoS, \u2018Who Knows,\u2019 Says Buterin"],"entity":[{"type":"August 7, 2010","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2010","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakomoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nic Carter\n\u2013 Why Bitcoin\u2019s Energy Consumption","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gridecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NSA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eyes Micropayments\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nakomoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Miners Buy Oversupplied Energy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Mining","Satoshi Nakamoto"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
