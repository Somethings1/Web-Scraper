It can be noticed that the three jump and drop at similar or same times, but the difference in interest for each is large. On average in the past week, BTC stood at the value of 36, ETH at 7, and USDT at 1.","The rise in interest for crypto is happening at the time when Turkey\u2019s currency lira plummeted 14% after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan fired the country\u2019s central bank governor Naci Agbal on Saturday, who\u2019s the third person on that role to exit in less than two years, reported BBC. Erdogan\u2019s move was reportedly quite a surprise, shocking both the local and foreign investors.","Per the article, Agbal, who was appointed in November, had decided to raise interest rates to combat inflation, and TRY jumped last week. Turkey\u2019s central bank\u2019s recent monetary policy was praised domestically and abroad, while at one point lira stood as the best performing emerging-market currency of 2021. His moves helped \u201Cto push the lira up 18% against the US dollar [\u2026] winning plaudits from investors,\u201D Reuters reported.","Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at currency exchange firm OANDA, was quoted as saying that the \u201Cbase premise of Erdonomics [Erdoğan\u2019s economics] is that higher interest rates cause higher inflation, a theory that flies in the face of conventional economic theory everywhere.\u201D","Erdoğan\u2019s move also came at a really bad time for Turkish economy, some argue.","But this lira\u2019s drop could turn to be a blessing in disguise, argued entrepreneur and crypto-focused venture capitalist Marc van der Chijs \u2013 as citizens may be embracing BTC sooner.","Meanwhile, the old Turkish Lira (TRL) became obsolete when it was replaced with the New Turkish Lira (TRY) in 2005. The old lira\u2019s value had dropped tremendously, and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey passed a law in 2003 to enable redenomination by the removal of six zeros from the Turkish lira, and the creation of the new currency.","Some see this scenario repeating. \u201CFun fact,\u201D said Three Arrows Capital\u2018s Zhu Su. The \u201Creason Turkish Lira is TRY and not TRL is [because] they\u2019ve already re-denominated before due to massive hyperinflation.\u201D He\u2019d \u201Cwager that on a long enough time frame, developed country currencies will undergo similar re-denominations. Be prepared.\u201D","Others pointed out the common trend of criticizing BTC\u2019s and cryptos\u2019 volatility while disregarding fiat\u2019s.","At 10:45 UTC, BTC is trading at USD 58,253 and is up by 3% in a day, trimming its weekly losses to less than 2%. ETH is changing hands at USD 1,806, having increased almost 2% in a day, while it\u2019s down by 3% in a week.\n____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Inflation Is Here & Bitcoin Will Hit USD 115K \u2018Ahead of Target\u2019 \u2013 Pantera\n\u2013 Why The Return Of High Inflation Can No Longer Be Excluded\n\u2013 Dalio Disses Dollar Debt, But Warns Gov\u2019ts May Target Bitcoin & Gold\n\u2013 A Debt-Fuelled Economic Crisis & Bitcoin: What to Expect?\n\u2013 Huobi Expands to Turkey as Turks Flock to Crypto\n\u2013 Why is Crypto Business Rushing to Turkey?\n___\n(Updated at 14:33 UTC with a comment from Mohamed El-Erian, an economic adviser at Allianz.)"],"entity":[{"type":"Turkey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mohamed El","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Agbal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jeffrey Halley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Marc","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 21","content":"DATE"},{"type":"OANDA","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Three Arrows Capital\u2018s Zhu Su","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2003","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2005","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Fuelled Economic Crisis & Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Naci Agbal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Erian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Allianz","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tayyip Erdoğan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"18%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"14%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May Target Bitcoin & Gold","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grand National Assembly of Turkey","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","Central Bank","Economics","Ethereum","Tether"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
