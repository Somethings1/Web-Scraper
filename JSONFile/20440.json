The nation passed a full FATF audit in 2019, where its compliance level was awarded the body\u2019s highest ranking.","The FATF has a compliance standard for \u201Cmonitoring and countering suspicious transactions with virtual assets and cryptocurrency.\u201D","The latest report notes that Russia\u2019s rating was lowered from a rating of \u201Ccompliant\u201D to \u201Cpartially compliant.\u201D","Neglyad concurred that there was a need to respond to the downgrading. He admitted that Russia\u2019s crypto regulations needed attention. Neglyad said:","\u201CThe extent to which Russia complies with the [\u2026] recommendations has been assessed. Russia\u2019s rating was downgraded to [its] partial compliance. That indicates a remaining weakness in this area. First of all, there is a need to regulate the circulation of cryptocurrency.\u201D","The Rosfinmonitoring chief added that Moscow needs to police the \u201Cactivities of cryptocurrency exchanges.\u201D","He added that the government needs to move in line with domestic \u201Cfinancial organizations.\u201D","The FATF report noted that Russia \u201Chas taken some steps\u201D to address crypto regulation, but noted that these were insufficient.","This is likely a reference to a piece of legislation introduced in mid-2020 entitled \u201COn Digital Financial Assets.\u201D","Russian crypto industry experts at the time told Cryptonews.com that the law was, in effect, little more than a glorified \u201Cglossary\u201D of crypto-related terms.","The law banned the use of crypto as a form of payment in Russia, but included no further regulatory measures. All subsequent attempts to regulate the industry have failed.","This is largely due to an impasse between the Central Bank and major government ministries.","The US and UK have held high-level conversations over security risks that may be triggered if the two countries hold elections around the same time later this year https:\/\/t.co\/rUKTs9AIzl","\u2014 Bloomberg (@business) February 28, 2024","","The ministries want to \u201Clegalize\u201D the resurgent domestic crypto sector and bring it into the tax system. In particular, they hope to tax Russia\u2019s burgeoning crypto mining sector.","However, the Central Bank would prefer to ban crypto altogether. The bank would prefer to press ahead with its fast-tracked digital ruble project.","The issue has been muddied somewhat by the fact that many Russian firms have begun using crypto as a cross-border payment tool to circumvent US, UK, and EU-led sanctions.","According to Rosfinmonitoring data, the number of transactions conducted in Russia using crypto tripled from the beginning of last year to November 2023.","The agency head, Yuri Chikhanchin, previously urged lawmakers to decide how they want to regulate the sector \u201Cas quickly as possible.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Digital Financial Assets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Russia FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 23","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last year to November 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Yuri Chikhanchin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"EAG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moscow","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Financial Action Task Force (FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 28, 2024","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Financial Action Task Force","Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
