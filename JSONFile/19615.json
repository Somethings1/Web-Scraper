Monday was actually the day that Dogecoin futures launched on Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange.","Today is the amended date Coinbase is supposed to launch #Dogecoin futures pic.twitter.com\/qJMHP6G9I4","\u2014 Crypto Daily Trade Signals (@cryptodailyTS) April 30, 2024","","For now, with macro risks in focus, price could continue ebbing lower. Recent data out of the US has shown weaker-than-expected growth, but hotter-than-expected inflation.","That\u2019s a bad combination for risk assets and complicates the outlook for Fed rate cuts.","Indeed, fading rate cut bets has been one reason for major cryptos losing bullish momentum in recent weeks.","Dogecoin could easily retest its mid-March and mid-April lows in the $0.12-13 area.","That being said, the long-term outlook remains robust for the meme coin.","Dogecoin remains the undisputed king of meme coins and is unlikely to lose this position thanks to Musk\u2019s ongoing backing.","Its not unsurprising then that traders continue predicting big things for Dogecoin.","One X user predicted that the coming bull cycle could launch DOGE as high as $3.80.","In all of #Dogecoins bull cycles it has never failed to meet or surpass the 1.618 Macro FIB extension measured from previous bull market highs to bear market lows.

Investors who get involved now can lock in potential gains of 200%.","Given its total token supply of 5.1 billion, investors who get in now are essentially buying into the project at a market cap of $16 million.","If 5thScape starts to gain traction as a market leader, it could easily become a $100+ million market cap coin.","If it was to reach a $300 million market cap, which isn\u2019t that much to ask midway through a crypto bull run, that would mean over 1,700% gains for presale investors.","$5SCAPE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB, or card.","80% of the total token supply is available for purchase in the presale.","Buy 5SCAPE Here","Here\u2019s why 5SCAPE is one of popular crypto presale analyst Michael Wrubel\u2019s top picks for 2024.","",""],"entity":[{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Michael Wrubel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.00327","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.12","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$5.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.14","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Daily Trade Signals","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dogecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1,700%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"13","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kevin (","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3.80","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"200%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Dogecoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5SCAPE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 30, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$300 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$16 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["DOGE","Dogecoin","virtual reality ICO"],"authors":["Joel Frank"]}
