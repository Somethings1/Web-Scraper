CEO Zac Prince, who testified as a government witness in Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial, claims the FTX founder\u2019s actions directly caused BlockFi\u2019s bankruptcy.","","In 2023, BlockFi announced it was shutting down and planned to return customers\u2019 crypto holdings. The deadline for most customers to request withdrawals was April 28, 2024.","On Thursday, the lender told clients that since the deadline to withdraw their digital assets from the current estate distribution has passed, clients will receive instructions on how to set up a Coinbase account. Through this method, they can withdraw their digital assets if they have an existing or new approved Coinbase account.","The company is also giving another chance to those who missed the withdrawal deadline. They will still have the option to withdraw from BlockFi\u2019s platform. Those who do not establish an approved Coinbase account may have their assets liquidated into cash and distributed to them accordingly.","","The plan administrator will have the power to use Coinbase for upcoming distribution rounds, which may involve distributions from recovered funds from FTX. Without this capability, the administrator would be limited to distributing cash for subsequent distributions.","BlockFi said it does not plan to collaborate with any additional providers for cryptocurrency distributions. Consequently, it cautioned investors to remain vigilant against potential scam attempts from third-party entities. BlockFi has previously been the target of fraudulent activity, where claimants received deceptive emails resembling legitimate communications, falsely promising immediate withdrawals of their remaining balances.","Customers were further encouraged to retrieve their transaction history, tax documents, and any other pertinent information from BlockFi before the shutdown occurs."],"entity":[{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New Jersey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nov. 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Zac Prince","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 28, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["BlockFi","Coinbase"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
