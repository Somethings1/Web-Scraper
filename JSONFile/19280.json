Software development firm Consensys filed a lawsuit against the regulator Thursday over purportedly attempting to regulate Ethereum as a security.","Conversely, Warren has continued to advocate for stringent digital asset regulation, including the passage of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA). This act would heavily expand know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws to several critical actors in the crypto space, including miners, validators, and more.","\u201CName your bad guy and crypto is the way they can move money around,\u201D Warren said in a recent senate committee hearing earlier this month.Â ","Deaton\u2019s latest legal boost to Coinbase suggests increasing tension over the U.S. government\u2019s treatment of the digital asset ecosystem.
