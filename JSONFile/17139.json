As president, I will end the efforts to move toward a CBDC. #Kennedy24 pic.twitter.com\/gao3D1HAeM","\u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) January 24, 2024","","The Democratic candidate notes that he disagrees with a move by the United States Government to launch a CBDC calling it an instrument of government control over citizens.","This control and scrutiny over each transaction like an alcohol or medicine purchase will heighten political pressure on users and result in blackmail.","\u201CIt\u2019s a calamity for human and civil rights.
