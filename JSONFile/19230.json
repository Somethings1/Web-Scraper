The Series A round, co-led by Goldman Sachs and early-stage venture fund Dawn Capital, raised its valuation to $500m.","Barclays, Citi, and Two Sigma are among other TradFi heavyweights backing Elwood. Galaxy Digital, Chimera Capital, and DCG also back the firm.","Elwood, which offers a full Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, hooks up with crypto exchanges worldwide, letting institutional investors trade digital assets.","Crunchbase data shows that Howard personally made substantial investments in the crypto sector, supporting around 40 crypto companies like Polygon and Komainu.","The UK-based firm now expects TradFi players to invest more in digital assets, despite 2022\u2019s setbacks. It is one of the first digital asset service providers authorized by the FCA, per Elwood\u2019s CEO.","Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs\u2019 head of digital assets, said the FCA\u2019s approval indicates Elwood\u2019s progress in building regulatory-compliant digital asset infrastructure.","\u201CWe are excited to be a key stakeholder of Elwood Technologies and encouraged by the strides taken in the UK to bring digital asset companies in line with the strong regulatory expectations of the traditional finance world,\u201D he said in a statement.","It\u2019s worth noting that the FCA has a multi-step process in place to authorize companies operating in the crypto space.","First, companies need to check if their activities fit within the Money Laundering Regulations and the FCA\u2019s rules. When approved, the company will be listed in the FCA\u2019s register and receive a unique identification number."],"entity":[{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Howard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$70m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Chimera Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Conduct Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Komainu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$500m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Money Laundering Regulations","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mathew McDermott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elwood Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alan Howard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Citi","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Trading","FCA","UK"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
