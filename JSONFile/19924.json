The recent trading frenzy shows the demand for digital products is there.","However, Goldman Sachs remains skeptical and old-school about Bitcoin. Mossavar-Rahmani, questions the value of Bitcoin, and told the publication \u201CIf you cannot assign a value, then how can you be bullish or bearish?\u201D \u2014  She went on to add that clients have not shown interest in Bitcoin.","Recently Goldman Sachs\u2019 hedge fund clients were reportedly showing increased interest in crypto derivatives, spurred by the resurgence of the crypto market. The bank officially launched its crypto trading desk in 2021. It then began to facilitate various Bitcoin-linked trades, including Bitcoin non-deliverable futures and CME BTC futures, following years of contemplation dating back to 2017.","Currently, Goldman offers cash-settled Bitcoin and Ether option trading, alongside CME-listed Bitcoin and Ether futures. However, it does not directly trade the actual underlying crypto tokens themselves, reports Shalini Nagarajan from Cryptonews.","Max Minton, Goldman\u2019s Asia Pacific head of digital assets, has said in an interview that the recent approval of ETFs has reignited interest and activity among the bank\u2019s clients.","Minton noted that many clients are either currently active in the crypto space or are considering entering it. There has been a noticeable increase in client interest, onboarding, pipeline, and trading volume since the beginning of the year.","In 2021, it emerged Goldman Sachs, ICAP, JPMorgan, and UBS had all bought the first exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe that offered exposure to Polkadot\u2019s DOT cryptocurrency for clients, as reported by CoinDesk. "],"entity":[{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CME BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UBS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sharmin Mossavar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ICAP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shalini Nagarajan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goldman","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goldman\u2019s Asia Pacific","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Minton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Rahmani","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs\u2019","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Max Minton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","FUD","Goldman Sachs"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
