CoinJoin is a way of combining multiple bitcoin transactions to enhance privacy.","Trezor says the Model T is the first and only hardware wallet to enable CoinJoin transactions for bitcoin. Several software or \u201Chot\u201D wallets like zkSNACKs\u2019 Wasabi wallet already have CoinJoin. The feature will be rolled out to Trezor\u2019s Model One devices at a future date, according to the company.","Most transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are publicly available. A basic tool such as a block explorer \u2013 a piece of software for analyzing cryptocurrency transactions \u2013 is all it takes to tie those transactions to real life identities and violate users\u2019 financial privacy.","CoinJoin attempts to reinstate privacy by combining multiple bitcoin payments from multiple spenders to produce a single transaction whose history and ownership are obfuscated.","CoinJoin can be done through decentralized coinjoin marketplaces such as JoinMarket, or through wallets like Trezor\u2019s Model T or zkSNACKs\u2019 Wasabi wallet. Both Model T and Wasabi use zkSNACKs\u2019 CoinJoin service that charges a coordination fee \u2013 0.3% of the coinjoined amount according to Trezor.","Per Trezor\u2019s release: \u201CUsers simply click on the \u2018anonymize\u2019 button. Users then choose the number of CoinJoin rounds \u2014 with every round increasing the level of privacy \u2014 confirm their choices on the Trezor device, and the rest of the coinjoin process is automated and requires no active user participation.\u201D","Trezor\u2019s other privacy features include Tor, coin control, and Shamir backup.","\u201CTrezor values privacy as an individual\u2019s most important asset,\u201D said Matěj Žák, CEO of Trezor. \u201CConsequently, we\u2019re delighted that we\u2019ve found a way for our community to keep their bitcoin history private.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Matěj Žák","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"0.3%","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Trezor","Wasabi Wallet","CoinJoin","Privacy"],"authors":["Frederick Munawa"]}
