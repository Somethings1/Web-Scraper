Gemini partnered with Genesis as its lending partner for the Earn product.","SEC Chairman Gary Gensler explained the regulatory enforcement, saying, \u201CWe charged Genesis with failing to register its retail crypto lending product before offering it to the public, bypassing essential disclosure requirements designed to protect investors.\u201D","In November 2022, following the implosion of FTX, Genesis paused withdrawals from Gemini Earn customers, which froze assets of thousands of Earn customers. At the time, Gemini Earn customers had approximately $900 million in assets locked up in Genesis.","Today\u2019s settlement with the SEC concludes over 14 months of court proceedings. The financial watchdog also explained that Genesis consented to a final judgement that imposes a permanent ruling prohibiting them from engaging in future violation of registration provisions in federal securities laws.","\u201CToday\u2019s settlement builds on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws,\u201D Gensler noted in the release. \u201CDoing so best protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It\u2019s not optional. It\u2019s the law.\u201D","According to the press release, the $21 million civil penalty will only be paid to the SEC after all lingering claims have been satisfied in the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. One of the claims to be fulfilled before paying the fine is that Gemini Earn investors are made whole.","While Genesis did not deny or admit to the SEC\u2019s allegations, the penalty could set a precedent for other crypto exchanges in court with the regulator on charges related to unregistered securities.","As part of the plans to repay its customers, Genesis disclosed its intent on February 28 to refund over $1.1 billion to Gemini Earn investors.","According to Genesis, investors will receive 100% of their crypto assets and possible bonuses.","\u201CThis means, for example, that if you had lent one bitcoin in the Earn program, you would receive one bitcoin back. And it means that you will receive any and all appreciation of your assets since you lent them into the Earn program,\u201D the company wrote. \u201CIf approved, we will be returning over $1.8 billion in value (at today\u2019s prices)\u2014$700 million more than when Genesis halted withdrawals on November 16, 2022.\u201D","The settlement with the SEC comes a few weeks after it settled with the New York Attorney General (NYAG).","The NYAG sued DCG, Genesis, and Gemini last year. Attorney General Letitia James alleged that they conspired in fraudulent schemes involving Gemini\u2019s Earn product.","The Digital Currency Group (DCG), Genesis\u2019 parent company, strongly opposed the settlement, arguing that the settlement between the New York Attorney General (NYAG) and Genesis was not genuine.","Genesis \u201Ccannot, under the guise of a \u2018settlement,\u2019 take value from lower classes and redistribute it to preferred creditors in violation of absolute priority,\u201D DCG explained.","DCG is a venture capital firm focusing on the crypto markets that owns some notable crypto brands, including crypto lender Genesis, Bitcoin exchange Luno, and Grayscale Investments."],"entity":[{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Letitia James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$700 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 16, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$900 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$21 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gemini Earn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Genesis Global Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Gemini","Genesis","SEC"],"authors":["Jimmy Aki"]}
