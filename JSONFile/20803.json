However, regulatory agencies like the SEC continue to monitor the cryptocurrency space and may provide further guidance and sudden change or new rulings in the future. It\u2019s essential to stay updated on regulatory developments.","It has been widely reported that a number of U.S. based companies have received subpoenas attempting to label ETH as a security.","Kenzi Wang, the co-founder and general partner at Symbolic Capital, told Cryptonews, it is highly unlikely the SEC will classify Ethereum as a security. Wang explains, the SEC now classifying ETH as a security would not only undo years of precedent, but also be directly contradictory to their partner regulatory body the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).","\u201CWhile the SEC continues to levy vague statements about the potential security status of ETH, the CFTC has clearly stated that they view ETH as a commodity \u2014 most clearly in 2022 filings around the FTX\/Alameda investigation,\u201D said Wang. ","The SEC itself approved ETH futures trading on regulated exchanges more recently in late 2023. During this approval process, the SEC took no action to change the commodity classification of ETH by the CFTC, explains Wang. ","\u201CMisalignment between these two regulators [SEC and CFTC] is not only harmful to the public, but also a major reason why we don\u2019t see the SEC moving forward with security classification of ETH,\u201D argues Wang.","Several applications have been submitted for a Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the SEC and the decision for approving or denying the products has been pushed back which is in line with analyst expectations.","The SEC now has until May 23 to approve or reject VanEck\u2019s ETF application for an Ethereum ETF tracking the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency.","HANetf founder and co-CEO Hector McNeil told Cryptonews, the SEC will use the review of ETH as a security to delay its decision to approve ETH ETFs by \u201Ckicking the can down the road.\u201D","If the SEC moves ahead to reclassify ETH as a security this would terminate any SEC applications with ETH ETFs in its current form, explains Laurent Kssis, head of CEC Capital.","\u201CYou cannot change an asset overnight from commodity to securities as the ETH futures are considered defacto non-security and not within the scope of the CFTC and not within its regulatory framework,\u201D adds Kssis.","\u201CA security is a representation of a slice of ownership of or rights to an asset or a company. Transferring ownership of an asset to a blockchain and assigning it a token is called tokenisation,\u201D explains Kssis.","Combining the two ideas creates a security token, a digital representation of ownership of or rights to an asset that has been tokenised and stored on a blockchain.  An investment asset, a security token is a digital asset that represents ownership or other rights. It transfers value from an asset or bundle of assets to whoever holds the private keys to the token.","\u201CIn plain language, security tokens are the digital form of traditional investments like stocks and bonds. Tokens are viewed as securities by regulators when they meet the criteria set by the Howey test; that is, there is an investment of money, a common enterprise, and a reasonable expectation of profit through the effort of others,\u201D adds Kssis.","Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, was developed to be used to pay transaction fees within the Ethereum network therefore ETH is a cryptocurrency. However, because it is being traded on exchanges and held for its increasing value, investors treat it as a security token. These tokens, like stocks, must be registered with the SEC.","If the SEC does re-classify ETH as a security this will trigger de-listing.","Oliver Gale, co-founder and CEO of Panther, explains: \u201CETH is not a security \u2013 the ICO was a sale of securities,\u201D adding \u201Clong term, decentralisation and global competition wins.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Oliver Gale","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Symbolic Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Laurent Kssis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hector McNeil","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kssis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Howey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cryptonews","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CEC Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kenzi Wang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 23","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulation","Ethereum","Securities Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
