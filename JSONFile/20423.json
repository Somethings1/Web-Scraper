Operating in the U.S. is no longer feasible,\u201D Bittrex co-founder Richie Lai said at the time. "],"entity":[{"type":"Shanghai Pudong Development Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Richie Lai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank of China","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monetary Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"MAS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bank of Communications","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Banks","Singapore"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
