Those who had a sell, they sold, and those who were leveraged, got out of the leverage \u2013 \u201Cand so, it\u2019s a pretty clean market right now.\u201D","Therefore, he warned,","\u201C2023 is a year you wanna survive.\u201D","Novogratz went on to say that \u201Cthe outlook for crypto is not horrible, but it\u2019s not great.\u201D He noted that,","\u201CWe\u2019ve got regulatory headwinds that we didn\u2019t have before, we\u2019ve got time to heal and rebuild narrative, and so people are gonna cut costs and survive this transition period.\u201D","And there is more good news for the industry, as the CEO suggested that, long term, \u201Ccrypto is not going away.\u201D The prices of bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) have held \u201Cpretty steady\u201D over the last couple of months and have gone up in the last few days, he said. ","At 9:10 UTC on Wednesday morning, BTC is up 1% in a day and 4.5% in a week, trading at $17,442. At the same time, ETH is changing hands at $1,334. It is up less than 1% over the past 24 hours and nearly 10% in a week. ","And though the market is \u201Cpretty clean,\u201D as Novogratz said, there are still \u201Csome overhangs \u2013 DCG, and Genesis, and Gemini \u2013 that will play out in the next quarter, that\u2019s not gonna be great,\u201D he stated, adding that, ","\u201CI don\u2019t think it will include a lot of selling, it\u2019s just not good news.\u201D ","The CEO\u2019s comments come at a time of an ongoing crypto winter and general uncertainty in the industry \u2013 prompted by a number of major companies collapsing, not the least of which is the FTX exchange, and contagions spreading for months now. ","Before FTX, the industry was significantly shaken by the falls of Terra\/LUNA, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius Network, to name just three. Meanwhile, a great number of companies continue to work on cutting costs, with a string of layoffs unfolding within the industry, in order to avoid further losses or even bankruptcies. ","As for the companies Novogratz named, in the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse, Genesis Global Capital, the lending arm of Genesis which is also owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), announced that it was temporarily suspending redemptions and new loan originations. And just days ago, Derar Islim, the interim CEO of Genesis Global Trading, told clients that they needed more time to resolve the financial crisis plaguing its lending business.","Furthermore, DCG is being investigated by US prosecutors for internal transfers between the parent company and its lender, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources. ","Meanwhile, crypto billionaires and founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are being sued by investors over their interest-earning Gemini Earn program.","You can watch the full interview here: ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Billionaire Investor Mike Novogratz Says Not All Crypto Exchanges Are Criminal Organizations Like FTX\n\u2013 Billionaire Mike Novogratz Says These Cryptos Are Here to Stay Despite Current Bear Market \u2013 Here\u2019s What You Need to Know\n\n\u2013 Billion-Dollar NFT Platform Backed By Gary Vee Cuts a Third of Workforce Amid Market Downturn \u2013 Here\u2019s What You Need to Know\n\u2013 Crypto Payments Company Wyre Reportedly Shutting Down Due to Market Downturn, Recently Valued at $1.5 Billion \u2013 Bear Market Getting Worse?\n\n\u2013 Creditors of Troubled Crypto Brokerage Genesis Seek Options to Avoid Bankruptcy\n\u2013 Gemini Exchange Seeks to Retrieve $900 Million from Crypto Lender Genesis"],"entity":[{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.5 Billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"4.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"next quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dollar NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Celsius Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$17,442","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1,334","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Third of Workforce Amid Market Downturn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tyler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Terra\/LUNA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Lender Genesis","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Genesis Global Trading","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Derar Islim","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Vee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Payments Company Wyre","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"winter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Cameron Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Not All Crypto Exchanges Are Criminal Organizations Like FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$900 Million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Genesis Global Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency","Ethereum","Gemini","Market","Mike Novogratz"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
