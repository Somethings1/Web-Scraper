They may have appeared safer, as they trade on the CME Group\u2019s regulated futures exchange. But they derive their value from spot prices established on crypto exchanges.","This is why a US Court of Appeals overturned the regulator\u2019s denial of a spot Bitcoin ETF application.","\u201CEven so, Gensler should\u2019ve tried to use this opportunity to force some investor protections on the spot trading platforms,\u201D the editors said.","The SEC could\u2019ve made approval conditional on the ETFs deriving prices from platforms that meet the standards of regulated securities exchanges.","That way, \u201Cfor all their resistance to regulation,\u201D trading platforms would have had an economic incentive and pressure from the ETF sponsors \u201Cto adopt much-needed reforms,\u201D they wrote.","Crypto traders could have tripled their funds by basing their investments on Reddit mentions. More precisely, they\u2019d need to have checked whether the number of posts mentioning a crypto was greater than the day before, New Scientist reported.","The trading technique was uncovered by Emiliano De Cristofaro, a Professor at the University of California, Riverside, and his colleagues, the report said.","They analyzed over 130 million posts on 122 subreddits between 1 June 2005 and 31 August 2022. Then, they tracked the price of 30 cryptocurrencies mentioned in the posts.","\u201CThe researchers discovered a strong correlation for most cryptocurrencies between the level of conversation on Reddit, compared with the previous day, and a subsequent price increase. Similarly, decreases in the volume of posts about a cryptocurrency can foreshadow dropping prices.\u201D","Subsequently, they conducted a retrospective analysis. It revealed that if someone traded a crypto based on whether the number of posts rose, they could have made three times more than the invested sum.","Different cryptocurrencies saw different lags (time between increased mentions and increased price), the report noted. It was eleven days for Bitcoin and five days for Ethereum.","However, per co-author Jeremy Blackburn at Binghamton University in New York,","\u201CThis probably isn\u2019t the best trading scenario.\u201D","An average investor is unlikely to be able to track numerous posts made about a crypto across multiple subreddits.","Furthermore, the past correlation doesn\u2019t guarantee that the same trends will repeat.","Blackburn also commented on the nature of this link. He noted that cryptocurrency investors are more likely to interact on online platforms than offline.","Digital assets infrastructure provider Aquanow and crypto exchange Gate.io announced that they\u2019ve entered into a partnership to build global liquidity for the next wave of blockchain projects.","The partnership will help increase access to crypto markets, said Phil Sham, CEO of Aquanow. \u201CWe\u2019re proud to partner with an organization like Gate.io who has cultivated a strong reputation amongst its 13 million users.\u201D","Lin Han, CEO of Gate.io commented that the collaboration \u201Cis set to play a critical role in bridging the traditional and digital currency markets.\u201D It will offer users a comprehensive and innovative solution, he added."],"entity":[{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Emiliano De Cristofaro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jeremy Blackburn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the University of California","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg Editorial Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CME Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binghamton University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lin Han","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Phil Sham","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Riverside","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June 2005","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Court of Appeals","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Market","reddit"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
