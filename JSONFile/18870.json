That was the highest since last Tuesday.","The impressive price rise still leaves the Solana price lodged well within its $120-$160 range over the past month.","Wednesday\u2019s US CPI and Retail Sales could shake things up, as traders assess the interest rate outlook.","But ahead of then, the focus is on meme coins (and meme stocks) following Roaring Kitty\u2019s sudden return.","pic.twitter.com\/YgjVqtgcNS","\u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) May 13, 2024","","His return comes with gas fees very low across major blockchains like Ethereum.","wtf surely this is an all time low for $ETH gas fees? pic.twitter.com\/bVwiXhmpZB","\u2014 eztic (@eztic0) May 12, 2024","","Solana has marked itself out in 2024 as the number one meme coin blockchain.","If Roaring Kitty\u2019s return coupled with low gas fees can start a new meme coin season, Solana could be a key beneficiary.","Bitcoin (BTC), last at $63,000, also remains stuck within multi-month ranges and isn\u2019t likely to see a major breakout soon.","The macro backdrop remains uncertain, with traders unsure how soon and fast Fed rate cuts are coming.","Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have crawled to a halt. The April halving proved to be a sell-the-news event, with post-halving rallies typically not coming in for 4-6 months.","And we are heading into summer, typically a subdued\/bearish time for Bitcoin.","So Bitcoin could easily remain stuck within recent ranges for the foreseeable future. And that suggests that Solana might also be stuck within recent ranges.","But say meme coin season returns and Solana meme coins take center stage.","A break above $160 would open the door to a swift move back to $200.","However, should meme season fail, and the market\u2019s broader malaise turn into a sell-off, Solana could break lower.","$120 is key long-term support. Should this level break a quick test of $100 or lower would be on the cards.","Such a sell-off would likely see short-term holders with a low tolerance for riding a drawdown, often referred to as \u201Ccrypto tourists\u201D, panic sell into the hands of higher conviction dip-buyers and whales.","Such capitulation isn\u2019t yet obvious. But you can bet that under $100 the Solana whales will come piling in to scoop up more.","And this would be a great sign of a near-term bottom.","An exciting new Solana meme coin called Slothana (SLOTH) has seen an amazing start to life since its recent launch.","The Sloth-themed meme coin is up 550% since its May 1 launch, with a market cap now near $100 million.","ðŸš€ðŸ¦¥ It's LAMBO TIME for the $SLOTH community!
