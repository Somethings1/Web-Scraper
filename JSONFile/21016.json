There\u2019s no question about it,\u201D said O\u2019Leary. ",""," ","O\u2019Leary elaborated that since TikTok is a \u201Cglobal phenomenon\u201D it  would give a lot of users around the world greater ease of access to cryptocurrencies for conducting digital payment transfers between countries.  ","\u201CThis would have to be compliant, transparent, and obviously auditable so users would know who sent and received transactions. I would provide that. I think that\u2019s the potential of a platform this large,\u201D O\u2019Leary remarked. ","Although TikTok\u2019s potential sale is still underway, industry experts believe that implementing cryptocurrency into the platform may be beneficial for the app moving forward.","Alexander Mamasidikov, Founder and CEO of digital payment solution platform CrossFi, told Cryptonews that incorporating crypto payments into TikTok could play a positive role in spreading crypto content as well. ","\u201CA main feature of TikTok is the phenomenon of self-reproduction, which is the willingness of users to generate mass content on their own,\u201D said Mamasidikov. \u201CSupporting cryptocurrency would allow users to create crypto-focused content on a huge scale.\u201D","Mamasidikov added that mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency would likely take off given TikTok\u2019s Generation Z user base.","\u201CTikTok users are typically open to innovation, appreciate quick solutions to problems, and can easily incorporate new technologies into everyday life,\u201D he said. ","Shira Lazar, Founder and CEO of news outlet What\u2019s Trending, told Cryptonews that incorporating cryptocurrency as gifts during TikTok live streams or as tipping mechanisms could be a smart move for the platform. ","\u201CThis seems pretty obvious as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream,\u201D said Lazar.","Lazar \u2013 who has over 620,000 followers on TikTok \u2013 further noted that if TikTok users can earn fiat, the same option should be made available for cryptocurrency payments. ","\u201CWhy should TikTok not consider crypto as an option? More people seem to be holding crypto over cash internationally, as well,\u201D she said. ","To Lazar\u2019s point, crypto adoption is very apparent in countries like El Salvador, where Bitcoin has been accepted as legal tender since 2021. Other countries like Nigeria and Turkey also rank as the biggest adopters of cryptocurrency this year. ","Although cryptocurrency payments may be a logical next step for an app like TikTok, challenges are likely to arise. ","Tim Delhaes, CEO of smart-wallet provider Grindery, told Cryptonews that while incorporating crypto payments into social media platforms represents a big opportunity, compliance and regulation may be problematic. ","Speaking from experience, Delhaes shared that Grindery recently announced an integration with the messaging platform Telegram to allow users to leverage cryptocurrency within the app.  ","\u201CGrindery enables Telegram users to create a wallet without needing passphrases or private keys. Users can then send any token to other Telegram users without knowing their wallet addresses, and swap tokens quickly and without gas fees,\u201D said Delhaes. ","Grindery is still in its beta stage, yet Delhaes noted that the platform has already attracted over 700,000 sign-ups. While notable, Delhaes pointed out that meeting regulations hasn\u2019t been an easy task. ","\u201CGrindery\u2019s focus on Telegram stems from shared values in decentralization and privacy,\u201D he said. \u201COvercoming these challenges requires innovative approaches to compliance, leveraging blockchain\u2019s transparency and security features, and working closely with regulatory bodies to ensure all operations meet legal standards.\u201D ","This is important to point out, especially given the United States\u2019 critical stance toward cryptocurrency.","Regulations aside, Mamasidikov believes that the biggest challenge regarding cryptocurrency payments on TikTok will be technology related. ","\u201CWhen implementing the technology, it will be necessary to provide for the possibility of payment messages,\u201D he said. \u201CThis will allow users to transfer funds to each other seamlessly through the messenger built into the social network.\u201D","Lazar noted that TikTok could partner with crypto-friendly platforms like Paypal, Venmo, or Cashapp to ensure sufficient payment options. ","Regardless of challenges, Delhaes noted that crypto payments have the potential to transform social media platforms into \u201CSuper Apps.\u201D ","\u201CThis evolution is crucial for content creators, offering them new revenue streams, greater control over their earnings, and direct financial interactions with their audience, free from platform-specific constraints,\u201D he said. ","Delhaes pointed out that this has already been demonstrated by WeChat. The messaging platform incorporated digital yuan payments into its platform last year.","Yet in order for this model to be successful, Delhaes stressed the need for separation between blockchain payments and core business functions. If this isn\u2019t ensured, he pointed out that cryptocurrencies within TikTok could fail similarly to Facebook\u2019s Libra project, or Telegram\u2019s 2018 token launch. ","Mamasidikov further remarked that he believes alternative payment solutions will be implemented within many social networks in the future. He noted that this will also enable financial tools for citizens in developing countries that may not have access to traditional banking methods. ","\u201CI can say with confidence that the era when financial instruments were unavailable to 60% of the world\u2019s population will end very soon,\u201D he said. \u201CAny person on the planet, regardless of their place of residence, origin, wealth, will be able to use banking products and money transfers without a bank as social media platforms mature.\u201D "],"entity":[{"type":"Kevin O\u2019Leary","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Turkey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tim Delhaes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shira Lazar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CCP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"34%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shark Tank\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"TikTok","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wonderful","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mamasidikov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Delhaes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kevin O'Leary","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Venmo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Paypal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nigeria","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lazar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alexander Mamasidikov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ups","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Cryptocurrency","Social media","TikTok"],"authors":["Rachel Wolfson"]}
