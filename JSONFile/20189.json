Nothing has been getting assets as fast as IBIT,\u201D responded Fink. ","\u201CI\u2019m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin,\u201D said Fink. \u201CI mean, look as we\u2019re creating a market that has more liquidity and more transparency \u2014 and I\u2019m pleasantly surprised \u2026 I would never have predicted it before we filed it [IBIT] that we were going to see this type of retail [demand]\u201D adds Fink.","The Fox Business host went on to ask Fink about the ETH ETFs and the SEC making lots of noise about declaring ETH a security which will take it out of the Bitcoin category as a commodity. How would this impact BlackRock\u2019s ETH ETF application? ","Fink stressed he cannot discuss the BlackRock ETH ETF application in more detail but when pushed by the host about what will happen if the SEC brands ETH a security \u2014 it is still possible to start a ETH ETF?","\u201CI think so,\u201D responded Fink.","Currently the status of Ethereum is in limbo \u2013 ETH is not considered a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u2014 but this could all change very quickly.","It has been widely reported that a number of U.S. based companies have received subpoenas attempting to label ETH as a security.","Ethereum is viewed as a decentralized cryptocurrency, rather than a security. However, regulatory agencies like the SEC continue to monitor the cryptocurrency space and may provide further guidance and sudden change or new rulings in the future. It\u2019s essential to stay updated on regulatory developments.","According to HANetf founder and co-CEO Hector McNeil the SEC reviewing ETH as a security is one way to delay its decision to approve ETH ETFs by \u201Ckicking the can down the road.\u201D","If the SEC moves ahead to reclassify ETH as a security this would terminate any SEC applications with ETH ETFs in its current form, explains Laurent Kssis, head of CEC Capital.","\u201CYou cannot change an asset overnight from commodity to securities as the ETH futures are considered defacto non-security and not within the scope of the CFTC and not within its regulatory framework,\u201D Kssis told Cryptonews in an interview."],"entity":[{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Larry Fink","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Laurent Kssis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fink","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hector McNeil","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fox Business","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kssis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BlackRock ETH ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CEC Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF","Ethereum","Larry Fink"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
