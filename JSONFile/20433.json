Three American economists have been awarded the Prize for their work on bank runs Ben Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig.","\u201CTheir discoveries improved how society deals with financial crises,\u201D said the Academy.","It added that the trio\u2019s \u201Canalyses have been of great practical importance in regulating financial markets and dealing with financial crises.\u201D","But the Cryptoverse argued that Nakamoto should have been rewarded for his contribution to the world, claiming that he is the most deserving candidate. On the other hand, when it comes to this year\u2019s winner, crypto artist Lucho Poleti noted on Tuesday that Ben Bernanke in 2008 \u201Cprinted money to bail out banks who proliferated a subprime debt bubble that caused a global financial crisis.\u201D","In 2008:\nBernanke printed money to bail out banks who proliferated a subprime debt bubble that caused a global financial crisis\n\nSatoshi created #Bitcoin, a money system that gives all humans economic freedom through the separation of money & state\n\nSatoshi deserves a Nobel Prize pic.twitter.com\/oOp8Lld5ww","Many others joined the argument in favor of honoring Nakamoto:","Others, however, argued that a Nobel Prize is not the way to honor Nakamoto, as it\u2019s a prize rewarding problematic legacy institutions.","Case in point. pic.twitter.com\/aPEsAoc8BG","This year is not the first time the idea of giving Nakamoto a Nobel Prize was proposed \u2013 far from it. It\u2019s been discussed for years now, and some, like Professor of Finance at UCLA Anderson School Bhagwan Chowdhry, wrote in 2015 about whether the Bitcoin creator should be nominated for it and on what basis.","Fridman tweeted the idea in June 2021 as well, and Bitcoin bull and former IT firm MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor shared that tweet, arguing that Nakamoto should be rewarded both for the invention of Bitcoin and \u201Cfor the invention of a monetary system that doesn\u2019t rest on the threat of violence.\u201D","Satoshi Nakamoto deserves the Nobel Prize in Economics for the invention of #Bitcoin, followed by the Nobel Peace Prize for the invention of a monetary system that doesn't rest on the threat of violence. https:\/\/t.co\/C7Qr9Otdvt","Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano said that Nakamoto should be the Prize recipient back in 2019.","Satoshi should win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWe finally have a currency that can assume global reserve status without anyone having to engage in violence.","It is unlikely, however, that an anonymous person could receive the Prize, based on The Nobel Prize FAQ page. As a person discussing this posted on a forum back in 2012: \u201CNobel prize can only be awarded to a living person. And since you can never determine whether an anonymous person is alive, I guess you can\u2019t award an anonymous entity a Nobel prize.\u201D","Meanwhile, in a bid to honor Nakamoto, a statue was unveiled in Hungary\u2019s capital Budapest a year ago. Created by Hungarian sculptors Tamas Gilly and Reka Gergely, the statue\u2019s hooded head is covered in a reflective surface resembling a mirror, suggesting that all Bitcoin enthusiasts can see themselves in Satoshi\u2019s face. "," ____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto is Dead, Thinks BitMEX\u2019s Arthur Hayes\n\u2013 Is This 1999 Forum Message from a Young Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\n\u2013 The Rise of a New Faketoshi?
