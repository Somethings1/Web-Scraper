And the platforms, the intermediaries are doing things that we would never allow or think the New York Stock or Nasdaq would do.\u201D"," "," "],"entity":[{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Matt Furlong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York Stock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 1, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"December 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["NFT","NFTs","Regulation"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
