They also announced a USD 500,000 fund \u201Cto help the creators and their communities affected by this.\u201D","They provided the attacker contract and the attacker contract creator address, with a balance of nearly USD 2m in ETH. It also shows ETH 1,900 transferred to privacy tool Tornado Cash.","The creator of WHALE, one of the affected social tokens, said that \u201Cthis represented 2.17% of total supply and it has been fully diluted into the market.\u201D The founder also said that the incident will not have \u201Ca material effect\u201D on WHALE\u2019s plans, near- or long-term, and that all tokens meant for community distribution have been secured in cold wallets.","To the hacker the creator said: \u201CYou did not steal from large corporations, you stole from hardworking individuals,\u201D but also noting that the team noticed \u201Ca large number of long term holding new wallets.\u201D","Igor Igamberdiev, an analyst at The Block, said that the victims actually approved the transfers, and that this \u201D indicates a possible private key compromise or inside job.\u201D","The community, meanwhile, seems to be taking the incident well:","But the weekend wasn\u2019t over yet. There was a report of an NFT hack as well. Third City Advisory founder Michael J. Miraflor claimed on Twitter that his NFTs were stolen from the Gemini-owned trading platform Nifty Gateway, transferred them to another account, sold some on a Discord channel, and purchased more than USD 10,000 worth of NFTs from a drop with the stored credit information. Credit card charges, Miraflor said, have been \u201Csince recovered.\u201D","Per his March 14 Twitter thread, the marketplace alerted him that \u2018he\u2019 sold something, but upon checking to confirm the transaction, Miraflor saw his entire collection had been emptied. He also received multiple fraud alerts from his credit card, after which he proceeded to let them know of the fraudulent charges, cancel his credit card, delete its information from the marketplace, and change the password.","But Miraflor also claims to know who the attackers were. \u201CSince all transactions including Transfers are recorded, I know the exact 2 accounts my stolen NFTs were sent to, as well as who fraudulently purchased from today\u2019s drop,\u201D he said. But he added that it seems he can\u2019t get the NFTs back anyways, stating that hackers and secondary market purchasers win here.","Another person also reported their account being hacked:","Nifty Gateway co-founder Griffin Cock Foster replied to Miraflor\u2019s tweet, saying that \u201Cit looks like a hacker got this user\u2019s password or gained access to their account another way,\u201D adding to \u201CMake sure you have Authy 2FA [two-factor authentication] on.\u201D Some commenters argued that enabling this type of authentication would have prevented the theft.","Later, Nifty Gateway said they \u201Chave seen no indication of compromise of\u201D their platform and that they are communicating \u201Cwith a small number of users who appear to have been impacted by an account takeover.\u201D","\u201COur analysis is ongoing, but our initial assessment indicates that the impact was limited, none of the impacted accounts had 2FA enabled, and access was obtained via valid account credentials,\u201D they said, encouraging their users to enable 2FA and never reuse passwords.","___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Crypto Security in 2021: More Threats Against DeFi and Individual Users\n\u2013 Justin Sun: Christie\u2019s Tech Glitch Stopped Me Paying USD 70M for Beeple NFT\n\u2013 Second-Hand NFT Market for NBA Top Shot Packs Appears on eBay\n\u2013 Consider These Legal Questions Before Spending Millions on NFTs\n\u2013 NFT Overtakes Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and XRP on Google\n\u2013 Grimes and Paris Hilton Go Full NFT \u2013 But Some Warn of Trouble Ahead\n\u2013 Check These 4 Make-Your-Own-NFT Platforms\n\u2013 Non-Fungible 2021: Prepare Your NFTs For DeFi, Staking, and Sharing","(Updated at 14:22 UTC: Michael J.
