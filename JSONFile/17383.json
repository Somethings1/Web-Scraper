Wikipedia began accepting coins like bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), and ethereum (ETH) in 2014, but White created a request for comment that was opened \u201Cto community input between January 10, 2022 and April 12, 2022,\u201D with a \u201Clittle under 400 users\u201D participating in \u201Cthe voting and discussion,\u201D with 232 (or just over 71%) voting in favor of ending crypto donations.","Congrats on cutting yourselves out of the most inclusive monetary system to ever exist üëç\n\nEveryone always comes back to #Bitcoin","Wikimedia has used BitPay as a payment gateway, but noted that in \u201Cthe last financial year,\u201D it had received just over USD 130,000 worth of donations in crypto from under 350 donors, adding:¬†","\u201CCrypto was around 0.08% of our revenue last year, and it remains one of our smallest revenue channels.\u201D¬†","Unsurprisingly for some, perhaps, concerns about the \u201Cenvironmental sustainability\u201D of both BTC and ETH were put forward. But there were also other reasons, including the accusation that \u201Caccepting cryptocurrencies constitutes implicit endorsement of the issues surrounding cryptocurrencies,\u201D as well as claims that there were \u201Crisks to \u201Cthe movement\u2019s reputation for accepting cryptocurrencies.\u201D","\u201CCryptocurrencies are extremely risky investments that have only been gaining popularity among retail investors particularly in recent times, and I do not think we should be endorsing their use in this way. In accepting them, I believe we are mainstreaming the usage of \u2018investments\u2019 and technology that are inherently predatory,\u201D according to White.","White concluded that Wikimedia risked \u201Cdamaging our reputation by participating\u201D in the crypto space, noting that \u201Cone our peers,\u201D Mozilla, was \u201Creevaluating their choice to accept cryptocurrency donations after considerable backlash from their supporters, including from their own founder.\u201D\n___\nLearn more:¬†\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Efficiency Up 63% in Year, \u2018Sustainable Electricity Mix\u2019 Jumped 59% \u2013 Bitcoin Mining Council\n\u2013 Ripple\u2019s Exec Campaign Has \u2018Zero Chance\u2019 of Forcing Bitcoin to Proof-of-Stake, But Brace for More Attacks\n\n\u2013 Illicit Activity\u2019s Share in Crypto Shrinks, \u2018Significant Problem\u2019 Remains\n\u2013 \u2018PoS Fanatics Attacking PoW are Actual Supervillains\u2019, Kraken\u2019s Powell Says as US Politicians Charge"],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BCH","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 10, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Shrinks","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"71%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Molly White","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"63%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mozilla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 12, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wikimedia Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.08%","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","Bitcoin Cash","Ecology","Ethereum","Payments"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
