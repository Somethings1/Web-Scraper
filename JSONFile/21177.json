But even if we did, I would, I would not want to use that authority. We really need to let these things play out.\u201D","Peirce, who is affectionately known in the space as \u201CCrypto Mom\u201D for her relatively pro-industry stance on regulation, claimed that \u201Cwhen things are a bit harder in the market,\u201D it would be easier to \u201Cdiscover who is actually building something that might last for the long longer term and what is going to pass away.\u201D","Peirce added that both industry players and the SEC could learn a lot from the recent crash. She claimed that the downturn would be \u201Chelpful\u201D to let observers \u201Csee the points of connection.\u201D The Commissioner called the slump a moment to learn \u201Cnot only for market participants\u201D but also for regulators, \u201Cso that we can have a better sense of how the market operates.\u201D","Meanwhile, Peirce also had some words of warning for those trying to navigate the bear market. She stated that some opportunist criminals would seek to target vulnerable investors, explaining:","\u201CScammers and fraudsters will figure out ways to take advantage of any set of market conditions to try to take advantage of other people. So I\u2019m sure their tactics are changing and they sometimes prey on people at their lowest points\u2026we\u2019re maybe more likely to get tips from times like this.\u201D","While Peirce appears keen to let flagging projects fail if they cannot take the pressure of a market crunch, not everyone appears to think that a \u201Csink or swim\u201D policy is beneficial in all cases.","Following news that the crypto lender BlockFi could be suffering from issues surrounding the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the crypto exchange FTX has stepped in with a \u201CUSD 250 million revolving credit facility\u201D package.","Typically, revolving credit facility arrangements involve an investor providing funds that can be drawn upon if and when they are needed.","On Twitter, FTX\u2019s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried explained that the exchange had backed BlockFi so that the latter could \u201Cnavigate the market from a position of strength.\u201D","He also stated that BlockFi is \u201Cfinancially strong.\u201D Bankman-Fried wrote that \u201Call\u201D of its \u201Coperations are normal, as they always have been, and assets are safe.\u201D","He wrote that BlockFi had removed \u201Ctroublesome counterparties\u201D before \u201Cthey become a problem\u201D and had correctly \u201Cadded cash\u201D to its operations \u201Cbefore it was necessary.\u201D","And, the FTX chief suggested, bigger fish should understand the risk of allowing strong players to go under. He wrote:","\u201CWe take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers.\u201D","And it\u2019s not just BlockFi: Alameda Research, FTX\u2019s parent company, gave USD 200m credit line (in cash and USDC coin (USDC)) and BTC 15,000 revolving facility to crypto exchange Voyager Digital, Bloomberg reported.","Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, is quoted as stating that,","\u201CSam Bankman-Fried is the new John Pierpont Morgan \u2014 he is bailing out cryptocurrency markets the way the original JPMorgan did after the crisis of 1907.\u201D","Scaramucci is referring to the 1907 Bankers\u2019 Panic that led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System. ","Bankman-Fried providing financing for these companies is  \u201Ca respected industry player supporting a systemically important firm with capital at a time where they think the bottom could be in, or close,\u201D according to Tom Dunleavy, senior research analyst at crypto-data firm Messari, noting that the move could also be compared to Warren Buffett providing support to Goldman Sachs in 2008. ","Similarly, Noel Hebert, director of credit research at Bloomberg Intelligence, argued that the situation is \u201Cnot unlike private equity shops that will invest more capital into portfolio companies amid distress\u201D \u2014 and it may or may not be enough. ","Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at asset-management firm Arca, was quoted as saying that the weekend behind us was \u201Ccritical\u201D for finding \u201Cwhite knights who could help develop a bid to stabilize this market,\u201D arguing that it \u201Cdoesn\u2019t take a lot of capital right now to support prices and failing lenders.\u201D That said, many players are incentivized to ensure that the industry does not fail, he added.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 \u2018Well-Informed\u2019 Commissioners Disagree on Crypto, But SEC\u2019s Approach \u2018Harmful\u2019\n\u2013 SEC\u2019s Pierce Returns to the Warpath to Criticize Poloniex Settlement\n\n\u2013 BlockFi Secures USD 250M Credit Line from Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX\n\u2013 US Fed to Blame for Downturn, Large Crypto Players Have Responsibility Toward Ecosystem \u2013 FTX CEO\n\n\u2013 Crypto Exchanges Backing Away from Sports Spending as Crunch Continues\n\u2013 BlockFi, Crypto.com, and Others Come Forward as Three Arrows Hires Advisers, Babel Finance Pauses Withdrawals\n\n\u2013 Babel Finance to Repay \u2018Some Debts\u2019 and \u2018Ease Its Short-term Liquidity Pressure\u2019\n\u2013 Bancor Pauses Protection Mechanism Due to \u2018Hostile Market Conditions\u2019"],"entity":[{"type":"Noel Hebert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tom Dunleavy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Anthony Scaramucci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jeff Dorman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Others Come Forward as Three Arrows Hires Advisers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Pierce Returns","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Reserve System","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Voyager Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John Pierpont Morgan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hester Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Warpath","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SkyBridge Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Large Crypto Players Have Responsibility Toward Ecosystem \u2013 FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2008","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Forbes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Short","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1907","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Babel Finance Pauses Withdrawals\n\n\u2013 Babel Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Warren Buffett","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["BlockFi","FTX","Lending","Market","Regulation","Sam Bankman-Fried","SEC"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
