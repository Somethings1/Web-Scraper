{"summary":"Even though 2022 was a bear market it was an eventful year for all facets of the crypto industry.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2023\/01\/09\/coindesk-researchs-2022-annual-crypto-review\/","publishDate":"2023-01-09T14:00:00","id":16417,"type":null,"title":"CoinDesk Research\u2019s 2022 Annual Crypto Review","category":["Finance"],"content":["As with all financial assets, market performance is usually the first thing that comes to mind when considering a \u201Cyear in review.\u201D Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) followed a blistering-hot 2021 with a 65% and 67% pullback in 2022.","As for macro assets, their correlation behavior with bitcoin remains an unfinished story. Only bonds ended the year within an uncorrelated band to bitcoin while stock indices maintained a somewhat positive correlation, and the U.S. dollar index maintained a somewhat negative correlation.","You\u2019re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.

Of the five largest public bitcoin miners measured by bitcoin hashrate, the best performer was CleanSpark, which still lost 79%. Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate marched steadily upward as mining machines purchased in the throes of the bull market came online. That, combined with poor bitcoin price performance, led to general difficulties in the mining industry.","That said, the amount of venture funding raised by blockchain and crypto companies increased in 2022, almost touching $30 billion. While the growth was far slower than it was in 2021, there was still plenty of venture capital invested as the venture funds that raised funds in 2021 needed to deploy that dry powder in 2022.","In the year of the bear market, we can find solace in the technology that continued to develop. The talk of the town for Ethereum was the successful implementation of the Merge, which moved the second-biggest blockchain from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ticked along, with more nodes enforcing 2021\u2019s Taproot upgrade while adding some exciting potential use cases to the Lightning Network \u2013 its commerce layer \u2013 through growth of the network and the announcement of Taro by Lightning Labs.","Meanwhile, it was a strange year in the world of policy. While massive legislative efforts such as the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill have crept closer to becoming law, few nations have actually implemented any new laws providing broad clarity for the treatment of digital assets. However, the massive failures in 2022 are likely to create new pressure for regulators to actually do something about the sector.","From a regulatory perspective, we\u2019ve seen a majority of Ethereum transactions comply with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) unit of the U.S. Treasury Department, which blacklisted the Tornado Cash mixer program in August and, in turn, led to one of its developers, Alexey Pertsev, being arrested.","Of course, any discussion of crypto in 2022 would be incomplete without discussing our first proper crypto credit crisis, which began with a glut of crypto lenders promising yield to customers in exchange for deposits and culminated with the arrest in the Bahamas and extradition to the U.S. of FTX and Alameda Research founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). It was years in the making and it\u2019s hardly the first credit crisis in financial history, but this one is definitively crypto\u2019s.","You can find this and more in CoinDesk Research\u2019s 2022 Annual Crypto Review here.","CORRECTION (Jan. 9 17:40 UTC): The Merge involved the Ethereum blockchain, not the ether currency."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lightning Network \u2013","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk Research\u2019s 2022 Annual Crypto Review","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Long & Short","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"79%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Treasury Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"65%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"67%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bahamas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Alexey Pertsev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lightning Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$30 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Long & Short","Bitcoin","Opinion","Mining","Venture funding","Ethereum","Policy","Credit","Reports"],"authors":["George Kaloudis"]}
