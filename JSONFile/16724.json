Minimal changes are needed to support Celo's unique features,\u201D the proposal reads. \u201CIt is battle-tested with multiple chains in production and compatible with other stacks, such as Polygon's Type 1 ZK Solution.\u201D","Read more: Celo Chooses Optimism, Concluding Bake-Off Among Layer 2s","UPDATE (17:36 UTC): Adds that Celo's actual transformation into a layer 2 on top of Ethereum won't officially finalize until the completion of upgrades by the blockchain's validators."],"entity":[{"type":"May 3","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Celo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Polygon CDK","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Celo","celo-foundation","cLabs","Optimism","Optimism foundation","layer 2"],"authors":["Margaux Nijkerk"]}
