This equates to roughly 221,000 BTC being taken off the market, a market shock mathematically much larger than even a Bitcoin halving event.","In fact, the next Bitcoin halving is due later this week. It will cut Bitcoin\u2019s supply inflation rate in half for the fourth time in the network\u2019s history. Starting around April 20, the asset\u2019s daily supply issuance will shrink from 900 BTC to 450 BTC, causing an even greater market supply shortage.","There is a supply squeeze mere days away. Blackrock and other ETF\u2019s are buying in excess 10,000 #bitcoin a day. What do you think will happen when only 450 new #bitcoin are mined a day ?","Micheal Saykor gives us an idea pic.twitter.com\/96X3pzE79f","\u2014 Tommy \u20BFoy⚡️21m (@CooliganFields) April 15, 2024","","However, Bybit\u2019s figures around ETF inflows may be outdated: the funds have seen very few net inflows since the beginning of April, and the price of Bitcoin has declined from $69,000 down to $62,000 over that time period.","Some cite escalating geopolitical conflicts between Israel and Iran as a potential catalyst for the selloff, while others believe investors could be selling their BTC in time for U.S. tax season.","Bybit also said there may be a pronounced Bitcoin selloff in the short term after the halving \u2013 particularly from weak mining firms.","\u201CUnprofitable miners might start selling their Bitcoin reserves in order to support their operations,\u201D wrote Bybit. \u201CHowever, once their reserves run out, the overall sell-side supply to CEXs will shrink.\u201D","Bybit also noted that miners had acted slightly differently from their pre-halving behaviour in 2022, however. While miners four years ago steadily accumulated leading up to the halving, firms have shown signs of unloading their reserves earlier in the current cycle.","\u201CBitcoin tends to rally twelve months after each halving, and there\u2019s a high probability that we might see a new ATH this time,\u201D the report stated,"],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$12.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Micheal Saykor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$69,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$500 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tommy \u20BFoy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Israel","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$62,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Iran","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Crypto Exchange"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
