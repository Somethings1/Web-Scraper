Join the discussion\u2026","\u2014 Polygon | Aggregated (@0xPolygon) March 20, 2024","","RollCall\u2019s efforts to implement RIP-7212 are not limited to Polygon alone. ","Other Layer 2 solutions, including ZkSync Era and Optimism, are also working towards integrating support for this upgrade in the near future. ","This collaborative approach among Layer 2 projects signifies a move towards collective development and the establishment of Layer 2 solutions as Ethereum\u2018s core scaling mechanism.","David Silverman, the VP of product at Polygon Labs, highlighted the significance of RollCall in solidifying Layer 2 solutions as a fundamental part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling strategy. ","He emphasized that RollCall provides a platform for the Ethereum ecosystem to govern itself effectively. ","\u201CAll of the rollups, we might fight a lot on Twitter, but we actually sit together in this new kind of committee [and] talk about proposed EVM changes \u2014 changes that are never going to actually come to Ethereum itself, but [that] the rollups are implementing to improve user behavior,\u201D Silverman said.","\u201CThe Ethereum Foundation and the broader community is looking at L2s as an innovation hub and place where users are going to first onboard, as opposed to just naturally going to Ethereum at first,\u201D he added. ",""],"entity":[{"type":"5656","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Napoli","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4844","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1153","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Napoli Hard Fork","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Polygon Community Contributors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Feijoa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"The Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Silverman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"David Silverman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dencun","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"7212","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3074","content":"DATE"},{"type":"6780","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Polygon Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 20, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Dencun","Ethereum","Polygon"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
