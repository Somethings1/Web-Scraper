While subject to further finalization, the Plan reflects the Global Settlement and represents another step towards confirmation and exit from Chapter 11, it said.","The Bankruptcy Court also approved the company\u2019s motion requesting to modify certain dates and deadlines with respect to the plan, including an extension of the deadlines to vote on the plan or file an objection to it.","The Court has agreed to reschedule the combined hearing to consider the final approval of the Disclosure Statement and confirmation of the Plan to January 16, 2024 (the \u201CCombined Hearing\u201D).","The company still expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in mid-to-late January 2024.","As a result of rescheduling the Combined Hearing, the deadline for participating in the Equity Rights Offering has been extended to Friday, January 5, 2024."],"entity":[{"type":"January 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto miner Core Scientific","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Manta Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Manta Network","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Scott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nary","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Manta","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"INX Digital Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 16, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Steve Scott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December 20, 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Security","USA"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
