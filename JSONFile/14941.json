Jones, Zhao said, \"There is no excuse for my failure to establish the necessary compliance controls at Binance\u201D and gave an assurance that this would be his only \u201Cencounter with the criminal justice system.\u201D","Going forward, Zhao said, he wanted to support biotech startups and the youth.
