The company also confirmed that it used the net proceeds \u201Cto obtain additional bitcoins.\u201D","It also \u201Cexpects to grant to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $90 million aggregate principal amount of the notes,\u201D the company said.","MicroStrategy shares rallied sharply today. They\u2019re currently up 13% to $1,550. Since MicroStrategy made buying Bitcoin part of its corporate strategy, many have viewed MicroStrategy shares as a proxy for Bitcoin, since the two tend to rise in tandem.","MicroStrategy is easily the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.","Bitcoin maxis are happy today as the world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency trades at an all-time high of around $72,000. The last time the industry looked this healthy was back in late 2021, when Bitcoin set a former ATH of around $69,000.","The fever pitch around Bitcoin is really concentrated on two overarching narratives that are really helping to drive prices: ETFs and the halving.","See Bitcoin is popular, but it\u2019s also very volatile and unregulated. Naturally, for investors in more traditional financial products, it can seem like a risky prospect.","Enter exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An ETF is essentially a Bitcoin fund, meaning it\u2019s an entity that directly buys and stores Bitcoin and uses the asset to create shares, which it then sells on exchanges.","These shares track the price of the underlying asset, but thanks to their regulated status, they have more guardrails to help build confidence in crypto among investors from traditional finance backgrounds.","Many crypto advocates had been pining for a Bitcoin ETF for the last decade. The oldest and most senior Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale, started with an eye to eventually converting to an ETF but the SEC knocked it back last year.","Grayscale took the SEC\u2019s rejection to an appeals court, where a judge ruled in Grayscale\u2019s favor, calling the rejection \u201Carbitrary and capricious\u201D.","The move forced the SEC to approve eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications earlier this year. They\u2019ve already been some of the most hyped and successful ETF launches in history.","Finally, the market is also looking towards Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving on April 19 to potentially drive prices beyond $100,000.","On that date, Bitcoin mining block rewards get cut in half, thus \u201Chalving\u201D the issuance of new Bitcoin. If the current demand for Bitcoin sustains itself till then, the laws of supply and demand could catalyze some very roomy price rises.","It looks like billionaire Saylor believes there\u2019s a lot more rally left."],"entity":[{"type":"March 11, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1,550","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 8 this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$90 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"13%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$800 Million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$72,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2030","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"42.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$MSTR","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$69,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.625%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$782.0 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$800 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$13 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Michael Saylor","MicroStrategy"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
