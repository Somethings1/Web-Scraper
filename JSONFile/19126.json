By the start of this week, a further $5 million dollars flooded into the project.","The recent gains appear to have been spurred on by Saturday, April 20, a milestone day for the project because it was both Bitcoin\u2019s fourth quadrennial halving and international stoner day.","At the ICO\u2019s conclusion next Monday, there will be an airdrop date announcement that could catalyze some potentially explosive buying in the coming weeks. Beyond that, the team will be eyeing up exchange listings.","So, just how does Slothana differ from its Pepe and Doge-themed predecessors? Well, for a start, this is the first time stoner culture has been properly represented in crypto.","To date, various crypto communities have flirted with 4\/20. The self-styled \u201CDoge Army\u201D that rallies around Dogecoin has appropriated with stoner culture before. It selected April 20 to mark International Doge Day because of its irreverent connotations and instantly memorable appeal.","Slothana doesn\u2019t beat about the herb \u2013 sorry, bush. Coming hot on the heels of the popular Slerf token, Slothana is a sloth chained to a desk. With his hazed red eyes, he\u2019s clockwatching because he knows at 4:20, he\u2019ll get the break he needs.","It may even be quite a big break, with multiple price-driving industry developments inbound this year.","🌿📜 And on the eleventh day before the grand unveiling, Slothana spoke unto its disciples, saying: 'Behold, the countdown draws ever nearer to its end.' 🚀 Let us remain steadfast in our slothful anticipation, for soon shall come the epoch of Slothana's glory. 🦥💫\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/i88c7aDdv6","\u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 18, 2024","","Last Saturday, a Bitcoin software update called \u201Cthe halving\u201D slashed mining rewards from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125. This means miners now need to mine twice as hard as they did before Saturday to get the same rewards.","Since miners control the issuance of new BTC, this has now halved the rate at which new Bitcoin is sold onto the open market. Logically, the depleted supply during Bitcoin\u2019s most popular year yet will serve as a catalyst for mid-term appreciation.","That\u2019s why all three of the previous halvings have resulted in significant rallies well within a year of the update.","And where Bitcoin goes, the rest of the market follows. Virtually every leading cryptocurrency tracked the price movements of Bitcoin, with late February\/early March accounting for some of the steepest gains so far this year across many projects.","In addition to that, Bitcoin is becoming a popular investment product in the US, a strong sign that the same auspicious fate may befall Ethereum and its closest contender, Solana, Slothana\u2019s native blockchain.","Back in January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of 11 Bitcoin ETFs, essentially investment products that enable investors to buy and hold Bitcoin through a regulated vehicle with all the safeguards that entails.","The news helped Bitcoin reach a new all-time high of $73,737.94 about a month ago.","The SEC has until May 23 to return a verdict on the latest round of applications for Ethereum ETFs.","Should the agency greenlight the products \u2013 and there\u2019s very little reason not to, now that Bitcoin ETFs are trading \u2013 that could foment some explosive rallies across not only Ethereum, but also competitor Layer 1 blockchains deploying high-functionality smart contracts, like Solana.","🚀🌕 Prepare for a moonshot as we ready the engines of the Slothship! 🌿🦥 With the launch just around the corner, our slothful crew is gearing up for an epic journey through the crypto cosmos. Buckle up and hold onto your branches, because there's just 6 days to go 🌌🌟\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/yHBrE3NP5x","\u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 22, 2024","","In addition to that, there is a growing gold rush around Slothana\u2019s native network, Solana, as its ecosystem continues to expand.","In recent months, Solana meme coins like Slerf, DogWifHat and Bonk have on good days far outpaced the gains posted by their Ethereum-based rivals Floki, Pepe and Shiba Inu. These successes have spurred investors to look into Slothana\u2019s own $15 million presale as a prime contender for the network\u2019s next viral meme coin.","","This month, Solana developers deployed a mainnet beta update aimed at addressing the network\u2019s congestion problems. This means Solana is the healthiest it has ever been, and its entire ecosystem is primed for a heady ascent this year.","There are less than four days left to join the $SLOTH presale. To do so, investors need a funded SOL wallet to use the contribution widget on the Slothana website.","At its current price, 1 SOL token buys 10,000 $SLOTH. A steal for any investor that sees the upside potential in blockchain\u2019s highest sloth.","Visit and support Slothana here",""],"entity":[{"type":"$73,737.94","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$SLOTH","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"4:20","content":"TIME"},{"type":"April 25, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saturday, April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Slothana","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5 million dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 22, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pepe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 23","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Doge Army","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dogecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Slothana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Slothana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bonk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 18, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$15 million dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"International Doge Day","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Presale","slothana"],"authors":["Gary McFarlane"]}
