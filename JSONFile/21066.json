Tenreiro, Deputy Chief of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit enforcement division urged \u201Cinvestors to continue to exercise extreme caution in this space, as fraudsters exploit the popularity of crypto assets to promise astronomical profits while all too frequently only delivering a crash landing\u201D."],"entity":[{"type":"SafeMoon executives misappropriated millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$5.75 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"98%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SFM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$200 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Thomas Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1934","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Decentralized Finance (DeFi","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Assets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Karony","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"David Hirsch","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SafeMoon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1933","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kyle Nagy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John Karony","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"McClaren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CTO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jorge G.
