Crenshaw was sworn into her position alongside Commissioner Hester M. Peirce (aka \u201CCrypto Mom\u201D) on August 17, 2020. Both have terms that are due to expire on June 5 \u2013 less than 50 days from today.","According to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret, recent White House statements and nominations show no signs that Crenshaw or anyone else has been nominated to fill her position after her term is finished.","ðŸš¨NEW: l got lots of messages yesterday asking if the @GaryGensler resignation rumor was true.","Firstly, it\u2019s an election year and there\u2019s a high possibility these could be his final few months as chairman, a position he likes, so it\u2019s unlikely he would throw in the towel early.\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/DBihpCeLjY","\u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 19, 2024","","\u201CThe White House had no comment on the matter,\u201D Terret said.","The revelation follows rumors earlier this week that SEC chairman Gary Gensler may soon resign after he posted a Twitter thread on Tuesday that read somewhat like a goodbye message.","Several crypto-supportive congressmen, including Tom Emmer, have called on Gensler to resign for his hostile treatment of the industry and failure to adequately protect investors from its true bad actors.","Under his leadership, the agency has filed dozens of enforcement actions against top crypto firms accusing them of securities law violations, while their leaders say the regulator\u2019s evaluation of the law with respect to crypto is both unclear and outdated.","Terret believes the likelihood of Gensler actually resigning during an election year is slim to none, and the odds of finding a nominee to replace him are \u201Cvirtually impossible.\u201D","Crenshaw\u2019s potential exit could be more important for the industry. Unlike Gensler, she voted not to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs for U.S. markets in January even though the agency had already lost a court case on the matter months prior.","\u201CThese Commission actions are unsound and ahistorical,\u201D Crenshaw wrote in a dissenting letter at the time. \u201CAnd worse, they put us on a wayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection.\u201D","The commissioner added that spot Bitcoin ownership is highly concentrated and said the crypto spot markets are a \u201Cpetri dish\u201D of fraudulent conduct.","\u201CIf the technology is so revolutionary, why do so many of its uses seem to revolve around recreating the existing financial system, except with less regulation, more opacity, fewer investor protections, and more risk?\u201D she added."],"entity":[{"type":"Crenshaw","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eleanor Terrett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tom Emmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 5 \u2013 less than 50 days from today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"White House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 17, 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hester M.
