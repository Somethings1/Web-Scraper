But for newer participants, the record highs represent validation of their investment as the cryptocurrency continues to demonstrate resilience. ","","","\u201CThe significance of a new all-time high in dollar terms can\u2019t be understated,\u201D said Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Delphi Digital and former equity analyst at Bloomberg, in a direct message with CoinDesk. \u201CMany skeptics have publicly denounced bitcoin for failing to reach a new high despite such a favorable macro backdrop so this is yet another testament to bitcoin\u2019s staying power.\u201D","","","That favorable backdrop includes, in part, an unprecedented era of spending on the part of central banks around the world to help combat the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. Many bitcoin investors view the digital asset as a hedge against potential inflation from this loose monetary policy.","","","Year to date, bitcoin has gained 167%. Since its yearly lows in March, after crashing more than 50% in a single day, bitcoin has rallied more than 400%. ","","","To be sure, bitcoin\u2019s positive correlation to traditional markets remains somewhat strong above 0.4, according to Coin Metrics, in contrast to a longstanding narrative supported by bitcoin investors that bitcoin is uncorrelated to traditional markets. With regular exchange outages and new investors questioning the reliability of widely circulated market data, moreover, the adolescent market has room to mature.","","","Nevertheless, cryptocurrency analysts depict the ongoing rally as healthy and primed to continue as institutional and retail money steadily flows into bitcoin.\n\nMainstream payment companies like Square and PayPal, for example, continue funneling retail capital into bitcoin. ","","","For Q3, Square reported a record $1 billion in bitcoin revenue via its CashApp mobile wallet. PayPal, after announcing its plan to support bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in October, promptly removed its waitlist for the service less than a month later, citing overwhelming demand. ","","","Institutional demand is also surging, represented in part by record growth in CME Group\u2019s bitcoin futures market, as CoinDesk has reported. Led by high-profile investors like Stanley Druckenmiller, Bill Miller, Paul Tudor Jones and BlackRock\u2019s Rick Rieder, the mainstream financial audience\u2019s thinking about bitcoin is warming significantly as they allocate more and more capital to the leading digital asset. ","","","From a fundamental perspective, the case for a sustained bitcoin rally is as strong as ever, according to Karim Helmy, data analyst at Coin Metrics. The total number of active bitcoin addresses has soared to all-time highs, and the network\u2019s economic density\u2014the value transacted per byte\u2014is nearing levels not seen since the last bull run, he told CoinDesk in a direct message. ","","","Despite tens of thousands of other cryptocurrencies competing for investor mindshare, bitcoin is leaving nearly every one of them behind, with most \u201Caltcoins\u201D still down double-digit percentages from their own record highs. Ether is still down 58% from its all-time high, also set in late 2017. Litecoin and XRP are down 77% and 82% from their respective highs. ","","","Bitcoin\u2019s record high comes amidst a curious lack of publicity, however, from mainstream audiences and media outlets, according to data from The Tie. ","","","The total volume of bitcoin-related tweets, for example, is well below late 2017 levels and largely flat for the past two years. Media mentions also are sitting at conspicuously low levels. Search interest in bitcoin, moreover, sits at less than one fifth the level seen at bitcoin\u2019s 2017 high, according to Google Trends. ","","","\u201CI don\u2019t think many people outside the industry cared until we hit all-time highs,\u201D said Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari, in a direct message with CoinDesk. The coronavirus pandemic and U.S. presidential election have dominated mainstream audiences\u2019 attention in 2020, he noted.","","","As investors look for more upside, any continuation of bitcoin\u2019s rally will be \u201Cdefined by a wider investor base as new market participants are unlocked,\u201D Kelly said.",""],"entity":[{"type":"Square","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CME Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$19,850.11","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Rick Rieder","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Messari","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"82%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kevin Kelly","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Delphi Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"XRP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paul Tudor Jones","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google Trends","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kelly","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stanley Druckenmiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Karim Helmy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"77%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"167%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"400%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"58%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Ryan Watkins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bill Miller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coin Metrics","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Markets"],"authors":["Zack Voell"]}
