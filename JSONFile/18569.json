The publication is committed to a strong legal defense, as it takes its journalistic responsibilities seriously.","Harborne clarified in the lawsuit that while he does have a 12% ownership stake in Bitfinex, it is a result of the company\u2019s reimbursement plan for customers affected by a 2016 hack of the exchange. ","He emphasized that he has never held a management or executive role at Bitfinex or Tether and is merely a minority shareholder.","Last year, WSJ published an article titled \u201CHamas Militants Behind Israel Attack Raised Millions in Crypto,\u201D which alleged that Hamas raised over $130 million in cryptocurrency between August 2021 and June 2022.","The Wall Street Journal article was even referenced by US lawmakers including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who co-signed a letter with over 100 members of Congress urging the White House and Treasury Department to crack down on cryptocurrencies due to their alleged use in funding Hamas operations.","However, blockchain analytics company Elliptic refuted claims that Hamas received millions in crypto donations in the months leading up to its attack on Israel earlier this month.","Elliptic stated in a blog post that there is \u201Cno evidence to support the assertion that Hamas has received significant volumes of crypto donations.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Christopher Harborne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Companies Behind Tether Used Falsified Documents","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Delaware","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shell Companies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"WSJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AML Global Ltd.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"February 21, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"White House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$130 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Treasury Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hamas Militants Behind Israel Attack Raised Millions","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Israel","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Elizabeth Warren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Harborne","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Harborne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hamas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Get Bank Accounts","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitfinex","Lawsuit","Tether"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
