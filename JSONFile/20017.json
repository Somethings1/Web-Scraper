The largest cryptocurrency is now trading at $65,700 during Asia hours on Thursday.","\u201CWow, $IBIT took in a record-smashing $788m yesterday, leading team effort for Nine w\/ nearly $1b in gross flows despite the reverse God candle and way overwhelming $GBTC\u2019s bleed.

Unsurprisingly, the firm entering Bitcoin with a new Spot Bitcoin product has triggered another bull market.","Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin fund has been dethroned and continues to bleed.","\u201C$GBTC has seen almost $10b in outflows yet has the same amount of assets it did on launch day. Seems like magic, but it\u2019s the bull market subsidy and same physics keeping outflow-ridden active equity mutual funds with massive assets still (albeit mirage-y since customers have left but who cares, revenue is still real)\u201D posted Balchunas.","BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF has beaten the GBTC into the ground by attracting huge inflows and superseding as the main trading vehicle for Bitcoin.","\u201CIt\u2019s great to witness from a capital markets perspective that [BlackRock] iShares has superseded and replaced Grayscale\u2019s GBTC from being the main trading vehicle for Bitcoin,\u201D Laurent Kssis, a crypto expert on trading and ETFs at CEC Capital told Cryptonews in an interview.","\u201CWe always said the GBTC product was substandard for institutional investors but the first one to make it on the secondary market through a loophole in the rules to admit products on OTC markets,\u201D explains Kssis.","The IBIT ETF continues to supersede all other products available in the market ranking second among all ETFs in terms of daily, weekly, and monthly flows.","\u201Cbtw for context on relative size of $IBIT\u2019s cash haul, it now ranks 2nd among all ETFs in 1D flow, 1W flow, 1M flow and 3rd in YTD flows.\u201D posted Balchunas on the social media platform, X.","Bitcoin\u2018s resilience shines through as it stages a remarkable recovery. This bounce back, especially after a concerning dip below the $60,000 mark, reignites discussions around Bitcoin price predictions, with many investors and analysts eagerly speculating on the potential for new highs.","As the trading volume soars to nearly $76 billion, the digital currency\u2019s robust performance underscores its unwavering dominance and sustained investor confidence in its long-term value proposition, reports Arslan Butt from Cryptonews."],"entity":[{"type":"BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$788 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$IBIT","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$10 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10b","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CEC Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eric Balchunas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$788m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$65,700","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Laurent Kssis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$69,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$GBTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1b","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$76 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Balchunas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF","GBTC"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
