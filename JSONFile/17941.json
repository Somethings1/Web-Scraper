According to prosecutors cited in the Denver Post, the husband and wife duo then spent a large portion of the funds on a Range Rover, home renovations, cosmetic dentistry, and more.","Meanwhile, the couple knew that INDXcoin was essentially worthless after a report by the auditor Hacken called INDXcoin code \u201Cunsafe, unsecure and riddled with serious technical problems,\u201D and gave it a rating of \u201Czero out of 10.\u201D","Pastors Eli Regalado and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado say God told them to start a crypto currency. $3.2m later, they are being sued by their flock.
