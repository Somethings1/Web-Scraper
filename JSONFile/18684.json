creating a light-hearted by competitive community \u2013 where your fellow holders are your opponents.","Correct calls on the predictive market receive massive $GBTC rewards \u2013 including up to 100% token bonuses!","","Forging a competitive community based on high-stakes Bitcoin price predictions; with backing from major affiliates and influencers poises Green Bitcoin for success in 2024.","As GBTC continues to smash presale phases, don\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to get in early \u2013 with prices increasingly incrementally throughout the presale.","The project\u2019s roadmap is supercharged for the year ahead, with market campaigns planned to launch soon, and the flagship predict-2-earn mechanism on the horizon, not to mention major price pump events like GBTC tier-1 CEX listings.","So if TRUMP doesn\u2019t wet your appetite, join GBTC \u2013 connect with Green Bitcoin on X and Telegram.","Buy $GBTC Here ",""],"entity":[{"type":"$0.0007","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"GBTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.4","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.00002","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.6","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"+50,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2011","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SOL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alkebulan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.3","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Green Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Trump token on SOL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"+700%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.00165","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jeo Boden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"+130%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Green Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"-86%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$178k","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 7, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"+6,500%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"63%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"+100,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$GBTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"TRUMP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"+33,992%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$5m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.005","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Trump","Trump Price Analysis","TRUMP token"],"authors":["Sam Cooling"]}
