Long live Crypto\u2019: Veteran DeFi Developer Andre Cronje Urges More Regulation","category":["DeFi News "],"content":["Â ","\u201CCrypto is dead. Long live Crypto,\u201D the veteran decentralized finance (DeFi) developer and creator of early DeFi protocol Yearn.Finance (YFI), Andre Cronje, opened a new blog post by saying. He went on to argue that more regulation is needed in the space in which he might have earned significant wealth.","Starting the blog post by sharing an anecdote about how coders often believe they can improve on a piece of software before they eventually realize that the original code was the way it was for a reason, Cronje said the same is also true for crypto.","The rules of monetary policy, debt issuance, bonds, derivatives, and other parts of the financial system all \u201Cexist for a reason,\u201D Cronje said, hinting that attempts at changing these rules will prove futile.","\u201CBut crypto is the new generation, the generation of \u2018we can do it better\u2019,\u201D he added.","Further, Cronje wrote that he has long been vocal about his \u201Cdisdain of crypto culture,\u201D and equally vocal about his \u201Clove for crypto ethos.\u201D","\u201CReading that might sound weird,\u201D he said, arguing that crypto ethos is a concept like self-sovereign rights, self-custody, and self-empowerment. \u201CCrypto culture is concepts like wealth, entitlement, enrichment, and ego,\u201D Cronje wrote, before adding:","\u201CCrypto culture has strangled crypto ethos.\u201D","According to Cronje, the greed that he sees permeating the crypto industry can only be controlled through regulation. There is a necessity, he argued, for regulating the industry, \u201Cnot as a mechanism to prevent\u201D (presumably the existence of the space and\/or its development), but to serve \u201Cas a mechanism to protect\u201D users.","Lastly, Cronje said that he sees \u201Ca new blockchain economy\u201D on the horizon, but noted that this will be \u201Cdriven by trust, not trustlessness,\u201D and that greed will be kept at bay by new regulations.","\u201CThere is an irony in having come full circle, yet I find myself more excited than ever. I won\u2019t step foot into the badlands again, but I\u2019m vastly excited about this new future,\u201D wrote the developer, who in March said that he is leaving the crypto space.","The article was noticed by members of the crypto and DeFi community, with many appearing critical of Cronje\u2019s stance towards the space, using as an argument the amount of money he has earned from it before leaving.","Crypto is dead after I made 9 figures shilling my shitcoins\n\nðŸ¤¡ https:\/\/t.co\/YqG9GjX1Lz","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Fantom, Other DeFi Tokens Shaken as Top DeFi Developer Andre Cronje Quits\n\u2013 YFI Rallies 80% in a Week as Team Promises \u2018Aggressive Buybacks\u2019\n\n\u2013 DeFi Trends in 2022: Growing Interest, Regulation & New Roles for DAOs, DEXes, NFTs, and Gaming\n\u2013 Another Regulatory Challenge for DeFi\n\n\u2013 Major Fintech Firm FIS Partners with Fireblocks to Bring DeFi and Crypto to Institutions\n\u2013 DeFi and Blockchain \u2018Are Real\u2019 \u2013 JPMorgan CEO\n\n\u2013 DeFi Could Rely On CBDC, But More Bridges With Centralized Finance Are Needed \u2013 Expert Panel\n\u2013 DeFi \u2018Crucial\u2019 for Financial Inclusion, CBDCs Still Welcome Despite Being Centralized"],"entity":[{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fantom","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Andre Cronje","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Financial Inclusion","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fintech Firm FIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cronje","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Cryptocurrency","DeFi","Regulation"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
