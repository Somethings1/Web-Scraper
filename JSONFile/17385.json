After three consecutive \u201Cjumbo\u201D rate hikes of 0.75 percentage points each, the Federal Reserve finally announced another rate increase on Wednesday, this one a full 0.75 percentage points higher in an effort to slow inflation. ","#Breaking | The US Federal Reserve hikes rates by 75 bps.\n\nThis is its fourth hike in a row of that caliber, as it battles high inflation.#Fed #FederalReserve #75bpsHike pic.twitter.com\/GHNLMwsg19","While a rise in interest rates can reduce inflation by discouraging consumers from taking on new debt, it will also increase the debt service payments of Americans who are already struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living, which includes food, clothing, and shelter. ","The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates by 0.75 percentage points in its ongoing fight against inflation.","The markets reacted negatively when Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a rationale for halting the increases by saying it was \u201Cextremely premature\u201D to discuss a pause.","#US core #inflation highest since 1982\u2026\nKey inflation measure climbs to 40-year high as Fed efforts ring futile and shoppers brace for more pain https:\/\/t.co\/vPoGN491gC via @businessinsider","Consumer Price Index numbers show that year-over-year inflation has remained persistently high, falling from a June high of 9.1% to 8.2% as of September. That\u2019s far more than the 2% inflation target set by the government.","Important things to remember:","At its December 2022 meeting, the Fed could decide to make lesser interest rate hikes than the quick three-quarter point moves. However, it\u2019s likely to increase rates more than expected.","Moreover, Mr. Powell has made it clear that as inflation has proven surprisingly persistent, the route toward an economic soft landing has become narrower.","The market\u2019s takeaway from his statement was clear: \u201CI would like folks to realize our commitment to getting this done.\u201D","Bitcoin\u2019s reaction to the rate hike has been quite mixed, with BTC surging to test a strong resistance level of $20,800 but failing to break above this level. It eventually fell to trade at $20,200. CoinMarketCap is currently first, with a $389 billion live market capitalization. ","The BTC\/USD pair is currently trading bearish after breaching a strong support level of $20,330. Closing candles below this level will almost certainly result in a strong selling trend in BTC. In addition, the upward trendline that was supporting BTC near $20,300 has been broken. ","For the time being, Bitcoin is likely to continue its downward trend until it reaches the $19,984 level.","The MACD and RSI have also entered the selling zone, so investors should look for sell trades below $20,330. A bullish breakout of $20,330, on the other hand, could expose the BTC price to the $20,800 or $21,270 level.","With the news that more than $4 million was raised in the Dash 2 Trade presale, the company has also confirmed that LBANK Exchange would be the first CEX to sell the D2T token. ","Less than two weeks after launching its public token sale, it has reached these benchmarks, indicating growing interest from investors in its trading intelligence platform.","Upon completion of the second of nine presale phases, Dash 2 Trade (D2T) will be listed on LBANK Exchange. It is anticipated that this will occur in the first quarter of 2023 upon the release of Dash 2 Trade, a cutting-edge dashboard, and intelligence platform.","D2T has captured the attention of cryptocurrency investors all over the world, raising more than $4.2 million in a week during its presale. Furthermore, presales have recently been brisk, and D2T is well-positioned to capitalize on the trend.","Visit Dash 2 Trade now",""],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1982","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$20,800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$20,300","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.75 percentage points","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$20,200","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"LBANK Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MACD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the first quarter of 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"9.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"8.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$4.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$389 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$20,330","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$19,984","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jerome Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"December 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$21,270","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","BTC\/USD"],"authors":["Arslan Butt"]}
