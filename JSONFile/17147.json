As previously reported, GRAC\u2019s last blockchain gaming intervention was met with great disdain by the crypto and blockchain community, as well as gaming giants. Last year, the gaming regulator refused to issue the domestic gaming firm NodeBrick with a rating for a game called Infinity Star, effectively blocking its release.","The move provoked one industry expert into stating at the time,","\u201CIf NFT items are a problem, blockchain gaming\u2019s death warrant has already been signed.\u201D","GRAC appears to be concerned that NFTs can be traded for crypto, and thus converted to fiat, using networks such as Ethereum.","South Korea\u2019s partial crypto crackdown, issued in early 2018, has apparently eased in recent months, with one major blockchain gaming player telling Cryptonews.com,","\u201CRegulations will change in parallel with industry development and it will move in a direction that will prove to be comparatively moderate.\u201D","GRAC\u2019s latest move appears to run contrary to this, however.","iNews24 reports that SkyPeople, the developer of Five Stars, launched its bid for ratings approval with the regulator over a month ago, and has complied with multiple requests to provide GRAC with additional data on \u201Cblockchain functions.\u201D It usually takes 15 days for GRAC to complete ratings issuance procedures.","SkyPeople described the process as \u201Cfrustrating,\u201D although the firm\u2019s case is not yet a lost cause \u2013 as the regulator stated that it needs more time to deliberate, rather than issuing a flat refusal.","However, the same media outlet claimed that \u201Cvirtually no\u201D blockchain gaming titles have received GRAC ratings as of yet. Although South Korean firms can seek to issue their offerings on international platforms such as the Google Play Store, SkyPeople said,","\u201CWe want to respect the systems used by government agencies so that we can legally provide services in accordance with domestic gaming laws and regulations.\u201D","It is perhaps ironic that Kakao\u2019s own blockchain subsidiary so recently spoke of creating a \u201Cdigital assets\u201D trading \u201Cecosystem\u201D built around Klaytn, making reference to NFTs, at a recent event hosted by the government\u2019s tech agency.\n___\nLearn more:\n\u2018First True Litecoin Game\u2019 Is an RPG Knights and Wizard-fest\nLegend of Mir Developer Plays For Success In Blockchain Gaming Market"],"entity":[{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Administration Committee (GRAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"GRAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blockchain Gaming Market","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Klaytn","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Infinity Star","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SkyPeople","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Gaming","Non-fungible tokens","Regulation","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
