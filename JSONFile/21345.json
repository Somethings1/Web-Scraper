Ethereum, the second-largest crypto, also tumbled by more than 16% to $1,200. Polygon\u2019s Matic has suffered the most among the top ten, losing around 20% over the past day. ","Bitfinex market analysts said in a comment to Cryptonews.com that the recent developments in the crypto space would further exacerbate the sentiment around Bitcoin, which was already in the crosshairs of whipsaw trading.","\u201CIn a space battered by a spate of high-profile failures this year markets are likely to remain turbulent until traders steady their nerves. A backdrop of looming rate hikes and a deteriorating global economy is only adding to super bearish sentiment,\u201D the analysts said.","FTX earned itself a reputation as crypto\u2019s bail-out king during the recent crypto meltdown. The platform generously offered to bail out some troubled digital currency platforms, putting up millions of dollars in a revolving line of credit.","However, in a strange turn of events, the exchange allegedly become insolvent and had to sell its distressed assets to a competitor. \u201CWe have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for FTX.com,\u201D FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in a tweet. ","Binance CEO CZ added more details. \u201CFTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire FTX.com,\u201D he said. \n\nBut how did things reach here?","On November 2, CoinDesk reported that it had gained access to Alameda Research\u2019s balance sheet, claiming that the firm, which has close ties to FTX, was loaded with the exchange\u2019s native exchange token FTT. Most of the other holdings were in illiquid assets, meaning there was not enough money to cash out if need be.","Subsequently, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced that the exchange, which held 23 million FTX tokens worth about $529 million at the time, had decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on its books. ","The news led to sell pressure on FTT increasing, with the coin plunging from its daily high of $22. \n\nIt then became apparent that Binance was looking to acquire FTX, upon which the markets rallied briefly before continuing their decline as no deal was set in stone. ","\u201CThe fear that Alameda\u2019s shoddy balance sheet was commingled with FTX\u2019s led to a liquidity crisis and ultimately to today\u2019s offer by CZ to acquire the exchange,\u201D said crypto veteran Jonathon Wu, adding that there is \u201Ca seeming multi-billion dollar hole at FTX.\u201D","Now there's a seeming multi-billion dollar hole at FTX, and Sam, the previous lender of last resort, has had to turn to CZ for help.\n\nThere is a new king in crypto.","It now remains to be seen whether the Binance deal goes through. However, if recent price action anything to go by, it\u2019s safe to say markets participants are not looking hopeful."],"entity":[{"type":"Matic","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$22","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"November 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1,200","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fried","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$529 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$18,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jonathon Wu","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Changpeng Zhao","FTX","Sam Bankman-Fried"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
