These transactions will take place in exchange for cash,\u201D it wrote in the filing.","\u201CSubject to the in-kind regulatory approval, these transactions may also take place in exchange for bitcoin.\u201D","The choice between in-kind and cash redemption models for spot bitcoin ETFs has potential implications for the fund\u2019s overall cost. ","Most ETFs employ the in-kind redemption model, enabling issuers to swap the ETF\u2019s underlying assets with a market maker rather than conducting transactions in cash. ","The cash redemption model, which incurs higher transaction costs, could potentially make the product more expensive for investors, according to Bryan Armour, an ETF analyst at Morningstar.","Speculating on the SEC\u2019s motive behind the cash redemption requirement, Armour suggests that the commission may not want broker-dealers to directly handle bitcoin. ","By enforcing cash redemption and having the fund trade cash for bitcoin, the SEC can maintain oversight of the entire process from the exchange to the fund, even if broker-dealers are barred from handling the crypto asset.","BlackRock and Grayscale had previously presented an in-kind redemption model to the SEC, while Hashdex, a Brazilian crypto investment firm, had proposed a cash redemption model. ","However, Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, believes that the decision to enforce cash redemptions is not a make-or-break factor for launching the first spot bitcoin ETFs. ","\u201CFrom a 30,000-foot view, what matters is, do we have an ETF? Or do we not have an ETF? And all these nuances are, are we on the 95 yard line?\u201D he said.  "],"entity":[{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hashdex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Matt Hougan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bryan Armour","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitwise Asset Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Morningstar","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Armour","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["ARK Invest","Bitcoin ETF","Blackrock"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
