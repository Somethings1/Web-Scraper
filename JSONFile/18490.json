She has repeatedly categorized crypto assets as a tool for money laundering and terrorist financing. Warren has been a longstandingÂ advocate of cracking down on the cryptocurrency industry. Particularly after reports surfaced that Hamas had access to crypto wallets leading up to their October attack on Israel."],"entity":[{"type":"Coinbase","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Winklevoss Twins","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fairshake","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Payward Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kraken crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Israel","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cameron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Federal Election Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 18, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Elizabeth Warren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2.45 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Electric Capital Partners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$6.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gemini Earn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tyler Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$500,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Hamas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cameron Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$4.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$78 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$750,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["PAC","US Senators","Winklevoss Twins"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
