{"summary":"Arthur Hayes has been many things to crypto over the years: a builder, a showman and a criminal.

But that\u2019s like calling a butterfly a caterpillar or a chicken an egg.","Since Hayes\u2019 days as a banker he\u2019s lived a thousand lives. He founded the first bitcoin derivatives exchange in 2014, invented the perpetual swap, became crypto\u2019s first African American billionaire, lost vast portions of his wealth and made it back in at least two crypto crashes, allegedly \u201Cran the stops\u201D on his users (his users said, without much evidence), traveled the world speaking on crypto\u2019s conference circuit, once joked on stage about bribing a Seychelles financial regulator \u201Cwith a coconut,\u201D was said to have run the stops some more, was accused of facilitating money laundering by U.S. federal regulators, was sued by investors, was sued by customers, may have been in Singapore, surrendered to authorities in Hawaii, was put under house arrest and has now \u2013 somehow, inexplicably \u2013 rebuilt his reputation as a crypto sage by writing multi-thousand-word blog posts.","Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022","Arthur Hayes has been many things to crypto over the years: a builder, a showman and a criminal. This year, as the industry collapsed around users, he\u2019s been a wise commentator able to bring people through complex topics in the markets and business in a series of blog posts. He\u2019s like Virgil leading pilgrims through the layers of Hell as each new month brings a fresh calamity.","In this sense, Hayes is also living proof of something in crypto called the \u201Credemption arc,\u201D where former villains become heroes. For better or worse, crypto has embraced more than its fair share of convicted felons and fraudsters. Not everyone will welcome back FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried or Three Arrows Capital co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu (who at least appear to be avoiding regulators, a bit like how Hayes was perceived at first). But even convicted fraudsters can earn a seat at the table if they know how to make money.","Hayes, for instance, was invited to deliver the farewell keynote at CoinDesk\u2019s inaugural I.D.E.A.S. conference. He had pleaded guilty along with BitMEX co-founders Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in February and is still under two years\u2019 probation. Despite the conditions, Hayes said crypto is still generating new visions and isn\u2019t done innovating, even if it takes time to build back from the bear market.","He didn\u2019t say a word about the banking system.","CORRECTION (12\/5\/22 \u2013 20:00 UTC): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Arthur Hayes spent time in prison, claimed to have bribed a regulator with a coconut and refused to engage with criminal investigators.
