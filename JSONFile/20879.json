The index measures how diluted or concentrated a given collection is, and it indicates the number of pieces that are owned by the top 10 wallets for a given collection.","They found that the studied CryptoPunk whales are heavily focused on Larva Labs collections, as they do not own any other crypto assets besides Art Blocks, at 427 NFTs, CryptoPunks, with 1,410 cryptoassets, and Meebits, which are also developed by Larva Labs, at 1,329 NFTs, according to the analysis.","CryptoPunk whales hold the most valuable portfolios on average, with USD 53.6m, followed by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Art Blocks whales with an average of some USD 11.5m.","Pudgy Penguins and BAYC are among the best-distributed collections in the NFT space. Similarly, Cool Cats whales also tend to display diversified NFT strategies.","And while CryptoPunks whales are the less diversified group, BAYC whales \u2013 in contrast to Larva Labs whales \u2013 appear to have a very diversified NFT investment strategy, said the report. Besides BAYC and Bored Apes Kennel Club, Bored Ape whales have \u201Csignificant holdings\u201D in Art Blocks and Meebits. Also, 40% of BAYC whales have at least one CryptoPunk in their collection, DappRadar said, adding that:","\u201CCollections like the BAYC and Art Blocks whose average price increased significantly as of late, are being used as a way to obtain profits. Whilst Art Block whales prefer to re-invest in their preferred collection, BAYC whales are looking to discover the new NFT gem by diversifying their holdings.\u201D","Art Blocks whales have \u201Cimportant holdings\u201D in CryptoPunks and Meebits, collectively owning 211 and 414 pieces respectively, it added. Furthermore, \u201CPudgy Penguins appear to be liked by these whales as 202 Penguins are also owned by Art Block whales.\u201D","Whales who own Axie Infinity collectibles are mostly focused on gaming NFTs, and only two of such whales own diversified NFT collectibles portfolios.","To DappRadar, BAYC looks like the healthiest collection in terms of market manipulation owing to a low whale concentration index and an impressive market capitalization of USD 1.1bn.","\u201CIn regards to the six collections analyzed, there is no concern about market manipulation,\u201D said the report. \u201CThose collections that may lean towards a more concentrated supply like the Larva Labs projects are already established as premier NFT collections hence the risk is significantly reduced.\u201D","","Newer collections like the Pudgy Penguins \u201Cmay be at a higher manipulation risk,\u201D although their concentration metrics show a well distributed project despite a recent launch, DappRadar concluded.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 NFT Sector Far from Dead or Even Resting, Exploding Across the Board\n\u2013 Cryptoverse Reacts: Visa May Become \u201CFront-End for Ethereum\u201D, NFT Sales Explode","\u2013 Non-Fungible Penguins Are Taking Over the NFT Scene\n\u2013 Buterin to Star in Mila Kunis\u2019 NFT Animated Series \u2013 with Jane Fonda","\u2013 Sotheby\u2019s Record CryptoPunk Auction Sees a Wave of New Bidders\n\u2013 NFT Traders: \u2018Christie\u2019s F***ed up USD 17m CryptoPunks Sale\u2019"],"entity":[{"type":"Larva Labs","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sotheby\u2019s Record CryptoPunk Auction","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201CPudgy Penguins","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Larva Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bored Ape Yacht Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"DappRadar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD 11.5m.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DappRadar","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jane Fonda","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bored Apes Kennel Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mila Kunis","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Art","Ethereum","NFT","Non-fungible tokens"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
