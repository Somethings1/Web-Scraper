It saw a total of 8 million downloads worldwide.","As of September, it is collaborating with SYMBIOGENESIS, an NFT art project created by the Japanese gaming giant Square Enix \u2013 the publisher of massive hits, including Final Fantasy.","The third game is Cursed Stone, a 3D open-world MMORPG. It allows players to own their assets fully and to trade them freely. They can trade the entire characters, all levels, and all items in one transaction.","Its developers want to explore the possibilities of combining NFT and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies.","Launched in 2018, the Sidney-based Immutable seeks to make it easy for developers and game studios to build and launch games on Ethereum.","It provides multiple zk-based scaling options, including Immutable zkEVM, powered by Polygon, and Immutable X, a rollup based on StarkWare technology.","Michael Powell, Product Marketing Lead at Immutable, told Cryptonews that,","\u201CZK and zkEVM play pivotal roles in blockchain gaming by addressing critical issues related to scalability, transaction efficiency, and user experience.\u201D","Traditional layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, he said, are plagued by scalability bottlenecks and high gas fees, making it nearly impossible for blockchain games to achieve mass adoption.","ZK technology, however, compresses transaction data and executes smart contracts off-chain while ensuring data validity on layer 1.","\u201CThis results in faster and more cost-effective gameplay.\u201D","The zkEVM, Powell says, is an extension of this concept. It enables the execution of smart contracts on Ethereum with minimal on-chain interactions.","This improves the scalability and performance of blockchain games.","By the end of this decade, Immutable anticipates \u201Ca transformative evolution in blockchain gaming,\u201D with Powell stating that,","\u201CThe industry is poised to break free from its current limitations and reach a broader audience. With the maturation of zkEVM tech and the emergence of dedicated application-specific blockchains, we foresee blockchain gaming becoming synonymous with gaming. Players will enjoy seamless, cost-effective experiences with no compromise on security, asset ownership, and interoperability.\u201D","Game studios that have already committed to building their Web3 games on Immutable zkEVM include Shardbound, SimWin Sports, Space Nation, S369, Moongaming, Sandbox, Eyeball Games, and Magmabyte.","Powell shared that,","\u201CMany large studios are set to launch potential hits on Immutable in the coming months.\u201D","Powel argued that the current state of blockchain gaming is \u201Coptimistic but still largely unproven.\u201D","He stated that,","\u201CWhile blockchain games have gained traction, many in the gaming industry are still waiting on the first breakout hit.\u201D","Blockchain gaming is characterized by a rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps) that offer unique gameplay experiences, digital asset ownership, and play-to-earn incentives \u2013 but the same old user experience and scalability issues remain.","High gas fees and industry fragmentation are additional factors that stand in the way of mass user adoption.","That said, \u201Cthe web3 gaming industry is reaching an inflection point,\u201D Powel opined. Novel Layer 2 (L2) solutions and zkEVM technology will make blockchain games appealing to the masses.","\u201CCollaboration between blockchain gaming companies and AAA game studios will also introduce blockchain features to a broader audience. Ultimately, a combination of improved technology and user-friendly experiences will pave the way for mass user adoption in blockchain gaming.\u201D","More factors will contribute to mass adoption: user-friendly onboarding processes, industry-wide liquidity, and plug-and-play product integrations to make blockchain gaming more approachable, Powell concluded."],"entity":[{"type":"Space Nation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shardbound","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wanxiang Blockchain","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eyeball Games","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alibaba Cloud","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Immutable","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Australia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Magmabyte","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AAA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Powel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Moongaming","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Disney China","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"end of this decade","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Square Enix","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Disney China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sidney","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cryptonews","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sandbox","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Andrew Sorokovsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"VP of Global Business Development","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Near Field Communication (NFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Blockchain","Decentralization","Gaming","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Web3"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
