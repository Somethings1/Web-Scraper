At 08:18 UTC, it trades at USD 56,205 and is down by 10% in a day, erasing all its weekly and monthly gains.","The majority of other coins from the top 10 list are down by 10%-20%, while the hottest token of this week, dogecoin (DOGE) is down by 8%, trimming its weekly gains to 354%, and trading at USD 0.29.","The selloff coincided with rumored and unconfirmed claims by a popular Twitter account, FXHedge, that tweeted that the US Treasury may crack down on money laundering that\u2019s carried out using cryptocurrencies.","Long liquidations have become more numerous this year. With bitcoin (and other coins) breaking all-time highs nearly every passing week, some traders may feel unable to gain significant exposure without margin trading. However, a growing number of traders can\u2019t afford to maintain their leveraged positions in the event of dips. Hence, the growing frequency of big liquidations.","Leveraged trading refers to borrowing funds so that you can take a larger position than you would be able to with your existing funds so that you can potentially generate a higher profit. However, while margin trading enables traders to amplify their returns, it can also lead to increased losses and liquidations, which is why experienced traders tend to advise newcomers to stay away from leveraged trading.","___","___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Traders Issue Warnings as Altcoins are Booming and Bitcoin Consolidates\n\u2013 Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s ATH Was Driven by Relatively Small Demand \u2013 Analyst\n\u2013 Bitcoin Is More \u2018Public\u2019 Money than Central Bank-Issued Fiat Currencies\n\u2013 With Banks Turning to Bitcoin, Is It Finally Time to Long the Bankers?\n\u2013 Coinbase Listing Won\u2019t Help Bitcoin Price \u2013 Analyst\n\u2013 Bitcoin Faces Hedge Test Amid Rising Inflation Concerns\n\u2013 Bitcoin Market Changed \u2018Radically\u2019 & Volatility Decline Attracts Institutions\n\u2013 Bitcoin to Be Worth Millions by 2023, ETH Above USD 2K by 2022 \u2013 Kraken CEO\n\u2013 Institutions & Retail Compete For Bitcoin \u2013 Whose Hands Are Stronger?\n___\n(Updated at 08:53 UTC with a chart and reactions.)"],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"354%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kraken CEO\n\u2013 Institutions & Retail Compete For Bitcoin \u2013 Whose Hands","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Market Changed \u2018Radically\u2019 & Volatility Decline Attracts Institutions\n\u2013 Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Bitcoin","Dogecoin","Market"],"authors":["Linas Kmieliauskas"]}
