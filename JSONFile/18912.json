Since then, the authorities have implemented a new regulatory regime for centralized exchanges, allowing licensed platforms to accept retail investors.","Only two companies have received licenses, and nine are awaiting application approvals.","Rebecca Miller, human trafficking program coordinator for the UN Office on Drugs and Crime regional office for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, commented that the growing awareness of the scam centers in Southeast Asia has forced the crime syndicates to search for victims elsewhere, targeting countries and regions where most people may not yet know about them, according to VOA.","This includes crypto scammers as well, among a variety of others.","Troy Gochenour, a US resident who fell victim to a crypto scam run out of Southeast Asia, says the syndicates are successful in finding new markets. Gochenour now investigates such scams for the Global Anti-Scam Organization, a group founded in Singapore and based in the US.","\u201CI have talked to victims in South America, the Middle East, all over Europe, Australia,\u201D he said, and added:","\u201CNo victims in Antarctica yet, but give it time.\u201D","Gochenour claims that these scam syndicates are \u201Ctruly global.\u201D \u201CWhen you\u2019ve got 100,000 or so people all over Southeast Asia [each] sending out 1,000 or so random messages a day, they\u2019re going to hit a lot of people.\u201D","But Southeast Asia\u2019s online scam hubs are increasingly drawing attention from governments and law enforcement agencies globally as the scammers expand their operations to other regions.","Jason Tower, Myanmar country director for the United States Institute of Peace, a US government-funded think tank, said most countries have been slow to respond to the growing threat. He said, however, that countries are likely to come out with their own sanctions.","Gochenour said he is skeptical that targeted sanctions like the British actions will be very successful. \u201CIt\u2019s really going to boil down to [\u2026] more law enforcement being trained how to deal with it and how to trace cryptocurrencies and freeze them and to seize them. That is the best thing that can happen [for] a [scam] victim.\u201D","He noted Tether\u2019s announcement that it was onboarding the US Secret Service and FBI as a positive development, stating he hopes others follow suit.","The Bybit crypto exchange rolled out a zero-fee structure for its peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform.","Per the press release, this policy \u201Ceradicates fees for both buyers and sellers, unlocking greater savings and maximizing profits for traders globally.\u201D","Bybit\u2019s zero-fee approach applies to all fiat trading pairs on the P2P platform, it said."],"entity":[{"type":"Global Anti-Scam Organization","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Troy Gochenour","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hong Kong Monetary Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FinTech Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States Institute of Peace","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pacific","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US Secret Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VOA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Australia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Neil Tan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Southeast Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Rebecca Miller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Antarctica","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Myanmar","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South China Morning Post","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tsunami Advisors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UN Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["ETF","Hong Kong","Investment"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
