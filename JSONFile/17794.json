The cryptocurrency, currently trading around $60,800, experienced a modest drop of about 1.50% over the last day, keeping the bitcoin price prediction bearish.","This market movement aligns closely with remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, as reported by financial journalist Walter Bloomberg, indicating that rate cuts are not seen as necessary this year.","FED\u2019S BOWMAN: DOESN\u2019T SEE RATE CUTS AS WARRANTED THIS YEAR","\u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) May 10, 2024","","These comments from a Fed official have injected a note of caution into the market, moderating expectations that had been buoyed by the possibility of looser monetary policy.","With this backdrop, investors are closely monitoring further economic updates to gauge potential shifts in Fed strategy that could influence Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics in the upcoming months.","Bitcoin (BTC\/USD) is trading at $60,800, marking a decline of around 1.50% over the last 24 hours. Given this slight decline, the market seems concerned about Bitcoin price prediction.","Yet, BTC continues to be the most valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about $1.2 trillion. The trading volume within this period has reached a substantial $22 billion, reflecting the high level of activity in the Bitcoin market.","From a technical perspective, Bitcoin\u2019s key pivot point is $60,975. Immediate resistance is found at $63,400, with further barriers at $65,050 and $67,160. These levels will need to be surpassed for Bitcoin to regain bullish momentum.","Conversely, immediate support lies at $59,075. If this level fails to hold, subsequent support levels at $56,640 and $54,400 will become the focal points for potential bearish pressure.","The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 38, suggesting a potential oversold condition but also indicating that there might be further downside if market sentiment does not improve. Moreover, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), positioned at $62,151, is providing significant resistance.","In summary, Bitcoin currently shows a bearish trend as it trades below the critical pivot point of $60,975. Maintaining this position might result in additional decreases, potentially reaching the support level of $59,075.","","","Dogeverse, the rapidly expanding meme coin network that spans multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, and soon Solana, Base, and Avalanche, has made a notable splash in the cryptocurrency world. The project has successfully raised over $15 million, surpassing its initial goal of just under $13 million. Currently priced at $0.00031, Dogeverse is set for a price increase in less than a day.","This broad expansion aims to blend the popular Doge appeal with superior blockchain capabilities, promising greater utility and wider adoption. With the launch imminent, this is your last chance to invest in Dogeverse at the current rate.","","For more updates and to engage with the community, follow Dogeverse\u2019s official channels on Twitter and Telegram.","",""],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$67,160","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$63,400","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Base","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$60,975","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$13 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$54,400","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Walter Bloomberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$65,050","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 10, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dogeverse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dogeverse","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1.50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$62,151","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$22 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.2 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$59,075","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$60,800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"last day","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$56,640","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michelle Bowman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$0.00031","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","bitcoin news"],"authors":["Arslan Butt"]}
