It\u2019s a meme coin that is solely about the meme.","That means its only value proposition for investors is the prospect of future price rises.","However, for those who believe in crypto\u2019s longevity, a new generation of meme coins is cropping up which bring bundles of utility along with laughs.","One of the finest representatives of this new generation of coins is WienerAI.","$WAI is a brand new meme token andÂ AI companion that may yield some potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.","Thousands of people are bringing WIENER into their lives.","Will you join them?","ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤– pic.twitter.com\/xmm2XFP3dQ","\u2014 WienerAI (@WienerDogAI) May 12, 2024","","The presale is only a month old, and it has already attracted $1.6 million in investments.","Touted as a \u201CRevolutionary AI Trading partner\u201D, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.","The WienerAI smart contract wasÂ audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms.Â Around 20% of $WAI\u2019s supply is for staking.","WienerAI\u2019s websiteÂ encouragesÂ buyersÂ to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 660% APY.","Stay on top of WienerAI news over onÂ XÂ andÂ Telegram.","Join the presale now over onÂ the WienerAI website.",""],"entity":[{"type":"last 24 hours","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinsult","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.00001064","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mondays ago","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$WAI","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$0.0103","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$DOGE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$BOME","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Pepe Coin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 12, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"8.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pepe Coin (","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$0.058771","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.1428","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"the second half of April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$PEPE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 14","content":"DATE"},{"type":"18%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"660%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"26%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"last fortnight","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$0.000004","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Pepe","pepe coin","wienerai"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
