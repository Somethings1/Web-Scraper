The quadrennial halving is when miner rewards are reduced, slowing the rate of growth in bitcoin supply.","Benchmark raised its MicroStrategy price target to $1,875 from $990 while maintaining its buy rating. The new price target is based on the assumption that bitcoin will reach $150,000 by the end of 2025, up from $125,000 previously. MicroStrategy shares rose more than 11% to around $1,601 in trading before the official open of U.S. markets.","\u201CWhile the upcoming bitcoin halving will create a supply shock as the previous ones had, we believe the event\u2019s impact could be magnified by the concurrent demand shock created by the emergence of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs),\u201D Palmer wrote, adding that \u201Cwe expect inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs to grow dramatically once institutions begin to invest in them in earnest.\u201D","MicroStrategy has a unique business model based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. The company is expected to continue to add to its bitcoin stash using proceeds from capital markets transactions and excess cash generated by its enterprise software business, the report said.","Benchmark estimates that the company will hold 298,246 bitcoins by year-end 2025, up from the 214,246 coins it owned as of March 19.","Rival broker BTIG said the software developer\u2019s implied premium to bitcoin is supported by investors who want exposure to digital assets but may be unable to invest directly in the cryptocurrency or ETFs, and also supported by the company\u2019s ability to accretively raise capital to purchase additional BTC, it wrote in a report on Friday.","Read more: MicroStrategy\u2019s Implied Premium to Bitcoin Settling Into New Norm, BTIG Says","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"$1,875","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1,601","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Palmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$150,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$125,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2012","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"11%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"earnest","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$990","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mark Palmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["MicroStrategy","Analyst Ratings","stock prices"],"authors":["Will Canny"]}
