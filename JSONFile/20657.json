Meme coins are notoriously difficult to analyze and are mainly driven by hype trader sentiment.","\u201CThe birth of Dogecoin was originally a joke,\u201D commented Kevin He, chief operating officer at fintech firm CloudTech Group., and added: ","\u201CWe believe that cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, which are completely useless and the value is purely supported by the community, will not gain value in the future.\u201D ","Looking at the average of the panelists\u2019 specific price predictions, however, the coin, which is currently ranked 10th by market capitalization, could still stay afloat and even rise in price over the next few years.","By the end of the year, the average response indicated a DOGE price of USD 0.08, while USD 0.19 and USD 0.64 are seen as likely price targets for the end of 2025 and 2030, respectively.","Gavin Smith, general partner of crypto hedge fund Panxora, explained the coin\u2019s persistent popularity by saying that,","\u201CWhile DOGE was launched as a joke coin it has subsequently developed a large and loyal community. Detractors of the token forget that community is at least as important as uniqueness in the crypto space.\u201D ","Others, such as non-fungible token (NFT) project MetaTope co-founder Walker Holmes, also pointed to the strong community around the coin.","\u201CThis is with the foresight of Elon [Musk] sticking with the project, Doge has a great community but little utility. Doge has the ability to attract a culture of content creators and creatives,\u201D he said.","Finder.com\u2019s latest price prediction for dogecoin is markedly more bearish on the short-term than an earlier prediction from January, when the panel said the coin is likely to reach USD 0.16 by the end of this year and USD 0.32 by the end of 2025. ","For the end of 2030, however, the panel was more bearish back then, predicting a price of USD 0.54.","The majority of the panel \u2013 or 71% \u2013 said they think it\u2019s time to get out of DOGE and sell. 24% said investors should hold onto what they have, while only 4% said it\u2019s time to buy.","At 12:52 UTC on Friday, DOGE traded at USD 0.0677, up 2.1% for the day and down 3.2% for the week. It\u2019s also up nearly 3% in a month, down 68% in a year, and down almost 91% since its May 2021 all-time high. ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin Could Fall to USD 13.6K This Year, Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again\n\u2013 Volatile Months Ahead for Ethereum & USD 1,711 Likely for Year-End, Says Crypto Industry Panel\n\n\u2013 BNB to Grow Modestly This Year, Might Tripple by 2025 \u2013 Analyst Panel\n\u2013 Little Upside for Solana This Year, But Long-Term Future Remains Bright, Panel Predicts\n\n\u2013 Cardano Price to End Year at USD 0.63, Increasingly Bearish Panel Predicts\n\u2013 Global Economic Growth Slows Amid Gloomy and More Uncertain Outlook"],"entity":[{"type":"Increasingly Bearish Panel Predicts\n\u2013 Global Economic Growth Slows Amid Gloomy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"3.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"fintech","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Panel Predicts\n\n\u2013 Cardano Price","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2030","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Earth","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gavin Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"91%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crypto Industry Panel\n\n\u2013 BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"55%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again\n\u2013 Volatile Months Ahead for Ethereum & USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"71%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Panxora","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Walker Holmes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"24%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"68%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kevin He","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CloudTech Group.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon [Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Dogecoin","Forecast","Market","Survey"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
