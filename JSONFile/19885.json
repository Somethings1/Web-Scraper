Each risked USD 1m on the bet.","LUNA, which was trading above USD 80 just days ago, has tumbled after a wave of sell-off resulted in the ecosystem\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin UST losing its dollar peg.","At 14:41 UTC, the 33rd coin by market capitalization has lost a whopping 85% over the past 24 hours alone, trading at USD 4.37. However, it recovered from the USD 0.83, that was reached earlier today.","Do Kown took the bet after Sensei Algod called LUNA and UST a \u201Cponzi\u201D that can only function as long as there is more demand for the tokens than there is supply.","\u201CThe moment either a blackswan event happens or supply>demand it will be a race to the bottom and luna orderbooks wont be able to hold the billions in selling pressure from UST,\u201D the trader said in a tweet in mid-February.","People are basically betting that Terra ecosystem becomes big enough to carry UST with it.\n\nBest case is they cap UST so that it\u2019s still manageable. But in theory it\u2019s possible they issue hundreds of billions UST backed by a few billions in real liquidity. pic.twitter.com\/SFZX7UHjNb","Nevertheless, this was not the only bet Do Kown wanted to take. The CEO also invited pseudonymous Twitter user and crypto trader K A L E O to bet on whether LUNA will see the USD 10 mark again in 2022.","I\u2019ll take that bet \u2013 $20mil? Settle eoy 2022","Luckily for Do Kown, K A L E O didn\u2019t take the bet. However, the trader, whose prediction has come true, recently made another forecast that LUNA will bounce back.","\u201CAlso, I\u2019ll be a contrarian once again and say LUNA bounces back some from here,\u201D they said.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 UST and LUNA Keep Collapsing, No Word from Do Kwon on Promised \u2018Recovery Plan\u2019\n\u2013 Conspiracy Theories Abound as Terra Tries to Save UST\n\n\u2013 Luna Foundation Loans Out BTC to Defend Bitcoin Peg, Faces Community Backlash\n\u2013 Bitcoin Extends Sell-Off Despite Luna Buying, Strong On-Chain Data\n\n\u2013 Terra\u2019s USD 10B Bitcoin Bet May be Both a Curse and a Blessing\n\u2013 USDT vs. USDC vs. UST: How Do They Compare?"],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$20mil","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Luna Foundation Loans Out BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"85%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"LUNA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra Tries","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chain Data\n\n\u2013 Terra\u2019s USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Defend Bitcoin Peg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Faces Community Backlash\n\u2013 Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"mid-March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD 80 just days ago","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Terra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sensei Algod","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"mid-February","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Do Kwon","Market","Terra"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
