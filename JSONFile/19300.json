While providing user privacy, the digital currency\u2019s features could potentially make it easier for bad actors to mask illegal transactions.","\u201CAn anonymous wallet allows users to conduct transactions without revealing their identity information, designed to provide a higher degree of privacy protection,\u201D the article reads.","The report also highlighted the speed and cross-border nature of transactions with the digital yuan, which could complicate traditional AML monitoring practices. Transactions with e-CNY are completed almost instantaneously, which reduces the window for regulatory intervention.","In addition, the integration of the digital yuan into the global financial system could raise concerns about its compatibility with international AML standards.","As the currency becomes more widely used internationally, ensuring that transactions comply with a diverse range of regulatory environments becomes increasingly challenging.","The firm suggested integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain to improve real-time monitoring of transactions. This technological upgrade would enhance the ability to promptly identify and address suspicious activities.","Additionally, the report called for refining the identity verification processes, especially concerning anonymous wallets.","By implementing strict transaction limits and ensuring rigorous due diligence, the balance between maintaining user privacy and ensuring transaction transparency can be managed.","On the international front, the report emphasized the importance of aligning e-CNY with global AML standards.","\u201CThere is reason to believe that the implementation and improvement of the digital yuan\u2019s AML guidance policies will provide a healthy, transparent, and secure financial environment for financial institutions, businesses, and the public,\u201D the article reads.","\u201CAs the digital yuan continues to be promoted and used, we look forward to seeing a more efficient, convenient, and secure digital payment future,\u201D the firm concluded."],"entity":[{"type":"Digital Yuan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chen Xin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["anti-money laundering","China","Digital Yuan"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
