South Korean gambling laws are among the tightest in Asia, and the government sees NFT and play-to-earn titles as a form of speculation.","Some developers have attempted to bypass the GRAC\u2019s rulings by releasing their titles directly to the Google Play Store and Apple\u2019s marketplace.","But this week, Hanguk Kyungjae reported, the GRAC has announced that it will move to block this course of action \u2013 and will require firms to apply to it for permission to release titles to the Google and Apple marketplaces.","The app marketplaces will also be told to block games that require in-app purchases prior to playing.","The GRAC set the tone for its crackdown in 2019 when it refused to issue a rating to Infinity Star, a game created by the domestic developer NodeBrick. The body claimed that the use of NFTs in the game was its main reasoning for the ruling, which it has since upheld in legal battles.","Critics in 2019 claimed that the GRAC had \u201Csentenced the domestic blockchain gaming industry to death.\u201D","Developers have responded by launching most of their titles overseas \u2013 but are known to be keen to debut their offerings on the lucrative domestic market.","Major industry players have told Cryptonews.com that a softening of the GRAC\u2019 stance was likely in the future \u2013 but there appears to be scant evidence of this so far. Optimists will hope for a more lenient stance from the next government, with South Korea heading to the polls in a general election next spring.","The GRAC\u2019s stance means that titles such as Axie Infinity (AXS) cannot be downloaded in South Korea, despite their enormous popularity elsewhere in Asia.","____","Learn more:","\u2013 Blockchain Gaming Adoption Jumps, But Regulation & Education Obstacles Are High \u2013 Survey\n\u2013 Crypto-Gaming Is Exploding Into the Playful Future\n\n\u2013 Banking Giant KB Creates Crypto, NFT & CBDC-compatible Wallets\n\u2013 South Korea\u2019s Potential Next President Calls Crypto \u2018A Means of Trading & Investment\u2019\n\n\u2013 Insiders Predict: NFTs the \u2018Gateway Drug to Crypto\u2019, More Countries May Adopt Bitcoin in 2022\n\u2013 Crypto Industry Insiders Share Top Ethereum, DeFi, Gaming, and TradFi Trends for 2022\n "],"entity":[{"type":"Crypto Industry Insiders Share Top Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"GRAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hanguk Kyungjae","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"But Regulation & Education Obstacles","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Apple App Store","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Administration Committee (GRAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google Play Store","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT & CBDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"spring","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Playful Future\n\n\u2013 Banking Giant KB Creates Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Potential Next President Calls Crypto \u2018A Means of Trading & Investment","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Gaming","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Regulation","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
