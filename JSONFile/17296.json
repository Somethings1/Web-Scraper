The company also aims to release an international blockchain version of the game next year.","The game is due to be released on the Klaytn blockchain network, operated by domestic chat app operator Kakao.","However, SkyPeople stated that GRAC has now \u201Cpostponed its deliberation\u201D indefinitely as it conducts an \u201Cin-depth review\u201D into the use of NFTs in game releases.","The same media outlet stated that the commission is wary of rushing into a decision that would likely become a precedent for scores of other domestic blockchain game developers.","A GRAC official was quoted as stating:","\u201CWe have a positive stance on blockchain technology, but we are carefully looking into matters pertaining to the creation of digital assets by encrypting in-game items. We have to be careful here because cryptoassets\u2019 prices vary and are subject to volatility.\u201D","__","Learn more: As DeFi Cools, Altcoin Pump Addicts Smell Fresh Blood in NFTs"],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Administration Committee (GRAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SkyPeople","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GRAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Altcoin Pump Addicts Smell Fresh Blood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kakao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Gaming","Non-fungible tokens","Regulation","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
