And they therefore lacks production treatment and evacuation facilities. At the moment, [Tecpetrol] sells part of the gas it extracts to Chevron. But there is a limit to the amount that it can sell, and that limit has already been reached.\u201D","Markous added that using the gas would also help the firm speed up oil production at the site.","The firm added that it would use three generating facilities at the site, with all three facilities fitted with crypto mining rigs.","The CEO said:","\u201CIn one fell swoop, we will be able to [improve] the environment by not [flaring the] gas, and also mine cryptocurrencies.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"Venezuela","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Peru","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mexico","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Argentina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ecuador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Colombia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Rio Negro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bolivia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Buenos Aires","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ricardo Markous","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tecpetrol","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vaca Muerta","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chevron","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Argentina","Crypto Mining"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
