The project is being carried out in the city of Chengdu, in China\u2019s central Sichuan Province. The bank has teamed up with Chengdu\u2019s education and financial authorities and will let parents pay for their children\u2019s pre- and after-school clubs, sports lessons, and extracurricular lessons using the digital fiat.","Under the program, parents pay a fixed deposit using the digital yuan. These funds are then put into a \u201Csmart contract\u201D with the private contractors who run the clubs or offer the lessons. This contract is only activated when the child attends a club or lesson.","If the child misses a session through illness, for example, the contract is voided, and the deposit is returned to the parents\u2019 e-CNY wallet.","Traditionally, local education and financial authorities have had to act as intermediaries in such situations \u2013 monitoring attendance and taking payments from parents before passing funds on to the private contractors.","But the Bank of China was quoted as stating that using digital yuan smart contracts would allow regulatory authorities to step away from the equation \u2013 and allow parents to make their payments directly to the private contractors. Smart contract technology, the bank suggested, would also promote transparency in payments.","Although smart contracts are traditionally used in the blockchain and crypto space, the central People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) argues that it can make use of smart contract technology in its own e-CNY project. The PBoC has previously applied for at least eight patents that feature \u201Csmart contract\u201D in their titles.","Chinese financial experts have claimed that smart contract technology could be applied to the national payments system once the digital CNY has been rolled out nationwide.","The Bank of China, meanwhile, has also explained that it will give away digital yuan tokens to residents in Chongqing \u2013 provided they only use the coins to pay for low-carbon emission products and services, such as plastic-free food deliveries and public transport.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Chinese Central Bank May Apply Smart Contract Technology to Digital Yuan\n\u2013 Local Tax \u2018First\u2019 for Digital Yuan as Pilot Continues to Broaden Scope\n\n\u2013 Chinese Banks Launch Automatic Digital Yuan-to-Fiat Conversion Tools\n\u2013 Chinese Digital Yuan Spending on the Rise Despite COVID-19-induced Slump\n\n\u2013 Chinese Man Uses Digital Yuan to Pay Court-issued Fine in Legal First\n\u2013 China\u2019s Digital Yuan App Gets Update as Police Deal with First-Ever CBDC \u2018Fraud\u2019 Case"],"entity":[{"type":"Fiat Conversion Tools\n\u2013 Chinese Digital Yuan Spending","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chinese Central Bank May Apply Smart Contract Technology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"PBoC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chongqing","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chinese Banks Launch Automatic Digital Yuan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chinese Man Uses Digital Yuan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank of China","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sichuan Province","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chengdu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Digital Yuan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Central Bank","China","Digital Yuan","Education","Smart Contract"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
