I said it was worthless. I was wrong. Please forgive me, o lord!\u201D","He referred to his 2018 essay titled \u201CEther, A Double Digit Shitcoin\u201D, in which he predicted that the price of ETH would dive below USD 100, saying: \u201CAnd I was right! For a short while\u2026\u201D","In his words, Hayes \u201Cbecame a believer\u201D in 2020, and he went \u201Clong and strong\u201D when he saw a chart depicting how the ETH market capitalization was less than the total market capitalization of all the dapps (decentralized apps) it supported.","\u201CI fervently believe that DeFi offers a credible alternative to the current financial system \u2014 and for now, Ethereum is poised to power the world\u2019s financial computer.\u201D","He argued that the Merge is \u201Cextremely bullish\u201D for the price of ETH \u2013 but also that it has not yet been priced into the market, writing:","\u201CGiven all of the forced selling that occurred during the market drop and the poor financial positions that most crypto investors have been left in, the [M]erge does not appear to be priced in\u2013 and we have an amazing opportunity to increase Ether positions at very attractive levels.\u201D","Hayes went on to say that he is \u201Cmore confident today than ever before that the merge will actually occur,\u201D particularly as the miners are \u201Cbecoming vocal about [its] negative impacts.\u201D","While he said he hasn\u2019t the technical skills to asses whether the Merge will indeed occur in September as estimated, Hayes stressed that \u201Cone group of Ethereum network stakeholders who absolutely can handicap the likelihood of success [is] the current crop of Ethereum miners.\u201D","After the Merge, the Ethereum miners\u2019 machines will become worthless unless they can mine on another valuable chain. As a well-known miner Chandler Guo already talked about an Ethereum hard fork, one that would keep a PoW chain, Hayes claimed to have made contact with other Chinese miners who confirmed that this idea is strong in that particular base.","In April, Hayes hinted he might rebalance his investments away from bitcoin (BTC) and in favor of ETH, arguing \u201Ca massive wall of money\u201D will enter ETH once it is seen as an ESG (environmental, social, and governance)-friendly, yield-bearing asset. \u201CWhen the dust settles at year-end, I believe ETH will be trading north of USD 10,000,\u201D he said. In the latest essay, Hayes reiterated the USD 10,000 prediction but didn\u2019t specify when it might happen.","At 09:16 UTC, ETH trades at USD 1,658 and is up 2% in a day and down 4% in a week. The price jumped 46% in a month, trimming its annual losses to 39%.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 If Ethereum Splits, Leading Exchanges are \u2018Likely\u2019 to List ETHPoW Token \u2013 BitMEX\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin says The Merge is Not \u2018Priced in\u2019 as Investor Promises to Fork Ethereum\n\n\u2013 Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of \u2018Extreme\u2019 Risk in Proof-of-Stake Systems\n\u2013 The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network\n\n\u2013 6 Key Points in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Vision for Ethereum Presented at EthCC\n\u2013 As Bitcoin Keeps Tanking, Arthur Hayes Joins Chorus of USD 1M BTC Predictors and Warns of \u2018The Doom Loop\u2019\n\n\u2013 Next 6-12 Months to be \u2018Brutal\u2019, but Investment \u2018Planting Season\u2019 Starts Now, Arthur Hayes Says\n\u2013 Crypto Selloff Proves Computer Code Leads To \u2018Better Outcome\u2019 Than Human Discretion \u2013 Arthur Hayes"],"entity":[{"type":"Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12 Months","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Chandler Guo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arthur Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Fork Ethereum\n\n\u2013 Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of \u2018Extreme","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ESG","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Vision","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD 1M BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Arthur Hayes","Ethereum","Forecast","Proof-of-stake","Proof-of-work"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
