CEO Xin Wang.","Establishing a board and appointing a chairman are among the first steps Binance has taken to adopt a more conventional corporate structure after years of operating without a headquarters. ","The company agreed to pay $4.3 billion in February as part of a plea deal approved by a US judge. ","Binance\u2019s founder, Changpeng Zhao, also pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering and sanctions violations and is awaiting sentencing in April.","Last month, a group of investors who sought to sue the exchange, its former CEO Changpeng Zhao, and other executives were given a fresh chance to pursue their case. "],"entity":[{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Arnaud Ventura","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chris Holland","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United Arab Emirates","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Richard Teng","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1 billion mark","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Circle Internet Financial","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gojo & Co","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Xin Wang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Barbados","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance Academy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Heina Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lilai Wang","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$4.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bayview Acquisition Corp","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Binance","USDC"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
