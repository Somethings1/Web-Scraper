Salinas, who heads a retail and media empire has announced that his bank, Banco Azteca, will become the first in the nation to accept BTC if he gets his way.","Salinas went public last year with news of his personal bitcoin purchase, going on to advise his Twitter followers (over 900,000 today) to make their own BTC investments. He has since gone on to become one of the nation\u2019s most prominent bitcoin bulls, and has become increasingly vocal with his social media support for the token on Twitter \u2013 possibly sparking a trend amongst young, tech-savvy MPs across the Latin American region.","Salinas is close to the inner machine of the Mexican government, and last year was one of a small clutch of Mexican businesses invited to meet the then-United States President Donald Trump on the latter\u2019s official visit to the nation.","His latest claims, about Banco Azteca, came as part of a flurry of Twitter activity during which he sang BTC\u2019s praises \u2013 and scorned at detractors championing altcoins.","After a portion of a video interview Salinas gave earlier this month was shared by bitcoin bulls such as MicroStrategy\u2019s boss Michael Saylor and prominent BTC investor Anthony Pompliano, the Mexican took to Twitter with zeal, expanding on his BTC plans.","In various tweets and replies, Salinas wrote that \u201Cwe are working to bring [cryptoassets] to our clients at Banco Azteca] and continue promoting freedom.\u201D","He added, in English, \u201Cme and my bank are working to be the first bank in Mexico to accept BTC.\u201D","Saylor pointed out that \u201Cif you are hoping to preserve your wealth for a generation,\u201D Salinas had suggested investing in BTC, as part of a strategy of \u201Cchoosing the highest quality asset you can find and HODL.\u201D","Pompliano, meanwhile, called the video \u201Cincredible\u201D given the Mexican\u2019s \u201Chistoric wealth and success.\u201D","In the video, posted on June 21 by José Rodriguez, an executive at the crypto exchange Bitso, Salinas dismissed claims that BTC is a \u201Ccurrency,\u201D instead claiming that it was clearly an \u201Casset.\u201D","But if it is indeed an \u201Casset,\u201D he added, \u201Cit must have international value, has enormous liquidity, and that\u2019s why it should be anybody\u2019s portfolio.\u201D","During the video, he also added that as an \u201Casset,\u201D it did not matter much if the Bitcoin network was slow, as long as the token continued to perform its function as a store of value.","On Twitter, he said that Saylor\u2019s \u201Cbig all-in bet with MicroStrategy pays off,\u201D adding that Saylor had \u201Cballs of steel.\u201D (Learn more: Bitcoin MicroStrategy: Down by USD 479M in 2021, Up by USD 676M in 10 Months)","But Salinas did not appear afraid of stepping on a few toes \u2013 particularly those of ethereans and altcoiners. He claimed that there was no \u201Cfinite supply\u201D of ETH, and was generally dismissive about its credentials versus those of bitcoin.","On Reddit, one user mused that Salinas \u201Csounds like he definitely doesn\u2019t understand or even know the capabilities of ETH vs BTC.\u201D (Learn more: Why Ethereum is Far From \u2018Ultrasound Money\u2019)","Meanwhile, the billionaire lashed out at \u201Cshitcoins, like dogecoin,\u201D but claimed that the privacy coins monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC) had a distinct advantage over BTC. He explained:","\u201COne of the risks of bitcoin is that governments don\u2019t like it because it lets them get out of the fiat trap, of the fraud of fiat. Because that is what fiat is. Fiat is a fraud. [\u2026] Fiat fraud is inherent to the system, and we are seeing it happen in the United States now. The dollar is a joke.\u201D","The \u201Cadditional discretion\u201D provided by privacy coins, he added, was becoming \u201Cvery important.\u201D","On Twitter, he doubled down on his DOGE disdain. When challenged by a dogecoin enthusiast who stated he would \u201Cstick to DOGE because I\u2019m not a slave,\u201D the Mexican bristled:","\u201CYou\u2019ll stay poor. Good luck.\u201D","_____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 El Salvador Will Be a Serious Test for Bitcoin\u2019s Layer-2 Networks\n\u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum Can Coexist With DeFi Bridging the Two","\u2013 Crypto Elephant Changes The Way The World Works \u2013 Marc Andreessen\n\u2013 Central Banks Step Up Bitcoin, Stablecoin Bashing Efforts Amid CBDC Plans"],"entity":[{"type":"Ricardo Salinas Pliego","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anthony Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Marc Andreessen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Salinas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mexico","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stablecoin Bashing Efforts Amid CBDC Plans","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Banco Azteca","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"José Rodriguez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 21","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ZEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Banco Azteca]","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Anthony Pompliano","Banking","Bitcoin","Dogecoin","Ethereum","Monero","zcash"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
