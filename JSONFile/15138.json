The firm also highlighted its work with authorities, including the freezing of more than $300 million in the last few months.","The UN report does mention that Tether voluntarily froze $225 million in USDT connected to a Southeast Asia-based human trafficking and pig butchering in Nov. 2023, while saying that authorities in the region reported USDT among the most popular cryptocurrencies used by organized crime groups.","Tether\u2019s USDT rose to an all-time high supply of nearly $90 billion in December 2023 but was critiqued by S&P Global Ratings for being worse than rivals at doing its core task: being valued at $1. Tether\u2019s USDT is pegged to the U.S. dollar, but whether it can maintain that status or whether its reserves are safe and actual dollars has been the subject of contention.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra.","\n","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"S&P Global Ratings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Southeast Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nov. 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$90 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"United States Secret Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$225 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"East Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$300 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"UN Office on Drugs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United Nations","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Tether","USDT","United Nations","South East Asia","Asia","Stablecoin","illicit finance","Gambling"],"authors":["Amitoj Singh"]}
