The nuclear power plants have a combined 15 reactors that provide 13.9 GWe of electricity, the seventh-highest nuclear power generation rate in the world.","The ministry stated that \u201Cimplementing cryptocurrency mining projects\u201D could \u201Cprovide additional markets for atomic electricity,\u201D would \u201Cboost the reliability and efficiency of Ukrainian nuclear power plants\u201D and address surplus energy-related matters.","However, in a Facebook post made in the early hours of May 6, the ministry went on to clarify that one nuclear power plant will initiate the \u201Cfirst phase\u201D of the pilot with a \u201Cdata center\u201D near its Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station \u2013 the biggest nuclear plant in Europe.","The ministry says that its pilot, conducted with Energoatom, could eventually \u201Cconnect consumers of [data centers] with a capacity of up to 1000MW,\u201D while the initial Zaporizhia project will see 30MW provided to mining initiatives.","A spokesperson of the ministry told Cryptonews.com that this is only a suggestion. We\u2019ll update the article should the ministry provide more details about the project.","Meanwhile, in the post, the ministry stated that the initiative was part of a move away from \u201CSoviet\u201D economic models, and wrote,","\u201COne modern way to use excess electricity is to direct it into cryptocurrencies. This not only allows you to maintain a guaranteed load for nuclear power plants, but it also gives enterprises the opportunity to raise additional funds.\u201D","The ministry says that the stimulus measures will initially involve government support, but eventually aims to ensure that nuclear power-reliant \u201Cdata centers\u201D become self-sufficient."],"entity":[{"type":"\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Environmental Protection","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Energoatom","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zaporizhia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency","Energy","Mining","Ukraine"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
