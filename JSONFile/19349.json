Pan feels websites and apps that facilitate these practices and\/or help people move money overseas should be sanctioned.","Meanwhile, some major Chinese mining groups are now moving to the U.S., Canada or Iceland. BTC.Top, the third-largest mining pool, is opening a new location in Canada, according to media reports."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Iceland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["China","Regulation"],"authors":["Julia Travers"]}
