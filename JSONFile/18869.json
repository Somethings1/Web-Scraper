Notably, over $40m of the retail loans were refinanced from crypto lender Celsius following its collapse.","Ledn\u2019s Q1 loan volume more than tripled from the previous quarter. In Q4, the company processed just $125.7m in institutional loans and $14.6m in retail loans. Ledn credits this surge to the recent approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, which fueled a rally in Bitcoin\u2019s price.","\u201CThese developments allowed Ledn to process several hundred million in institutional loans to ETF market makers,\u201D the company said.","","Following Celsius\u2019s bankruptcy, Ledn launched a refinancing program and said it garnered confidence from the crypto community. This resulted in Ledn securing $40m in refinanced loans, exceeding half of the total refinanced amount.","\u201CThe first quarter of 2024 has set the tone for a promising year for Ledn, as we\u2019ve not only doubled our loan book since November 2022 but have also solidified our leading position in the market by adapting to the increasing demand for digital asset financial products,\u201D Ledn CEO Adam Reeds said in a statement.","Ledn\u2019s successful Q1 isn\u2019t an isolated case. The broader crypto lending market is experiencing a resurgence. Coinbase\u2019s Q4 2023 shareholder letter revealed a similar trend, with the exchange actively lending $399m to customers during that period.","","Responding to strong client, Ledn rolled out Ethereum-backed loans in February. These ETH loans mirror the lender\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) loans, offering a starting loan-to-value ratio of 50% and an annual interest rate starting at 10.4% (12.4% APR).","Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Ledn\u2019s co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, told Cryptonews that the loan processing experience on the platform is straightforward. \u201CYou do not need to learn how to interact with protocols to access a Ledn ETH-backed loan,\u201D he said.","He also predicted that crypto ETFs will soon encompass a broader array of crypto assets within a single investment vehicle."],"entity":[{"type":"$125.7","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"first quarter of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mauricio Di Bartolomeo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$14.6","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$399m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$106m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"12.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ledn","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"10.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ledn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$690m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$584m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$40m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Adam Reeds","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Lending"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
