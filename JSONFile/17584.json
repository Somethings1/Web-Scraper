These laws also aim to legalize industrial crypto mining and ban most domestic exchanges.","⚡️ Russian Government Crypto Chief: Mining Regulation Is Our Priority","The Russian government\u2019s crypto working group chairman believes Bitcoin (BTC) mining regulation is now a priority for Moscow.#CryptoNews #newshttps:\/\/t.co\/Gqdg4vwnZB","\u2014 Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 9, 2024","","The media outlet noted that the council will send written proposals, which its reporters have already seen, to the Cabinet on May 16.","The documents propose using electricity meter technology to identify suspected miners. Data analysts will \u201Ccompare declared readings with actual electricity usage\u201D using \u201Cremote checking solutions.\u201D","The document also explains how power firms will fine \u201Cillegal\u201D miners. The document proposes allowing power companies to charge home-based offenders at \u201Chigher rates.\u201D","These rates are typically reserved for \u201Cindustrial enterprises.\u201D","US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the developer of a Russian Drone, OKO Design Bureau.

He said:","\u201CAt present, electricity suppliers need to provide proof of crypto mining-related violations in court. That wastes these companies\u2019 time and money. However, if a unified system for fines is developed at the federal level, this will speed up and intensify the fight against [illegal crypto mining].\u201D","Crypto mining remains extremely popular in Russia. But as the activity currently has no legal status, mining coins is currently neither illegal nor legal.","Private mining is not illegal either, and at present, Russian power firms can only step in if they suspect individuals are stealing power from local grids.","The documents reportedly lament that the Russian energy system is \u201Coverloaded\u201D in many areas.","The authors say that this is resulting in \u201Cinterruptions in the supply of electricity to consumers.\u201D The document reportedly claims:","\u201CIn some regions, there has been a significant increase in electrical energy consumption, [often] due to an increase in mining loads. This has led to [\u2026] local deficits in the south-eastern part of [\u2026] Siberia.\u201D","The documents\u2019 authors also said shortages had been reported in \u201Cthe Irkutsk-Cheremkhovo district of the Irkutsk region, the southern part of Buryatia, and certain parts of the Trans-Baikal region.\u201D","These are known crypto mining hotspots, popular for their low power rates and cold winters.","Irkutsk in particular has become a hub for mining, both legal and illegal, in recent years. This has led the region to develop a somewhat complicated relationship with mining.","Izvestia also quoted the Deputy Minister of Energy Pavel Snikkars as saying energy tariffs for miners should \u201Cincrease in such a way as to encourage them to move away from energy-deficient areas.\u201D","The same ministry has previously floated proposals aimed at reducing the strain on overloaded networks.","One included forcing industrial miners to shut off their rigs for certain fixed portions of the year.","While these have been met with dismay by most miners, most industrial miners want Moscow to \u201Churry up\u201D and legalize their sector.","Bitcoin mining has been going on for a long time, but is becoming less profitable due to the design.

We would be happy to invite inspections by power providers if that would be desirable.
