And the platforms, the intermediaries are doing things that we would never allow or think the New York Stock or Nasdaq would do.\u201D","More recently, after a 3-2 vote by SEC commissioners, including Gensler, in favor of allowing spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC Chair once again hit back against cryptocurrencies.","\u201CWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot Bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin,\u201D Gensler said in his statement.","He also advised investors to remain cautious about the risks associated with Bitcoin and crypto-related products."],"entity":[{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin ETP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York Stock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["GameStop","NFT"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
