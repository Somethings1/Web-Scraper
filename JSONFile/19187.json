How well this new system would work depends on \u201Cexactly how much due diligence is done\u201D to ensure that those behind the blue checkmarks are indeed who they claim to be, he said in a tweet. ","That said, there is a \u2018but\u2019. Buterin followed his statement up with:","\u201C\u201DPay $8\/month and call yourself whatever\u201D would damage the blue check\u2019s anti-scam role. But if there\u2019s more actual verification, the result is very different.\u201D","And while quite a few people suggested in the comments that paying $8 for the famed verified badge would be worth it for any scammer if that means gaining people\u2019s trust and being able to earn a lot more than the \u2018invested\u2019 $8 \u2013 others, similarly to Buterin, argued that this could be avoided with more verification.","This is a great point. If there is more actual verification done to make sure blue checks are who they say they are, then the result will be very different.","Yet, it is somewhat ironic that crypto supporters and possibly decentralization advocates would argue for more know-your-customer (KYC)-type measures. ","\u201CPower to the people\u201D Blue for $8\/month,\u201D said the new Twitter chief yesterday upon announcing the news. ","You will also get:\n\u2013 Priority in replies, mentions & search, which is essential to defeat spam\/scam\n\u2013 Ability to post long video & audio\n\u2013 Half as many ads","But many people argued that it is not entirely clear how power will be given to those who cannot afford the monthly fee. ","I got my blue checkmark to stop clone accounts from scamming children, so now I\u2019d have to pay to protect my followers myself? I feel liberated already","Buterin, however, disagreed, saying that the current system is \u201C*far* more exclusive than even the $20\/month level from yesterday.\u201D ","He does not see it as creating any sort of an \u201Ceconomic hierarchy.\u201D Buterin added, however, that,","\u201CIdeally, though, verification would be charged at-cost and separate from other premium services.\u201D","Yes, this will destroy the bots. If a paid Blue account engages in spam\/scam, that account will be suspended.\n\nEssentially, this raises the cost of crime on Twitter by several orders of magnitude."," "," "],"entity":[{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$20","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$8","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Community","Elon Musk","Fraud","Scam","Twitter","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
