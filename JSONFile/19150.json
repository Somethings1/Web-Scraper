This follows Circle submitting plans for an initial public offering to the US securities regulator in January.","\u201CThe initial public offering is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,\u201D Circle said at the time.","Choosing the US as its new home could mean Circle faces a higher tax burden, according to Bloomberg. Companies would generally do the opposite, flocking to Ireland for its business-friendly environment and low tax rate.","The country\u2019s 12.5% rate pales in comparison to many other European nations. This makes Ireland a magnet for international firms looking to keep taxes down.","Launched in 2013, Circle has carved a niche in the crypto industry. It is best known for issuing USDC, a stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. As of May 2024, USDC boasts a market cap exceeding $32b, solidifying its place as a major player.","Circle\u2019s core business focuses on issuing and managing USDC. Stablecoins are generally said to provide stability for transactions in the often-turbulent cryptocurrency market.","Further, Circle\u2019s plan to go public through a traditional IPO follows a failed 2021 attemptÂ via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger. The IPO will proceed after SEC approval, but remains subject to market conditions and other factors.","In January, Circle revealed plans to introduce USDC on the Celo network. Celo is a Layer-1 blockchain evolving into an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling network. This collaboration seeks to capitalize on Celo\u2019s mobile-centric user community in areas with the highest blockchain adoption rates."],"entity":[{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Republic of Ireland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"12.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SPAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$32b","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Circle","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ireland","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Circle","IPO"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
