This week, the foremost digital currency has shown resilience, registering a modest 0.22% rise. Currently positioned above a critical pivot point of $61,650, Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory seems poised for further exploration towards $70,000.","With a trading volume of around $32.77 billion in 24 hours and a market cap of almost $1.25 trillion, ongoing developments influence Bitcoin price predictions.","","On the technical front, the key price levels to watch for Bitcoin include the pivot point, which stands at $61,651. Above this level, the immediate resistance is found at $64,564, followed by further resistance levels at $67,084 and $69,356.","On the downside, the immediate support level is at $59,164. Should Bitcoin move lower, the next support levels to watch are $56,677 and $54,336.","Bitcoin\u2019s recent activity on the 4-hour timeframe illustrates a bullish trend, marked by a crossing above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,574, which previously acted as resistance.","ðŸ“ˆ #Bitcoin continues its bullish trend, staying above pivotal $61,651. Watch for resistance levels at $64,564, $67,084, & $69,356. Support begins at $59,164 with further levels at $56,677 & $54,336.

However, there is a noted resistance at approximately $63,200, where a downward channel may temporarily restrict upward movement.","Should Bitcoin break above this threshold, it may swiftly approach the next resistance level at $64,564.","A further bullish breakout could potentially propel Bitcoin towards higher resistance levels of $67,084 and even $70,000, following a clear breach of a double-top pattern near $67,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 63, supports this optimistic outlook, indicating a dominant bullish sentiment in the market.","Technical Indicators:","Given these factors, the market condition for Bitcoin remains favorable above the $61,651 pivot point. This level is crucial; maintaining above it suggests potential for higher climbs towards the outlined resistance markers. Conversely, a dip below this pivot could trigger a significant sell-off, targeting initial support at $59,164 and potentially lower levels if bearish pressure intensifies.","Conclusion: Bitcoin is poised for potential further gains if it remains above the pivotal $61,651 mark. Traders should monitor this level closely as staying above it could lead to testing higher resistances at $64,564 and beyond.","However, falling below $61,651 could see Bitcoin retreat towards lower support levels, with the market reassessing its bullish stance. The current technical setup underscores the critical juncture for Bitcoin\u2019s short-term price trajectory.","","","","99Bitcoins, a leader in digital education, is transforming the way users learn about cryptocurrency through its \u2018learn-to-earn\u2019 platform.
