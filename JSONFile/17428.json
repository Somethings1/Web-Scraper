I\u2019m not na√Øve enough to believe that it\u2019s absolute. I\u2019m not na√Øve enough to believe I\u2019m always going to be on the right side. But the problem is that you live or die by whether he gets up on the left or right side of the bed.\u201D","Cardano\u2019s ADA is one of the industry\u2019s safest altcoins. It\u2019s not an opaque blockchain like Solana, so it doesn\u2019t suffer frequent outages. It\u2019s not in the middle of a legal quagmire with regulators like Binance or Ripple.","That means it\u2019s not frittering away resources defending itself and having its image scrutinized. Finally, it doesn\u2019t face the same accusations as Ava Labs. The AVAX progenitors allegedly use corrupt lawyers and vast troll bot armies to weaken competitors.","But one thing ADA can\u2019t do as well as other tokens is Bitcoin mining. Enter Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), a promising project that has raised over $11.3 million in an ongoing presale from excitement over its utility alone.","Wanna mine Bitcoin but don\u2019t want to buy the energy-intensive hardware for it?","Bitcoin Minetrix has got you.","The protocol uses Ethereum smart contracts to turn investors\u2019 BTCMTX tokens into cloud mining machinery. There is no need to purchase specialist mining rigs. Simply buy and stake BTCMTX via the website.","The more BTCMTX tokens an investor stakes, the more cloud mining credits they\u2019ll receive.","Mining credits represent hash power.","The greater the hash power, the more attempts the cloud Bitcoin mining software can make to break cryptographic puzzles and validate blocks of transactions.","This is the process of mining, and it is rewarded in Bitcoin.","The staked BTCMTX also generates yields in BTCMTX, further fuelling the staking\/mining cycle.","Only 2 days remaining until the conclusion of Stage 27 for #BitcoinMinetrix!","How do mining hardware advancements impact the landscape of #Bitcoin mining? üíª‚õèÔ∏è pic.twitter.com\/sfM36jAx9K","\u2014 Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) February 23, 2024","","With miners\u2019 rewards set to halve on April 19, investors may want to get in early.
