The move left 1.7 million users unable to redeem their assets, and sparked fears that funds would be locked indefinitely.","The firm has hired restructuring consultants from Alvarez & Marsal, an advisory firm, to explore the possibility of bankruptcy filings, according to people with knowledge of the matter who spoke to the Wall Street Journal last week.","The lender\u2019s financial issues come amid a wider crypto market crash. In May, algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and its sister coin LUNA imploded spectacularly in a $40 billion collapse, destabilizing the cryptocurrency market and spurring $300 billion in losses across the cryptocurrency economy.","The crash has been driven, in part, by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to fight sky-high inflation through a series of aggressive interest rate hikes, which has fueled a bout of risk-off selling of digital assets.","Prior to the crash, Celsius experienced massive success in its fundraising, accruing $750 million in its latest funding round in November 2021 at a valuation just north of $3.25 billion. As of May 2022, the firm had lent out more than $8 billion to clients and had $12 billion in assets under management.","Read More: How Crypto Lender Celsius Overheated"],"entity":[{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$40 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"How Crypto Lender Celsius Overheated","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alvarez & Marsal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.25 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$300 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$750 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S. Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$12 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June 12","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Celsius","Crypto Winter"],"authors":["Elizabeth Napolitano"]}
