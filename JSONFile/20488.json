Aave and Twitter\u2019s Bluesky Move Towards New Social Media Standard","category":["Altcoin News "],"content":["Â ","Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave (AAVE) has launched an open-source, decentralized social media ecosystem dubbed Lens Protocol. Concurrently, the Twitter-backed Bluesky project has formed an independent organization to implement its vision of creating \u201Can open and decentralized standard for social media.\u201D","Aave announced its Lens project on Monday, describing it as \u201Ca permissionless, composable, and decentralized social graph that makes building a Web3 social platform easy.\u201DÂ ","The protocol\u2019s name comes from Lens Culinaris, a \u201Ctall, branched plant\u201D that has \u201Ca symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria. If the roots are left in the ground, they will provide a source of nitrogen for its neighbor,\u201D according to the Lens website.","This possibly reflects the project\u2019s open-source nature, which would allow the community to build on it.","Detailing about the social platform, the project said that it would be equipped with \u201Cfamiliar social media functions like having a profile, commenting, resharing a post, and more.\u201D However, Lens Protocol is powered by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with users owning all their content.","5\/ðŸ‘¤Profile NFTs are the main primitive of the Lens Protocol. These dynamic NFTs are composable, non-custodial & permissionless. Individual addresses can own profile NFTs, an address can have multiple profile NFTs & a profile NFT can be owned & run by a DAO via a multisig wallet!","Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of Aave, first revealed the project in mid-July. The move came after Twitter\u2019s founder Jack Dorsey unveiled their Bitcoin (BTC) decentralized exchange (DEX) project TBD.","\u201CSince jack is going to build Aave on Bitcoin, Aave should build Twitter on Ethereum,\u201D Kulechov tweeted at the time.","Meanwhile, speaking of Twitter, Bluesky has announced the formation of the Bluesky PBLLC, a Public Benefit LLC that seeks to create a framework for what an open protocol for social media should include.","\u201COur mission is to develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation,\u201D the project said.Â ","The team added that Jack Dorsey will be a board member, alongside Bluesky CEO Jay Graber and Jabber\/XMPP (messaging service and open communication protocol) inventor Jeremie Miller.","The moves highlight a new trend towards the decentralization of social media. On October 4, Facebook and its family of apps went down for several hours.
