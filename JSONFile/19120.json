Wright has argued that the real BTC is his Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). ","Additionally, Wright has sued 15 developers to obtain 111,000 BTC worth $2.5 billion. Judge Colin Birss in London\u2019s Court of Appeals has allowed this case to be trialed.","This week, the news broke that the Bitcoin white paper has been stored within every modern version of the operating system for Apple\u2019s Mac computers.","According to an April 5 blog post from technologist Andy Baio, a PDF of the Bitcoin white paper has \u201Capparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.\u201D","Anyone can find a copy of Bitcoin\u2019s foundational text on MacOS operating systems using a simple command in the Terminal. ","Notably, Apple has a history of hiding files on its products for users to uncover. ","For instance, the game \u201CMonty Python\u2019s Complete Waste of Time\u201D was once hidden on Apple\u2019s first CD-ROM, and the tech giant remained secretive about the fact even after it was discovered.","The Bitcoin white paper was published in 2008 by a person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. ","While the identity of the author(s) remains a mystery, the document has been republished numerous times and is widely considered a seminal piece of work in the history of cryptocurrencies. "],"entity":[{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monty Python\u2019s Complete Waste of Time\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Craig Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2019s Court of Appeals","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Andy Baio","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2008","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Colin Birss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Satoshi Vision","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Apple\u2019s Mac","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Craig Wright","Satoshi Nakamoto"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
