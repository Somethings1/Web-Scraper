Powell has a reputation that he wants to keep, Novogratz said.","\u201COnce the Fed pauses, I think bitcoin is going to the moon,\u201D the investor added.","Further, Novogratz also said about bitcoin that \u201Cit is far more important outside of the US than it is inside the US.\u201D He argued that while the US dollar has remained \u201Cfairly stable\u201D for a long time, the same cannot be said about the local currencies in Russia, Turkey, and other places.","However, he also noted that the goal from his perspective is not to replace the dollar with bitcoin. Instead, for investors, the focus should be to keep some of their wealth stored in BTC, he said.","Asked how high bitcoin will ever go, Novogratz replied \u201Ca million dollars.\u201D","\u201CI pray that the dollar stays strong and bitcoin doesn\u2019t go to infinity. If bitcoin goes to infinity, it would mean all stability is gone in the West,\u201D Novogratz told the audience.","At 15:59 UTC, BTC trades at USD 44,138 and is down almost 4% in a day. It jumped almost 15% in a month, trimming its annual losses to less than 25%.","____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Game Theory of Bitcoin Adoption by Nation-States\n\u2013 \u2018New Inflationary Era\u2019 Upon Us, Central Bank Action Will be Unpopular \u2013 BIS\u2019 Carstens Warns\n\n\u2013 War in Ukraine to Make Countries Rethink Currency Dependencies \u2013 BlackRock CEO\n\u2013 The Ukraine War: How Russia\u2019s Aggression Affected Bitcoin & Crypto and What Might Happen Next\n\n\u2013 Fed Can\u2019t Stop Prices From Going Up Anytime Soon, But There\u2019s Good News, Too\n\u2013 Freezing Russian Reserve Assets Marks End of Monetary Regime; Gold, Bitcoin to Rise \u2013 Arthur Hayes\n\n\u2013 Crypto Bottom is In and \u2018Massive Rally\u2019 Awaits, Pantera Capital Predicts\n\u2013 Hayes Says He Aims to Rebalance Portfolio in Favor of Ethereum, Sets New Price Target for ETH"],"entity":[{"type":"How Russia\u2019s Aggression Affected Bitcoin & Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Turkey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Miami","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"million dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank Action Will be Unpopular \u2013 BIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Bottom","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Pantera Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Carstens","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Anthony \u201CPomp\u201D Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"West","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"What Might Happen Next\n\n\u2013 Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u2018Massive Rally\u2019","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Too\n\u2013 Freezing Russian Reserve Assets Marks End of Monetary Regime","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arthur Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jerome Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Federal Reserve (Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201D Galaxy Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Federal Reserve","Forecast","Mike Novogratz"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
