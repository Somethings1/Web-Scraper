Additionally, the regulation mandates that issuers of stablecoins maintain appropriate reserves to ensure their stability and security."],"entity":[{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"EBA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eighth Directive on Administrative Cooperation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"European Union","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Banking Authority (EBA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MiCA","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"December 30, 2024","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulation","Europe"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
