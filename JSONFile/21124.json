So what we are saying is that a similar pattern on this unbundling and re-intermediation that happened with the internet, a similar pattern will happen with value exchange, which is at the end further and unbundling reintermediation,\u201D the analyst said.","Meanwhile, in their latest report on blockchains, Gartner claims that we\u2019ll have to wait another five years to a decade to see a transformational impact that will have been made by these technologies.","The possible timeline goes like this:","However, for blockchain to become mainstream, Gartner says they can\u2019t rely on users having enough technical knowledge to choose the best aspects of a blockchain for themselves, and they must have the issue of interoperability between different blockchain platforms resolved. In September, Gartner already warned that interoperability issues and other factors may hinder financial companies hoping to deploy blockchain solutions over the next three to five years.","Adding to this, Chesini discussed the four key interconnected impediments for financial service industries, as presented in the report \u2013 the first two concerning governance, and the latter two interoperability and integration:",""],"entity":[{"type":"Fabio Chesini","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"TechRepublic","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Chesini","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gartner","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Blockchain","Research"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
