He underscored the significant role of central banking decisions in shaping market trends across various asset classes. Besides, Novogratz expressed confidence in the SEC\u2019s imminent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.","\u201CWe\u2019re gonna get this ETF before Jan. 10. That\u2019s kind of the drop-dead date that Gensler has before he gets in trouble with Grayscale and the lawsuit,\u201D said Novogratz.","It is unclear if Novogratz was specifically referring to Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF or any other Bitcoin ETF applications filed by other financial institutions. Meanwhile, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the SEC needs to approve Bitcoin ETF filings simultaneously to avoid giving any issuer an early advantage.","\u201CWe\u2019ve publicly been advocates of the fact that when the commission is ready to give the requisite approvals for spot products to come to market, that it should be done all at once,\u201D said Sonnenshein in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201CThe issuers who are operationally ready to launch their products should come out the gate all at once.\u201D","\"The Fed's pivot is really important. That press conference was as dovish as anybody expected and the markets are behaving that way,\" says @Novogratz. \"#Crypto likes it. We are going to get this ETF before January 10.\" pic.twitter.com\/Tu7uSHiPcV","\u2014 Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) December 19, 2023","","Novogratz also addressed to the crypto and Bitcoin market performances. \u201CFor all the Bitcoin skeptics out there,\u201D said Novogratz, \u201CThe Fed\u2019s pivot is really important. That press conference was as dovish as anybody expected. And the markets are behaving that way.\u201D","\u201CI think crypto likes it,\u201D concluded Novogratz.","BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF has been officially assigned the ticker IBIT, as revealed in an amended S-1 filing with the SEC. The filing also marks a shift to a cash redemption model, aligning with SEC preferences. This model requires transactions in cash for Bitcoin holdings, contrasting with the previously considered \u201Cin-kind\u201D model.","Similarly, ARK Invest and 21Shares have amended their filings to adopt this model. The SEC\u2019s decisions on various Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF applications, including those from ARK Invest and 21Shares, remain pending into 2024."],"entity":[{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan. 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sonnenshein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Sonnenshein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"The Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 19, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["ARK Invest","Bitcoin","Bitcoin ETF","Blackrock","Galaxy Digital","Grayscale","SEC"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
