The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content,\u201D they added.","According to them, the information contained in this framework may apply to entities conducting the following activities related to digital assets:","The framework focuses on the Howey test that helps to determine whether an asset, including digital assets, is an \u201Cinvestment contract.\u201D","\u201CUsually, the main issue in analyzing a digital asset under the Howey test is whether a purchaser has a reasonable expectation of profits (or other financial returns) derived from the efforts of others,\u201D according to the framework.","It goes further to explain:","","\u201CA purchaser may expect to realize a return through participating in distributions or through other methods of realizing appreciation on the asset, such as selling at a gain in a secondary market.\nWhen a promoter, sponsor, or other third party (or affiliated group of third parties) (each, an \u201CActive Participant\u201D or \u201CAP\u201D) provides essential managerial efforts that affect the success of the enterprise, and investors reasonably expect to derive profit from those efforts, then this prong of the test is met.\nRelevant to this inquiry is the \u201Ceconomic reality\u201D of the transaction and \u201Cwhat character the instrument is given in commerce by the terms of the offer, the plan of distribution, and the economic inducements held out to the prospect.\u201D The inquiry, therefore, is an objective one, focused on the transaction itself and the manner in which the digital asset is offered and sold.\u201D","The framework also listed the following characteristics that are important in evaluating a digital asset \u2013 \u201Cthe stronger their presence, the less likely the Howey test is met\u201D:","However, the document added that even in cases where a digital asset can be used to purchase goods or services on a network, where that network\u2019s or digital asset\u2019s functionality is being developed or improved, there may be securities transactions.","According to the framework, in this case, among other factors, the following is present:\n\u2013 the digital asset is offered or sold to purchasers at a discount to the value of the goods or services;\n\u2013 the digital asset is offered or sold to purchasers in quantities that exceed reasonable use;\n\u2013 and\/or there are limited or no restrictions on reselling those digital assets, particularly where an AP is continuing in its efforts to increase the value of the digital assets or has facilitated a secondary market.\n____","\u201CThis guidance not only confirms that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities, it also goes a long way in helping entrepreneurs and technologists who have done the right thing know that they have done the right thing, and it should help those who want to build new networks know how the securities laws will be applied,\u201D Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at the Coin Center, a Washington based crypto-focused research and advocacy center, wrote in commentary on the framework.","According to him, the bottom line is that it is possible to fundraise by selling tokens in compliance with the securities laws and then have those tokens be clearly not securities when the promoter is no longer essential to the continued viability of the project.","Meanwhile, lawyer, blockchain enthusiast Preston Byrne tweeted that \u201Cthere\u2019s really nothing new here.\u201D","\u201CAny lawyer looking realistically at token sales will have given advice along these lines for years,\u201D he said.","According to Philip Liu, co-founder and chief legal officer of Arca, a Los Angeles-based crypto investment management firm, \u201Cthe SEC just says if you issue tokens based on blockchain for use as a mere exchange mechanism for existing goods and services, the tokens are not a security.\u201D","Andrew \u201CDrew\u201D Hinkes, co-founder and the General Counsel of investment firm Athena Blockchain, concluded that \u201Cit\u2019ll be another way for lawyers to analyze offerings and make arguments, but this doesn\u2019t create the checklist that so many have begged for- which makes sense.\u201D","\u201CThe SEC wants you to talk to get lawyers and to communicate with the SEC on Finhub,\u201D he said in a tweet.","In March, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton also clarified his position on crypto, however, not everyone was convinced back then.\n____","Stephen Palley, a partner at U.S.-based corporate law firm Anderson Kill, discusses what the framework means for ICOs","____","Also, the Division of Corporation Finance issued a no-action request regarding TurnKey Jet (TKJ), a private aviation firm, concluding that tokens issued by the company are not securities.","According to the Division, these are the reasons why it will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission:","Blockchain and
