Meanwhile, NFTs still held by 3AC itself look to be worth $2.4 million.","Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the two founders of now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, have launched a new platform for trading crypto-related bankruptcy claims.","However, the venture, called Open Exchange, has failed to gather momentum despite the thriving market for bankruptcy claims.","In a now-deleted tweet, Open Exchange admitted that its total volume in the first 24 hours was a measly $13.64. ","The firm\u2019s CEO, Leslie Lamb, explained that the numbers are the result of the fact that it will strive to build liquidity over time without relying on internal market makers. According to Lamb, the decision was reached as a direct consequence of the collapse of FTX.","Furthermore, before the end of its first trading day, Open Exchange suffered another setback as its Twitter account was suspended for unknown reasons. ","In July last year, 3AC filed for bankruptcy, declaring its business had \u201Ccollapsed in the wake of extreme fluctuations in cryptocurrency markets.\u201D ","Among others, 3AC reported major losses as a result of the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in May 2022. ","In August 2022, the fund\u2019s liquidators obtained the permission of a Singaporean court to gain access to key records, obtaining more information about the assets of the collapsed firm. "],"entity":[{"type":"Sotheby\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"August 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sotheby\u2019s Head of Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dmitri Cherniak","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Autoglyphs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Larva Labs\u2019 Zombie CryptoPunk #6649","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Bouhanna","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$13.64","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Chromie Squiggle #","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lamb","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Snowfro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kyle Davies","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$21 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"July last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Leslie Lamb","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Open Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tyler Hobbs","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Starry Night Capital NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Teneo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dune Analytics","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["NFTs","Three Arrows Capital"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
