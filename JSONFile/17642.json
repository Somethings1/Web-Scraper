So far they have collectively netted $12 billion, helping Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $73,737.94 yesterday.","On Tuesday, the ETFs took in $1 billion in inflows, with BlackRock\u2019s accounting for the $848 million bulk of it.","However the release that day of last month\u2019s hot US inflation readings appear to have dampened enthusiasm for riskier assets this weekend.","Over on WIF\u2019s trading chart we can see a gradual rally from the end of February that starts to get volatile around a week into March.","The sudden upward momentum on Tuesday March 12 was very bullish but it fizzled out by Thursday.","Given WIF\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) of about 50, it\u2019s not likely to decline unless Bitcoin does. In any case, WIF will find strong support at $2.","WIF is pure meme stock, which makes it a volatile allocation for any portfolio. Meme coins are highly whimsical in nature and their pricing often exaggerates market trends.","For instance, when Bitcoin was rallying last week, meme coins were rallying even harder. Today, when Bitcoin and Ethereum are posting losses, leading meme coins are posting heavier ones.","Investors who want to support the altcoin sector should really limit their exposure to altcoins. Since their value is dictated by their viral appeal and trendiness rather than their underlying protocol, a sudden loss of interest could be disastrous for holders.","Blockchain proponents believe that the future of gaming will incorporate blockchain tech to handle and record payments. Not only will blockchain be more integrated in gaming, it will also be more present in the wider web. Advocates of the idea refer to this iteration of the internet as Web 3.","Another technology that will drive future innovations in gaming and the web is virtual reality (VR). With that in mind, it would seem that the crypto projects that are most ahead of the curve are VR gaming projects like 5th Scape ($5SCAPE).","BTS of Cage Conquest Trailer Making ðŸ¥Š\n.#5thscape #5scape #vrgaming #vrgame #gaming pic.twitter.com\/MEZ4bZ261R","\u2014 5th Scape (@5th_scape) February 8, 2024","","5th Scape is the world\u2019s first virtual and augmented reality cryptocurrency gaming ecosystem.
