SK Shieldus, formerly ADT Caps, is one of the nation\u2019s biggest physical and internet security brands.","Per News1, the company stated that as of January this year, the company had seen evidence of SIM swap attacks taking place \u2013 with criminals specifically targeting mobile phone users who have crypto holdings.","The firm added that this trend would likely continue upward in the months ahead, and added that a recent attack on a domestic decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol had seen criminals make off with some USD 1.7 million.","Furthermore, the company added that notorious ransomware groups were carrying out \u201Cre-branding\u201D efforts in an attempt to avoid the attention of investigative authorities. SK Shieldus claimed that these \u201Cre-branding\u201D drives were a sign that such groups would \u201Cbecome more active.\u201D Some groups, the firm said, were now preparing the \u201Claunch\u201D of \u201Ca variety of attacks.\u201D\n\nSK Shieldus added that \u201Chacking\u201D attacks on a number of crypto targets would expand in H2, with more DeFi targets already in criminals\u2019 crosshairs.","\u201CWe expect more attacks targeting virtual assets [in general],\u201D the firm stated.","It added that lone-wolf hackers were now a dying breed \u2013 and that bigger groups were now looking to wove into the space. An executive was quoted as explaining:","\u201CIn the past, hackers developed ransomware alone. But now they are systematically hiring malicious code developers. They are prepared to share their income with these developers.\u201D","The firm concluded that companies should keep an eye on the LockBit ransomware gang, which began to step up its activity in September 2019 \u2013 when it launched so-called ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations.","The SK subsidiary stated that its data showed that LockBit is currently up to three times more active than other RaaS groups, including Conti and BlackCat.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Hacker Used \u2018Social Media Data Leak\u2019 to Steal USD 660K in Crypto from 90 Victims \u2013 Police\n\u2013 Woman Gets 5-year Jail Term After Stealing USD 87K Worth of Crypto in Dating App Scam\n\n\u2013 MetaMask Aims to Help Crypto Scam & Phishing Victims Take Legal Action Against Fraudsters\n\u2013 Personal Data Leaks In Crypto Are Inevitable, Here\u2019s What Can Be Done\n\n\u2013 Terraform Officials Banned from Leaving South Korea as Do Kwon \u2018May Apply for Singaporean Citizenship\u2019\n\u2013 South Korea to Launch a Crypto Regulatory Agency in Wake of LUNA Crash"],"entity":[{"type":"SK Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Leaving South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SK Telecom","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ADT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MetaMask Aims to Help Crypto Scam & Phishing Victims Take Legal Action Against Fraudsters\n\u2013 Personal Data","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the second half of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD 87K Worth of Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SK Shieldus","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Regulatory Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Conti","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Crime","Forecast","Scam","Security","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
