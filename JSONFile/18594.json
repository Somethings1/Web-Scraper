No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant.\u201D","In recent years, the SEC has made progress in approving crypto-related exchange-traded products for U.S. exchanges, including investment vehicles tied to ETH and Bitcoin futures, along with the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January.","In a separate development, the SEC has once again extended the deadline to decide on the approval of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). ","The SEC announced that the previous deadline of March 31 will be postponed to May 30. ","The ETF proposed by digital asset management firm Grayscale aims to invest in Ethereum futures contracts.","The SEC\u2019s decision to extend the deadline follows its earlier postponement in December 2023, during which it sought additional public input on whether the ETF should be listed. ","Grayscale had proposed listing and trading shares of its Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E in September 2023. ","Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that Grayscale might be using its futures ETF application as a strategic move to influence the SEC\u2019s decision on approving its spot Ether ETF. ","If the SEC were to approve Grayscale\u2019s futures ETF, it could strengthen Grayscale\u2019s argument for the approval of its spot Ether ETF application.","Furthermore, the SEC has also delayed its decision on whether to approve Grayscale\u2019s spot Ether ETF, opening the application to public comments on January 25. "],"entity":[{"type":"Bloomberg ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 25","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York Stock Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Columbia Law School","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulation","Securities and Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
