The lawsuit concerns his promotion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Binance.","According to Newsweek, Judge Roy Altman issued the ruling, stating, \u201CWe deny without prejudice the Defendant\u2019s 29 motion to dismiss.\u201D","","\u201CAccordingly, we direct the Clerk of Court to close and stay this case until we have adjudicated the pending motions to compel arbitration in the related action,\u201D the judge added.","Arbitration is a private form of dispute resolution in which a final decision on the case is left to a neutral, mutually accepted third party rather than going to court.","Investors sued Ronaldo in November 2023, one year after the athlete launched an NFT collection called \u201CCR7\u201D in collaboration with Binance.","The collection\u2019s name represents Ronaldo\u2019s Initials and shirt number, which he often uses to brand his products. It features digital collectibles of himself and moments from his sports career and purports to stand for \u201Cinnovation, artistry, and the unparalleled thrill of fan engagement,\u201D according to Binance\u2019s website.","Prosecutors alleged last year that his promotion of those NFTs was \u201Cdeceptive and unlawful,\u201D however, leading them to costly and unsafe investment decisions.

Binance is currently fighting U.S. regulators in court as to whether the NFTs and tokens on its platform constitute investment contracts under U.S. securities law.","Plaintiffs argued that Ronaldo\u2019s promotional efforts sent Google searches for the keyword \u201CBinance\u201D up 500% upon his announcement of his partnership with the exchange.
