Now, he\u2019s using those millions to wage a longshot Senate campaign in the state where \u201CLive Free or Die\u201D is more than just a motto.\u202F<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI didn't intend to run for office. I just want to be left alone. I wanted my own business and to have the government mind their own business,\u201D Fenton said. \u201CThat's why I came to New Hampshire along with thousands and thousands of other people.\u201D<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fenton is running an untraditional campaign. He\u2019s self-funding his bid with his bitcoin fortune \u2013 he reported pouring 85 bitcoin, worth nearly $1.6 million, into his campaign \u2013 rather than soliciting cash from Republican donors. He spends hours in audio chatrooms on Twitter talking about his political philosophy and educating listeners about digital assets. He hasn\u2019t spoken with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party\u2019s major campaign organizing force, even though it\u2019s traditionally a major source of funding for candidates.\u202F<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently running a distant third in a five-person race, Fenton likely won\u2019t get the chance to vie for a Senate seat. But his campaign has managed to give crypto airtime during the run-up to tomorrow\u2019s primary. And at a time when many financial privacy advocates are on edge over what they see as government overreach, Fenton\u2019s campaign, like bitcoin itself, is in many ways a protest against the power of the state. <\/span>&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fenton\u2019s bitcoin background has drawn attention. At a recent candidate forum in Salem, a town of 30,000 on the border of Massachusetts, <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the first moderator question<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">was about Fenton\u2019s claim that US currency is just \u201Cpictures of presidents.\u201D\u202F<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe have a very deeply broken fiat money system,\u201D Fenton said. \u201CBitcoin is sound and limited in supply.

Three of the four candidates on stage agreed with Fenton, acknowledging crypto\u2019s move into the mainstream. Former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith even mentioned that he owns digital assets.

He became so passionate about the original cryptocurrency that he later\u202Fvolunteered as executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation. He then founded the Satoshi Roundtable, an invitation-only blockchain industry retreat. Fenton has served as managing director of the New Hampshire-based Chainstone Labs, a digital assets advisory and portfolio management firm, for four years.\u202F\u202F<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The married father of four moved to New Hampshire in 2017 as part of the Free State Project.
