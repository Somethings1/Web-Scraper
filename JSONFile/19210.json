According to the release, this would enable faster transaction processing and onboarding of users.","While the current speed is pegged at 2mb\/s for uploads and a download speed of 20mb\/s, the BNB protocol sets for five times better performance by tackling the blockchain scaling problem in several ways. ","Aside from the base speeds, it integrates a bundle service that allows users to group several files into a single storage order making it faster to send more items. It can be similar to the model of lumping on-chain transactions together to drive scalability as used across multiple chains. ","A major update hailed by several analysts is the interoperability of the features being described as a multi-chain ecosystem giving users access to diverse platforms. Its cross-chain programmability makes it possible for smart contracts to become resource owners for them to give permissions as they own and control resources in future operations. ","The project promises a design to perfectly integrate AI to web3 for several benefits like creating a specialized storage model for huge files and off-chain generic computing to process large data off-chain in a bid to save time and cost. ","\u201CThe current AI landscape faces a unique set of challenges that Web3 has the unique ability to address as well. Some examples include blockchain facilitating ownership, decentralization, transparency, and innovation for builders. ","On network governance, the release states that Greenfield makes it easier and cheaper to participate in the network either as a storage provider or user by reducing computational demands, simplifying exit processes, and decreasing energy usage on devices."],"entity":[{"type":"the first quarter of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"fourth quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Greenfield","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"third quarter","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["BNB","CRYPTO"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
