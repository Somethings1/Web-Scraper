The markets are bleeding. Firms are laying off workers. Crypto exchange Coinbase even rescinded accepted job offers, blindsiding would-be employees. But the crypto job market is \u2026 still going strong?","Kind of.","Even three weeks ago, before the price of bitcoin tumbled below $30,000, Michael Shlayen, founder of BlockchainHeadhunter, said that \u201Coverall, there is a slowdown.\u201D He found that \u201Csome companies are putting a freeze on hiring.\u201D Then bitcoin crashed below $20,000. On June 23, Shlayen updated his assessment, saying that \u201Chiring slowed down even further and the job market has continued to cool off.\u201D","This interview is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.","But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all doom and gloom. Even after the price crash, Shlayen said that \u201Cthere are still some companies with healthy treasuries and lengthy runways who are continuing to hire ambitiously.\u201D","Other crypto recruiters and headhunters are seeing the same thing \u2013 or are even more optimistic. Three weeks ago, Daniel Adler, founder of Cryptocurrency Jobs, acknowledged that he was seeing a bit of a slowdown, but even after bitcoin plunged below $18,000, he updated his take to say that not much has changed, noting that \u201Cif anything, it seems things are stabilizing.\u201D","\u201CTeams have had time to adjust to market conditions and the macro environment, and so are able to make more informed decisions,\u201D he said June 21. He predicted that the Cryptocurrency Jobs will have more listings at the end of the month than it did at the beginning. (Are you reading this, Polymarket users?)","Emily Landon, another crypto recruiter, said she found that \u201Ca lot of our projects have put things on hold until they can see what\u2019s going on in the bear market.\u201D But even after the slump in prices, Landon said that \u201Cwe are getting great new business,\u201D meaning new clients and new job openings.","Adler said that while he\u2019s seeing a slowdown, that could also be the result of macro forces outside the blockchain industry.","Read More: What You Need to Know and Do to Get a Job in Crypto","\u201CCrypto is not immune from what\u2019s happening in the world,\u201D Adler said, citing the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and concerns about a global recession. \u201CThat\u2019s affecting crypto as well.\u201D He said that some companies have instituted hiring freezes. Plenty are \u201Cstill building, and it\u2019s business as usual.\u201D","What counts as \u201Cbusiness as usual?\u201D To put the recent cooldown in perspective, it helps to look more broadly at the last 18 months of the crypto job market.","\u201CThe last year and a half has been completely crazy,\u201D said Shlayen, who said he placed more candidates in the past 18 months than in the prior four years combined. For much of that time, he witnessed \u201Ca shift of professionals moving into the crypto space.\u201D","Just a few of the high-profile jumps from the \u201Cold world\u201D into crypto: Sherice Torres, the former chief marketing officer of Meta Platforms, Facebook\u2019s parent company, is now the CMO of payments company Circle. Brian Roberts hopped from Lyft, where he was the chief financial officer, to NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace OpenSea, where he holds the same position. Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital fund heavily investing in crypto, scooped up a glittering roster of all-star talent, including Bill Hinman (former director at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), Brent McIntosh (former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs) and Tomicah Tillemann (a policy wonk who used to be an adviser to President Biden) \u2013 not exactly crypto bros.","Read More: How to Get a Job in Crypto","While it\u2019s tough to quantify the precise size of the shift, a study from LinkedIn found that \u201Ccrypto-related job postings skyrocketed last year\u201D and \u201Cgrew 395% in the U.S. from 2020 to 2021, outpacing the wider tech industry, which saw a 98% increase.\u201D","Lawyers became crypto lawyers. Marketers became crypto marketers. And, um, writers have become crypto writers.","\u201CIt\u2019s hiring across all roles, and it\u2019s not just engineering.\u201D Adler said, adding that it was the \u201Cstrongest market I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201D He said that because so many crypto companies are well-funded and looking to expand, they had roles for \u201Cmarketing, operations, legal, finance, treasury, content \u2013 you name it.\u201D","So why are droves of workers making the jump to crypto? The first reason is obvious. Jenna Pilgrim, principal at Mayflower Strategic, another crypto headhunting firm, said that starting salaries are \u201Cpretty comparable\u201D to jobs at Silicon Valley and \u201Cmuch higher\u201D than jobs in financial services, with executives getting paid in the range of $250,000 to $400,000.","And that\u2019s just the base salary. Crypto jobs often come with a trove of tokens, said Shlayen, and those can be lucrative. \u201CIf the project succeeds, [total compensation] can be much higher than the actual salary. I\u2019ve seen some crazy packages.\u201D For example, Shlayen said that some of the jobs he has booked for clients \u2013 and not even at the executive level \u2013 have included $10,000 worth of tokens, and then those tokens \u201C100Xed.\u201D So that twentysomething engineer became a millionaire. At least, until a few weeks ago.","But money is only part of the lure.","\u201CWhen you look at the space, crypto is more optimistic and mission-driven,\u201D Adler said. He has found that crypto job-seekers truly care about the community and the memes and the GMs and the WAGMIs.","Whether these good vibes survive the price meltdown, of course, remains an open question, although Landon said that as recently as June 22, some companies are \u201Cstill growing and building.\u201D Others are drawn to the transparency of Web3, with a wealth of data auditable by anyone on public ledgers.","By contrast, when you work at traditional Web2 companies, it can be frustrating to be kept in the dark on the actual metrics of a site\u2019s performance. Are we really hitting our goals? Is senior leadership telling us the truth? \u201CBut in a Web3 space,\u201D Adler said. \u201CYou can look at a dashboard to see how many users are using the protocol.\u201D","Then there\u2019s the fact that crypto jobs \u2013 even if the money is the same \u2013 just strike many as more interesting than traditional roles.","\u201CYou can\u2019t disregard the intellectual curiosity,\u201D Adler said. Many of the job seekers, he said, are genuinely drawn to the sector\u2019s wide-ranging mix of economics, psychology, law, geopolitics, philosophy and the overall question of \u201Chow do you build systems that actually work?\u201D In other words, they are drawn to the same things that get people to read (or write) about crypto.","For the bulk of this hiring frenzy, it has not just been the twentysomething crypto bros who are riveted by these questions.","\u201CIt\u2019s a mix of all ages,\u201D Landon said. At the job market\u2019s peak, she was gaining 1,000 new LinkedIn followers each week and 50 new connection requests per day. A 72-year-old woman reached out to Landon for a crypto admin position, telling her that, \u201CMy son says it\u2019s the future, and I believe him.\u201D","At the other end of the spectrum, Landon works with 16-year-olds still in high school, and said that \u2018they\u2019re accepting job offers instead of going to college.\u201D","And in many cases, no crypto experience is required. \u201CA growing number of professionals are coming from other industries and looking to get into the Web3 world,\u201D Shlayen said.","Adler\u2019s inbox is often packed with direct messages from candidates with traditional jobs who are \u201Ccrypto curious\u201D and now want to work on it full time. He said this ranges from the chief of staff at a large bank to medical practitioners to blue-collar construction workers, and that is a point \u201CI want to hammer home \u2013 it\u2019s everyone,\u201D he said.","Read More: Coinbase Lays Off Around 1,100 Employees","As for the recent crash in prices, and the looming fears of a crypto winter? Adler has been connecting crypto candidates with crypto companies since 2017, and he said that even now \u2013 after the Celsius Network meltdown, with the drop in prices \u2013 it doesn\u2019t feel like the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019.","Adler said that from what he sees from a qualitative perspective, \u201CTeams are building, talent still wants to make the transition into crypto, and there's plenty of funding,\u201D he said.","Maybe the industry has matured. Maybe there\u2019s just more funding. Maybe company and project treasuries have wisely diversified their assets into fiat, cushioning the crash and giving them more runway.","Maybe. Or maybe we\u2019ll all soon be flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s.","It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies.","Crypto can make it faster and cheaper to pay workers.
