Good luck guys,\u201D writes Reddit user u\/flamingowax, referencing how the Bitcoin fork caused a lot of hype before crashing.","\u201CMost of the crypto \u2018community\u2019 share a common interest (albeit, a toxic one), and it\u2019s this ego-driven obsession of constant growth that can have a negative impact on us all.

Meanwhile, u\/bannercoin thinks this is all a scheme to drive TRX and BNB up: \u201CBNB and TRX both required to buy into the ICO. Now both of those tokens will get hit hard. What other reasons can Sun [Justin Sun, founder of Tron and CEO of BitTorrent] and CZ [Changpeng Zhao (CZ), CEO of Binance] come up with to keep scamming people into buying TRX and BNB?\u201D","The most common reply to the news of the sale, however, is simple disbelief in the value of BTT: \u201C[Don\u2019t worry] guys, we\u2019ll be able to buy it 80% below ICO price,\u201D says u\/YouPoro. \u201C\u2018Only 962 participants got into sale, buying the bulk of the vaporware tokens.\u2019 Will dump at a premium on retail market,\u201D believes u\/CryptoToit.","Meanwhile, the CEO of Binance announced that \u201CTron team generously agreed to do a small airdrop\u201D:","Separately, on February 11th, 2019, BitTorrent Foundation will initiate its first airdrop of BTT to TRON holders.","Also, BitTorrent warned that it \u201Cregistered an important number of fraudulent websites, ICOs, and airdrops offering so called BitTorrent (BTT).\u201D","Yesterday, January 28th at UTC 3 PM, two separate sale sessions for BTT started on the Binance Launchpad \u2013 one for investors paying with Tron\u2019s TRX token, and the other for those paying with Binance\u2019s BNB token.
