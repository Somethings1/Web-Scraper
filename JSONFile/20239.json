Lightning Network May be the Answer","category":["Bitcoin News "],"content":["\nA long-held view in both crypto markets and traditional financial markets is that in order to earn an interest on oneâ\u20AC™s assets, custody of those assets must be given up to a third-party. But with bitcoin (BTC)â\u20AC™s Lightning Network (LN), a new model for earning a non-custodial â\u20ACœLightning Network Reference Rateâ\u20AC\u009D (LNRR) has emerged, one author argues.","According to Nik Bhatia, an adjunct professor of finance at the University of Southern California and author of the book Layered Money, the market for so-called routing fees on bitcoinâ\u20AC™s Lightning Network could in the future serve as the first form of â\u20ACœcounterparty-free incomeâ\u20AC\u009D for owners of capital.","â\u20ACœThe smart contracts within LN allow its participants to establish a market for routing fees, and routers can earn a bitcoin-denominated return without ever relinquishing complete control of the underlying capital,â\u20AC\u009D Bhatia wrote in a recent blog article on bitcoin interest rates.","He added that in traditional financial markets, returns can never be earned without trusting capital to a counterparty.","â\u20ACœHow can a corporation, for example, return income to investors without initially taking outside capital into its own custody? Impossible,â\u20AC\u009D the popular author wrote.","But while Lightning Network routing fees can be earned without giving up custody of the bitcoins that are deployed, they are still not an entirely risk-free interest rate like government bonds are usually considered to be in the traditional financial system. The network is young, and unknown risks or security loopholes may exist.","Further, routing fees are not the only interest rate that can be derived from a future bitcoin economy, the author argued.","Other potential sources of income in a future bitcoin economy could also include fees from coin mixing, bitcoin futures funding rates, or exchange deposits and lending. However, the notable difference here is that all of these activities do involve some form of counterparty risk.","Combined, all of these rates can form a â\u20ACœrobust yield curveâ\u20AC\u009D in the bitcoin market, which will evolve into investment strategies entirely based on â\u20ACœthe diversified bitcoin rates complex,â\u20AC\u009D Bhatia concluded.","In the past, other attempts at establishing a risk-free interest rate for bitcoin akin to the yield curve for US and European government bonds have mostly focused on the regulated futures market for bitcoin.","Among these, one research article by Quantpedia.com looked at the rate that could be earned by going long on the front-month bitcoin futures contract on the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), while simultaneously going short on the longest dated (back-month) contract.","This would create a position that would not be exposed to the price swings in bitcoin, but instead take advantage of the price difference between futures contracts of different maturity.","And although the counterparty risk may be small in this case given that the CME is a regulated futures exchange, the risk is still there, and no returns can be generated without giving up custody of the bitcoins.","Others, meanwhile, agree with Bhatiaâ\u20AC™s take that the only counterparty-free interest rate on bitcoin is the one that can be derived from Lightning Network routing fees.","According to Patrick Heusser, head of trading at the digital asset brokerage Crypto Finance, a â\u20ACœLightning Network Reference Rateâ\u20AC\u009D could even have implications for the pricing of bitcoin derivatives. This is because the rate means that the â\u20ACœopportunity cost of Bitcoin becomes measurableâ\u20AC\u009D","And judging from Heusserâ\u20AC™s research, a Lightning Network Reference Rate could in fact have even lower risk than the assets typically considered risk-free in traditional finance.","â\u20ACœThe Lightning Network, controversially, and the resulting LNRR is associated with less risks if the necessary knowledge is available to deal with the operational risks,â\u20AC\u009D Heusser argued, before finally adding:","â\u20ACœNevertheless, it is surely not wrong to consider the LNRR as risk-free if your unit of account is Bitcoin.â\u20AC\u009D","In other words, it appears that fees from bitcoinâ\u20AC™s Lightning Network may have a real chance at becoming the first-ever reference rate that is both risk-free and counterparty-free at the same time.","The old wisdom, which Bhatia summarized by saying that â\u20ACœreturns are never earned without sending capital to a counterpartyâ\u20AC\u009D could thus be about to be turned on its head.","____","Learn more:","\u2013 DeFi Unlocked: How to Earn Interest Lending Crypto using Aave\n\u2013 6 Ways to Earn Passive Income with Crypto\n\n\u2013 How to Earn Crypto Investment Income on Uniswap\n\u2013 How to Earn Crypto Investment Income on Compound\n\n\u2013 Interest in Bitcoin Futures Trading Rise Sharply as BTC Breaches USD 57K\n\u2013 Crypto Adoption in 2022: What to Expect?\n\n ",""],"entity":[{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Earn Passive Income","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lightning Network Reference Rate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chicago Mercantile Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nik Bhatia","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Patrick Heusser","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the University of Southern California","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC Breaches USD 57K\n\u2013 Crypto Adoption","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto\n\n\u2013 How to Earn Crypto Investment Income on Uniswap\n\u2013 How to Earn Crypto Investment Income on Compound\n\n\u2013 Interest","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CME","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Earn Interest Lending Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bhatia","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","Investing","Lightning Network"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
