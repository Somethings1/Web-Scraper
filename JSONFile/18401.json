This is because of the level of control a control one man or company can have on the process.","\u201CI like Elon Musk, today he has a commitment to freedom of speech and expression. I\u2019m not naïve enough to believe that it\u2019s absolute. I\u2019m not naïve enough to believe I\u2019m always going to be on the right side.

They offer users absolute control of the governing mechanism and their data getting rid of centralized bodies.","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin hailed the development of Farcaster in recent weeks for web3 users.","\u201Cfeels like it\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s quite usable as a Twitter alternative for lots of people. The channels thing actually makes it *better* in many ways imo. That said, spam is increasing; I think dealing with that well is the next challenge.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hoskinson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Feb 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 19, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bluesky","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cardano Charles Hoskinson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Charles Hoskinson","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Cardano","Decentralization","Hoskinson"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
