A future improvement involves data availability sampling (DAS), potentially expanding the data space per slot to 16 MB. At the same time, the network is poised to continue its Layer 2-centric scaling strategy.&nbsp;","Scaling has been an issue for Ethereum for several years now. Hence development teams and startups have put forward a smorgasbord of approaches to tackling the issue, at both the protocol level and through a system of layers.","Major scaling upgrades are being developed in parallel. First up is EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding, a precursor to sharding, that was recently implemented. It introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/285236\/inscriptions-push-blobs-to-reach-set-utilization-limit-on-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data blobs<\/a>, which increase the amount of data Ethereum blocks can hold. By increasing the amount of data each block can hold, it has helped reduce costs for Layer 2s.","Next up is sharding, which has been in development since Vitalik Buterin <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@socialmedia_63108\/vitalik-buterin-lays-roadmap-for-ethereum-visa-levels-quadratic-sharding-7478e769808f\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">introduced<\/a> it in 2017 and will be implemented in future. It involves splitting the Ethereum blockchain so that subsets of validators are only responsible for a fraction of the total data.","Yet another proposed development introduces <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alchemy.com\/overviews\/proposer-builder-separation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposer builder separation (PBS)<\/a>. This concept could separate the highly intensive work of block building from more passive block validation. Proposer builder separation will ensure an adequate number of validators for decentralization and data availability sampling on the post-sharded Ethereum network."],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM","VITALIK BUTERIN"]}
