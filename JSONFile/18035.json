On Thursday, the National Police Agency of South Korea sent a letter to the Secretariat of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) requesting aid in extraditing Kwon from a Montenegro jail.","This followed a High Court ruling earlier this week that revoked a prior ruling to extradite the crypto mogul to the United States, given misinformation about the order in which South Korea and the U.S. filed their petitions. Before this, the U.S. extradition had been approved twice by a lower court.","","Both nations are seeking out Kwon on charges related to his now-defunct Terra blockchain, an algorithmic stablecoin network whose spectacular blowup wiped out $44 billion of investor value in May 2022. Contagion around the blowup triggered more high-profile collapses at firms like Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, and FTX.","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has since slapped Kwon with a litany of charges for deliberately defrauding investors, including by selling the platform\u2019s native LUNA token as an unregistered security.","An extradition to South Korea would be a win for Kwon, the country being a preference among Kwon\u2019s lawyers, and more likely to offer him a lighter punishment.","According to Terrence Yang, Managing Director at Swan Bitcoin, extradition to South Korea would be a \u201Ctravesty\u201D for victims seeking proper justice.","\u201CThe US probably has the largest number of victims by both number and dollar amount,\u201D Yang said. \u201CIt seems a bit ridiculous for the Montenegro court to extradite Do Kwon to South Korea, where he might get acquitted or a comically light sentence as opposed to the United States.\u201D","A U.S. court has already convicted FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of multiple counts of fraud, for which he will potentially face decades behind bars.","A group of South Korean Terra investors have also called for Kwon to be extradited to the U.S. where they say he will face \u201Cproper punishment.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"High Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Three Arrows Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"National Police Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Justice Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Swan Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"South Korean Terra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Yang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Secretariat of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$44 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Terrence Yang","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Do Kwon","South Korea","T"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
