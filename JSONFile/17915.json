Back in March this year, the game platform also hosted the annual Coinfest Conference on its platform, which made the move to the virtual world thanks to the COVID-19 lockdowns across the world.","Originally launched through an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, Decentraland\u2019s virtual world officially opened in February this year, after years of development. As of now, however, the platform has over 12,000 users and comprises 90,000 parcels of virtual land that players can buy and sell.","At pixel time (11:50 UTC), MANA trades at USD 0.04 and is down by 3% in a day, trimming its weekly gains to 5%.
