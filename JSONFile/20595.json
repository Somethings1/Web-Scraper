He said the asset will not achieve its marketed role as an inflation hedge or a store of value until its user base surpasses 1 billion.","\u201CRight now, it\u2019s going to be way more volatile than people like,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd people look at it as a risk-on or risk-off trade until we get to that adoption.\u201D","His comments came before Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 on Friday amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. The drop followed reports of an Israeli missile strike on Iran.","According to ABC News, Israel launched missiles in a retaliatory strike against Iran early Friday. Iran\u2019s Fars news agency reported hearing three explosions near a military base in Isfahan, a central city. An Iranian official reportedly refuted claims of a missile attack, attributing the explosions to the activation of Iran\u2019s air defense systems.","During geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, investors tend to become more cautious and seek safer assets to protect their investments. Traditionally, they turn to assets like gold and government bonds for safety.","Scaramucci went on to express optimism regarding Bitcoin\u2019s long-term prospects. He anticipates factors like the recent Spot ETF launch, the entry of major financial institutions, and the upcoming halving event to potentially propel Bitcoin\u2019s value toward $200,000.","Additionally, he dismissed concerns about excessive centralization due to ETFs. Scaramucci argues that current institutional ownership, including BlackRock, represents a relatively small portion of the overall Bitcoin market, less than 10%.","Scaramucci\u2019s most recent price prediction for Bitcoin exceeds his prior forecast. Earlier this year, he projected that Bitcoin could surge to $170,000 by mid-to-late 2025, assuming it maintained a price of above $45,000 at the time of the halving.","The Bitcoin network undergoes a technical event known as a halving, which serves to decrease the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation.","Scheduled to occur between April 19 and 20, this event reduces the miner reward for verifying transactions by 50%. This halving mechanism will continue until the total number of Bitcoins in circulation reaches its capped supply of 21m."],"entity":[{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ABC News","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SkyBridge Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Anthony Scaramucci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fars","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Israel","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$45,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$200,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Isfahan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$170,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Scaramucci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Iran","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Anthony Scaramucci","Bitcoin Price"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
