This could happen \u201Cas Bitcoin assumes its position as an anti-inflationary store of value,\u201D the report said.","However, the authors of the report also noted that a different and more bearish scenario could playout for the sector. In this scenario, continued inflation could force central banks to raise interest rates, which could lead to outflows from crypto and into \u201Cmore defensive investment classes.\u201D This is also true for the stock market, which bitcoin is likely to follow as it becomes \u201Cmore institutionalized,\u201D the report said.","Next, CryptoCompare said the least likely scenario, which still remains a possibility, is that crypto decouples from traditional financial markets due to factor specific to the nascent space. This could be driven by things like extensive innovation and a growing ecosystem that has the potential to impact cryptoasset prices regardless of the macroeconomic backdrop.","Further, in its outlook report for 2022, they touched on the currently hot discussion of where we currently stand in the crypto market cycle, with many market participants arguing that the bull market is not over since no \u201Cblow-off top\u201D has been seen yet.","The report noted that the camp that believes in the 4-year cycles \u2013 which roughly fall in line with bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle \u2013 is correct that the classic \u201Cblow-off top\u201D has yet to be seen. However, it also pointed to others who argue that the cycle theory is wrong, and that past cycles are merely coincidences. Based on this, \u201Cit may be the case that crypto is currently in a bear market after the aforementioned fall in November and December,\u201D the report said.","Meanwhile, the report predicted that the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem will become more institutionalized in the new year, just as traditional cryptoassets have seen increased adoption by institutions in 2020 and 2021, as illustrated by veteran investors like Paul Tudor Jones entering bitcoin.","\u201CWe expect this trend to accelerate in the coming years. There are many optimists out there in this regard, most famously the CEO of Ark Invest, Cathie Wood, who in October stated that \u2018the move by institutions into Bitcoin\u2026could add USD 500,000 to Bitcoin\u2019s price if they moved into the tune of roughly 5% [of their portfolio] over time\u2019,\u201D the report said.","Lastly, CryptoCompare pointed to retail adoption of crypto in emerging countries as a key factor driving the asset class forward.","It said it expects emerging markets in Latin America, Asia, and Africa to see an even faster rate of crypto adoption in 2022, citing \u201Cdire economic challenges\u201D and high inflation in many developing countries.\n___\nLearn more: \n\u2013 How Global Economy Might Affect Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Crypto in 2022\n\u2013 Bitcoin, Ethereum Could Benefit If Stocks Drop After Fed Tightening \u2013 Strategist\n\n\u2013 Arthur Hayes Tells Crypto Traders \u2018It Pays to Wait,\u2019 Stronger USD Coming\n\n\u2013 Blame Fed and Leveraged Traders for This Crypto Selloff\n\u2013 Global Debt Reaches a Record USD 226 Trillion"],"entity":[{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Latin America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Could Benefit If Stocks Drop After Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arthur Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD Coming\n\n\u2013 Blame Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CryptoCompare","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cathie Wood","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Paul Tudor Jones","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Central Bank","Cryptocurrency","Economics","Forecast","Investing"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
