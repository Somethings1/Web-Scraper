We built DeSo Identity as an embeddable iFrame,\u201D Al-Naji said, adding that raw seed phrases are also not a suitable option.","As previously reported, Al-Naji is also the creator of a controversial decentralized social media protocol on the DeSo blockchain, Bitclout, which he claimed was created \u201Cas an early prototype.\u201D Following the launch of DeSo, the CLOUT token was renamed to DESO.","Notably, DeSo saw a private token sale worth over USD 200m to high-profile investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Social Capital, TQ Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, Blockchain.com, and a number of other well-known names in the crypto-focused venture capital space.Â ","Further detailing the new feature, Al-Naji said that the \u201CLogin with Google\u201D uses a seed phrase but backs it up to Google Drive. He added that users who prefer not to use this new feature can still sign up with a seed phrase.","If you still want the security and anonymity of a raw seed phrase, without Google, you can have it. Just click the \u201CSign Up with Seed Phrase\u201D button\n\nIf you want the full security of Metamask, then using DeSo Identity on mobile or in Incognito on desktop roughly achieves that","However, the crypto community did not welcome this new functionality with open arms, pointing out that the backed seed phrase into Google Drive can be easily deleted or even hacked.","\u201CLet\u2019s put a global file titled \u201Cseed phrase\u201D on every person\u2019s google account. This way, any computer you might accidentally log into and forget to sign off on, or any scammy app that asks you to \u201Csign in with google\u201D and reads your files, can steal your coins,\u201D said Ben Simon, a partner and head of research at Mechanism Capital, a US-based venture capital investment firm.","Other users mentioned that with this, the platform is further receding from crypto\u2019s core ethos of decentralization.","Raised $200m from VCs and now prompt users to enter their seed phrases into web extensions ðŸ˜‚\n\nNGMI ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ https:\/\/t.co\/iC7KrkdTTu","__","just as a thought experiment in some alternate universe where starting today everyone's bitcoin private keys had to be stored on Google Drive because reasons [just accept the premise] how long would it be before Google Drive would completely compromised in every possible way https:\/\/t.co\/iyzfzmY8PN","As reported, the project\u2019s creator, formerly known only by his pseudonym Diamondhands, is a former Google engineer who also founded the stablecoin start-up Basis, which shut its doors in 2018.","Meanwhile, DESO seems unaffected by the news. At 9:23 UTC Monday morning, the coin is trading at USD 76.98, up by 1.3% over the past 24 hours, and down 14.7% over the past week according to CoinGecko.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Altcoin Traders Get a New Darling as Bitclout Creator Launches DeSo\n\u2013 BitClout Investors Coinbase & Blockchain.com Step Up Their Shilling EffortsÂ \n\n\u2013 Prominent Crypto Players Increasingly Angry With Heavily-Backed BitClout\n\u2013 Decentralized dYdX Went Down Due to Reliance on Centralized Cloud Services\n\n\u2013 Cryptoverse & Busta Rhymes Point Out Flaws in Facebook\u2019s Centralized System\n\u2013 Decentralization in Crypto Is a Hard to Measure Ideal"],"entity":[{"type":"14.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Al","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ben Simon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Andreessen Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Diamondhands","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google Drive","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Winklevoss Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BitClout Investors Coinbase & Blockchain.com","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Naji","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"TQ Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DeSo Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Incognito","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitclout","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reliance on Centralized Cloud Services\n\n\u2013 Cryptoverse & Busta Rhymes Point","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$200m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sequoia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Coinbase Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New Darling","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Naji","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinGecko","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Decentralization","Google","Social media"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
