We\u2019re served up ads that are annoying. We\u2019re always accepting cookies. We\u2019re being tracked. We\u2019re leaking data. And we can\u2019t escape the tractor beam of the Googles and Facebooks of the world.","What if there\u2019s a better way?","The promise of \u201CWeb3 marketing\u201D is more than just a niche interest for ad execs. It could transform how all of us use the internet, how we consume media, and how we interact with our favorite movies and NBA players and coffee shops and whiskey labels.","This feature is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.","Just as bitcoin removed the middleman of banks to offer peer-to-peer transactions, Web3 marketing could bypass Google and Facebook to let brands build relationships directly with consumers. A Web3 marketing framework, in theory, could preserve privacy, allow for better targeting, and even share revenue back to the users. \u201CGoogle and Facebook don\u2019t want to do this. They don\u2019t have to,\u201D says Dan Novaes, the Founder and CEO of Mode Mobile. \u201CThey\u2019re giants. They\u2019re behemoths. The issue with Web2 marketing is that you\u2019re SOL if you don\u2019t play nice with those products.\u201D","Novaes has been studying the alignment of customers and brands for years--ever since high school, when he launched an e-commerce company that swelled to $2 million, in part by scooping up wholesale electronics in the U.S. and then flipping them overseas for higher prices. (This was a simpler time.)","Years before anyone used the term \u201CWeb3,\u201D Novaes hatched a project that rewarded users for doing everyday tasks, like watching videos or reading the news: Mode Mobile. People liked it. Using a custom smartphone, the \u201CEarnOS\u201D lets you stream music and get paid for it, hence the tagline \u201Cturning smartphones into earnphones.\u201D Mode Mobile was named as Deloitte\u2019s #1 fastest growing software company, has over 10 million downloads on the Google Play store, and claims to have helped users earn and save over $250 million. More importantly, the model lets brands reach consumers directly\u2026 without forking over rent to Google or Facebook.","In the Web2 world this is hard to do. \u201C90% or more of the whole market for advertising is being monopolized by Google, Facebook, and a few other companies,\u201D says Filip Wielanier, co-founder and CEO of Cookie3. \u201CWe believe that we should decentralize this kind of distribution.\u201D","This distribution of ads comes from creators. Less Big Tech, more micro-influencers. Creators like singers, comedians, and KOLs would be compensated by the brand, and then the creators would hawk the product. Wielanier\u2019s team is building out the \u201CCookie3 affiliate\u201D and a Cookie DAO to build this infrastructure.","As Cookie3 described in a recent Twitter\/X thread, Web2 marketing is top-down, centralized, and one-way communication. Web3 is bottom-up, tokenized, transparent, and data-driven. Web3 marketing would also solve the vexing problem of, well, cookies.","It can feel as if we spend half our time on the internet clicking \u201CAccept Cookies.\u201D This has become as mindless as clicking \u201CAccept Terms and Conditions\u201D when downloading software updates. We bristle at being tracked but we click \u201CYes\u201D because we have no choice. But what\u2019s mildly annoying for you and me is an almost existential problem for digital marketers.","Let\u2019s say you want to serve an ad that targets 21-to-34-year-old males in Kentucky. You don\u2019t waste money spamming the entire United States, so you use cookies to refine your audience. The problem is that cookies are only a clunky workaround. \u201CThe cookie is a non-persistent item inside of your browser,\u201D says Chris Outram, Head of Blockchain at Publicis Media. \u201CIt\u2019s built for storing log-in data.\u201D","Outram calls cookies \u201Cbrittle,\u201D as some browsers don\u2019t store cookies, users can refuse cookies, and cookies were never really intended as the key link in a marketing campaign. They\u2019re simply all we have.","With Web3? In theory, says Outram, we\u2019d dramatically change the infrastructure of the internet, swapping these brittle cookies with something more useful \u2013 and privacy preserving \u2013 to both brands and users alike. The details are still a whopping TBD but this will likely involve zero-knowledge proofs, where you can signal to brands your interests without revealing the rest of your online behavior. \u201CThat\u2019s the magic unlock,\u201D says Outram. \u201CWe can parse out the data we give as consumers.\u201D","There are other unlocks. From the brand\u2019s perspective, they could reward users with a token that would give true ownership, strengthening that connection. \u201CThe moment you can take people and have them be an owner inside of a network, they\u2019re no longer a customer. They\u2019re an ambassador,\u201D says Novaes. \u201CAnd they talk and act in a very different way.\u201D This is why Novaes\u2019 project now includes the Web3 token $EARNM (as in \u201CEarn\u2019M\u201D). His Web2 goal was to turn users into earners; now his Web3 goal is \u201Cto turn earners into owners.\u201D","As anyone who has spent much time in Web3 knows, token-holding can build communities and loyalty. (See: WAGMI.) This is mana for brands. As uber-VC Chris Dixon once said, \u201CWhen somebody owns something and feels skin in the game, they want to go talk about it. They want to evangelize it.\u201D","Novaes gives a surprising example from his own Mode Mobile and EARNM community. As outlined on its website, users of EARNM can earn prizes such as a Toyota Corolla, a Lamborghini, or even the world\u2019s biggest cookie. But these aren\u2019t the prizes that stand out. Consider \u201CPrize #5: Harness the Power of a Troll Army.\u201D","How does one harness a Troll Army? Novaes explains that his mailing list has over one million people and they are so engaged \u2013 so aligned \u2013 that they would happily follow instructions and troll an intended target. \u201CIf I sent one email to my user base, and I was like, \u2018Go on Jeff\u2019s Twitter and put these emojis\u2026\u2019\u201D The army would do it. (Novaes clarifies that the trolling needs to be legal.)","But the trolling isn\u2019t really the point. It\u2019s easy to see how a Troll Campaign could get toxic in the wrong hands \u2013 or maybe even the right hands \u2013 but the larger takeaway is that the community is hyper-engaged and hyper-loyal. (See also: XRP Army.) Every brand covets this. \u201CYou have an army that\u2019s aligned with you,\u201D says Novaes. \u201CThat\u2019s really, really powerful.\u201D","This is not to say that Web3 marketing is a silver bullet. It can backfire; it has backfired. \u201CThere are aspects of Web3 that are super messed up, and not sustainable,\u201D says Novaes, as some Web3 projects only worked in the short-term by showering users with freebies. Who\u2019s paying for this marketing? Often the rewards come from either a soaring token price or the project\u2019s capital. The problem is that prices can fall and capital runs out. \u201CThe Axie Infinity thing will happen over and over again,\u201D says Novaes, predicting that the recent trend of air-drops is \u201Cnot sustainable.\u201D","Novaes\u2019 project, EARNM, tries to tackle this problem with a clever system of \u201Cmystery boxes\u201D as rewards. Instead of just doling out tokens to all, users pay a minting fee to unlock the mystery boxes (which contain different types of prizes), and these minting fees inject revenue into the system and create a deflationary pressure. Then the rewards inside the mystery boxes have different \u201Cvesting periods,\u201D intended to make the tokenomics more sustainable.","Philosophical merits of decentralization aside, there\u2019s another very concrete problem with the current state of Web2 marketing: It\u2019s no longer very effective. \u201CIt\u2019s hard to cut through the noise,\u201D says Novaes. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a startup and your new killer product is in the App Store. \u201CIf you launch an app, it\u2019s not even a pin-drop,\u201D says Novaes. \u201CPeople don\u2019t care. Your attention is getting spammed by so many different things. And that\u2019s why the cost to acquire users is only going up.\u201D","Yes, this is all still very theoretical and yes, it\u2019s unclear how regulations and legal concerns will complicate innovation. But it\u2019s also true that new Web3 products \u2013 in theory \u2013 could give marketers a shiny new tool kit\u2026and something that consumers would actually enjoy.","To illustrate the potential of Web3 marketing, Outram gives the contrasting example of a \u201Chamburger coupon\u201D vs. \u201Cwhiskey ambassador.\u201D In traditional Web2 marketing you might give a customer a $1 coupon for a hamburger. But that\u2019s boring. Not even hamburger lovers would really care. So imagine this model instead\u2026","\u201CI like whiskey,\u201D says Outram. \u201CAnd I can prove that I have a really good sense of what good whiskey is. If you\u2019re a high-end whiskey provider, don\u2019t you want me out there in front of your brand?\u201D So how do you prove you know your whiskey? (Most ways of proving your whiskey palate are decidedly offline.)","Thanks to the new tools of Web3, says Outram, perhaps you could show some on-chain proof that you attended a whiskey tasting, or proof that you bought certain barrels. And because this is all privacy-preserving, you\u2019d let brands see it. \u201CI would permit any whiskey brand to see my on-chain customer journey,\u201D says Outram. \u201CI\u2019m signaling to them, \u2018hey, come to me.\u2019\u201D","This is a better version of a cookie. This is a better version of the brand-customer relationship. This is a better version of the internet.","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Troll Army","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$250 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jeff\u2019s Twitter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Novaes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$EARNM","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Head of Blockchain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dan Novaes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"XRP Army","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cookie DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NBA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Big Tech","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Chris Outram","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Facebook","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Toyota Corolla","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Outram","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chris Dixon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Publicis Media","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kentucky","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Filip Wielanier","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Deloitte","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Features","Web3 Marketing 2024"],"authors":["Jeff Wilser"]}
