It was a well-thought out plan that required several active decisions by the former CEO, knowing that they were criminal, a jury found last year.","In November, Bankman-Fried's jury convicted him on seven different charges: committing and conspiring to commit wire fraud on FTX customers; committing and conspiring to commit wire fraud on Alameda Research's lenders; conspiring to commit securities and commodities fraud against FTX's customers and conspiring to commit money laundering to hide the proceeds of wire fraud on FTX's customers.","Ellison, although by far the most anticipated and important witness in the trial, wasn\u2019t the only person in Bankman-Fried\u2019s close circle that turned on him.","Co-founder of FTX and chief technology officer Gary Wang and former engineering head Nishad Singh were two other key witnesses who took the stand for several days to talk about their involvement in the scheme.","Wang said that special privileges were given to Alameda Research which were written directly into the code. Singh confirmed that statement, and gave more details about how exactly money was moved, the code worked and other things, including Bankman-Fried\u2019s lavish spending.","Despite all of that, Bankman-Fried seemed to remain hopeful throughout the trial and eventually took the stand himself. However, it quickly became clear that he wasn\u2019t ready to answer fully. Instead, oftentimes he claimed he wouldn\u2019t remember certain things he didn\u2019t seem to want to answer. Prosecutors also pointed out several times that his statements were contradicting things that he had said before. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t go well.","On November 3, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.","Last month, the defense urged Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversees the case, to consider a sentence of six years, arguing that FTX creditors are likely to get the majority of their funds back.","Prosecutors called the proposal \u201Cwoefully inadequate\u201D and recommended that Bankman-Fried be sentenced to 40-50 years in prison, but the decision is ultimately up to Judge Kaplan.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing starts at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time today.","\u2014 Helene Braun","Sam Bankman-Fried's sentencing hearing kicks off in a few short hours.
