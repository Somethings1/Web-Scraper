This Thursday (November 11th) the L2 solution Optimism is set to release one of its biggest upgrades which will, among other things, greatly improve the developer experience building on Optimism,\u201D according to crypto analysis firm Coin Metrics. ","Layer 1 (L1) is the base protocol (the Ethereum blockchain), while L2 is any protocol built on top of Ethereum.","Decentralized finance (DeFi) startup Optimism announced \u201Cthe biggest update in Optimistic Ethereum\u2019s history: OVM 2.0\u201D in September, as \u201Cthe simplest, cheapest, and fastest version of OE [Optimistic Ethereum] yet.\u201D Then in late October, they described it as \u201Ca new gold standard for L2s.\u201D","Per this Twitter thread, Optimistic Ethereum will become the first [Ethereum virtual machine] Equivalent L2, which meant that almost all of their custom code will be cut out \u201Cin favor of simply using an existing Ethereum client \u2014 Geth.\u201D","EVM Equivalence is powerful enough that we think other L2s will have to adopt the same pattern. This is a good thing for Ethereum as a whole \u2014 it means we can start to standardize L2 architectures. And standardization means more progress for less effort.","Meanwhile, as reported in mid-July, Optimism launched the long-awaited Alpha L2 solution for major decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap (UNI) through the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet.","A solution can\u2019t come fast enough as Ethereum gas fees are back on the rise with activity on the network picking up. ","As of Tuesday this week, the 7-day moving average of the mean Ethereum transaction fee stood at USD 47.7, down from a peak of USD 52 a week earlier, according to data from BitInfoCharts.","Coin Metrics wrote in its latest State of the Network report that some activities have now become prohibitively expensive on Ethereum.","\u201CEven after adjusting for the rise in ETH\u2019s price in USD terms, fees are still increasing in native units. The high fees are starting to price out certain economic activity such as small transfers under [USD] 100 in value that have dropped off with the increase in fees,\u201D the report said.","Further, the firm also said that unlike this summer, when high gas prices plagued the Ethereum network as non-fungible token (NFT) trading took off, the digital art pieces are likely not to blame for the latest rise in fees.","The reason Coin Metrics cited for this is that daily transfers of ERC-721 tokens \u2013 the standard that NFTs are built on \u2013 is down from a peak of about 200,000 per day in early September to an average of 67,000 over the last week.","Instead, the report hinted that trading on DEXs could be a contributing factor, describing this activity as \u201Cless cost-sensitive.\u201D Specifically, it cited an uptick in the number of trades and unique buyers in recent weeks on Uniswap.","In addition to DEX trading, however, the recent meme coin mania may also be playing a role, given that the recently hot, self-proclaimed \u201Cdogecoin killer,\u201D shiba inu (SHIB), is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token.","\u201CFor example, on October 28th over 100K ETH addresses interacted with SHIB while 133K transactions involved the token that day, ~9% of the 1.5M ETH transactions that day,\u201D Coin Metrics said.","The analysis firm further noted that high gas fees remain \u201Ca double-edged sword\u201D for Ethereum. On one side, it is a sure sign that activity on the protocol is high, indicating strong user demand, but on the other, as noted, the fees are \u201Cpricing out\u201D certain actors and activities.","At press time (12:37 UTC) on Wednesday, ETH traded at USD 4,746, down just under 1% for the past 24 hours and up 3.2% for the week.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Ethereum and Uniswap Tank Despite Optimism News\n\u2013 DYDX Soars as Protocol Sees Trading Volume Double That of Coinbase\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Tests All-Time High as On-Chain Activity Grows, SHIB Burns ETH\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 Helped Coinbase Save ETH 27 on Daily Fees\n\n\u2013 USD 0.5 Million Paid in Failed Ethereum Transaction\n\u2013 DeversiFi Explains What Caused the USD 23M Transaction Fee on Ethereum\n\n\u2013 Altcoins in for a Bumper 2022 as Number of Crypto Traders Set to Double \u2013 Report\n\u2013 Altcoins Eclipse Combined Bitcoin, Ethereum Transaction Volumes on Coinbase"],"entity":[{"type":"Ethereum Transaction Volumes on Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Burns","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday this week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Uniswap Tank Despite Optimism News\n\u2013 DYDX Soars as Protocol Sees Trading Volume Double That of Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Number of Crypto Traders","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"mid-July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1559","content":"DATE"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Optimistic Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD 23M Transaction","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","DEX","Dogecoin","Ethereum","Fees","Market","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Shiba inu","Uniswap"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
