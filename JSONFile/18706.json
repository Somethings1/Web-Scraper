So, do I care about the overall XRP market? 100%,\u201D the Ripple CEO was quoted as saying.","And while the company often reiterates that XRP is important to them, other comments from the CEO also suggested that Ripple is looking beyond the payments sector as it seeks to expand its offering in the blockchain space, comparing Ripple to ecommerce giant Amazon once again.","\u201CAmazon started as a bookseller and just sold books. We happen to have started with payments. Two years from now, you\u2019re going to find that Ripple is to payments as Amazon was to books,\u201D the CEO told the Financial Times.","Among these new projects is also the content monetization platform Coil, which Ripple handed out USD 260 million to, with most of the funds earmarked as grants to attract content creators to join the platform.","Now, after a year of running Coil, the platform appears to be generating little returns, with one writer on the platform saying the payments he had been able to generate for attracting readers only made up about USD 15 since the start of the year, although he had received USD 2,250 in XRP from Coil as an incentive to keep writing on the platform.","Meanwhile, in related news, Ripple partner Flare Networks revealed this week that it is launching a new token that XRP holders can claim on a one-to-one basis. According to the announcement from Flare Networks\u2019 CEO Hugo Philion, the new tokens, dubbed Spark, are designed to enable smart contract functionality for XRP users.","At pixel time (10:52 UTC), XRP trades at USD 0.276 and is down by 3% in a day and 8% in a week, trimming its monthly gains to less than 40%. The price is down by 6% in a year.\n___","Learn more:\nXRP Jumps As Ripple Sees Stronger Demand From Institutions\nXRP & Ripple Slammed Too as Team Bitcoin Expands Ethereum Battle"],"entity":[{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Amazon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Garlinghouse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Team Bitcoin Expands Ethereum Battle","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Brad Garlinghouse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Flare Networks","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Hugo Philion","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ripple","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Financial Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"XRP","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Banking","Financial Services","Ripple","XRP"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
