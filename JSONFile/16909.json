Dance music pulsed out of a purple-lit marble facade. Foreigners pressed past hired muscle.","Locals gawked at this mysterious gala. What spectacle had taken over Commerce Square, they wondered, and why were its guests talking about crypto coins? They stared at a banner: \u201CSOLANA BREAKPOINT.\u201D","Solana\u2019s opulent conference wrapped with a bang late Wednesday after three breakneck days of panelists and parties meant, as the event website put it, to be a \u201Ccelebration\u201D of the network\u2019s rapid ascent. Some 2,000 attendees had come to discuss the future: of finance, digital ownership, governance, trading, social media and online communities.","Most seemed to believe that blockchains and tokens \u2013 specifically Solana\u2019s \u2013 were primed to disrupt it all. Mainstream crypto, they said in panels and party chatter, was within reach.","It was a coming-out party for a network racing moonward. After months of SOL\u2019s market cap soaring, Solana, a fast and cheap hub for decentralized finance (DeFi), is seeing talent and capital flow into projects \u2013 spanning non-fungible tokens (NFT), derivatives, lending, staking, trading and more. Solana\u2019s top brass joked that the projects were spawning too quickly to count.","\u201CWe want to see 1 billion people using the network,\u201D Solana Labs COO Raj Gokal said on opening day. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko estimated the network\u2019s active accounts at around 1.25 million.","Mass crypto adoption has been a constant refrain in Lisbon this autumn. Since mid-October the Portuguese capital has hosted a blockchain week, an Ethereum convention, a NEAR event, a generalist web conference and a Cosmos summit \u2013 with Solana Breakpoint bookending the lot.","Solana\u2019s attendees felt fundamentally different, a handful of exhausted event-hoppers told CoinDesk. If those earlier community-organized crypto summits attracted OG ecosystem coders and builders, then Breakpoint \u2013 hosted by the Solana Foundation \u2013 capitalized heavily on investors.","Zaki Manian, a Cosmos partisan who nonetheless said he was short-term bullish on Solana, said the speculators vastly outnumbered the builders. \u201CThis is an event for people who are trying to figure out what has driven this massive price rise,\u201D he said.","Massive is an understatement. A $1,000 investment in SOL on Jan. 1 would have been worth over $172,000 on Nov. 6. The ecosystem has minted hordes of crypto rich in the COVID-19 era, and nowhere has this wealth accumulated faster than Solana\u2019s elite upper class. Venture firms bet big on Solana and won.","It was impossible to ignore their influence at Breakpoint. They moderated panels, joined project cap tables and rented out mansions, palaces and clubs. FTX, Multicoin, Solana Ventures, Jump Capital, Alameda and Race Capital studded the show.","These kinds of firms are the capitalist engines backing this $15 billion ecosystem\u2019s staggering growth. They\u2019re not like the VC firms of the tech and business world, one team told CoinDesk; they don\u2019t drain months on due diligence before signing checks.","And seldom do they sign actual checks. Stablecoins are crypto firms\u2019 currency of choice, and in Solana-land they\u2019re shelling them out fast. Projects can sometimes add a top name to their cap table in 10 Telegram messages or less, multiple sources said.","It certainly felt like money wasn\u2019t real. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian arrived in Lisbon planning to back a $50 million fund. By showtime, he and Solana Labs had doubled their ante to $100 million.","Read more: Reddit Co-Founder, Solana Ventures Launch $100M Initiative for Web 3 Social Media","An air of exclusivity pervaded the sold-out conference. Pricey $1,000 tickets gained entry to Breakpoint\u2019s main stage (in a converted warehouse with edgy vibes) a developer-focused outpost (in a swanky riverside restaurant) and Lisbon\u2019s botanical gardens. Tuk-tuks (auto-rickshaws) whisked attendees across town on demand.","While these excesses made Breakpoint feel at times more like a gilded retreat than a crypto convention, the on-stage content had real substance.","With 235 speakers, the myriad panels documented Solana\u2019s history and path forward. They often explored what makes Solana different.","There\u2019s plenty of material. For starters, Solana is not EVM-compatible, meaning projects deployed on DeFi market leader Ethereum cannot easily port over to it. This barrier may fall as one project is preparing a solution.","Read more: Neon Labs Raises $40M to Bring EVM Functionality to Solana","Solana also has heavy participation costs. Network validators must spend tens of thousands of dollars to keep their nodes relevant, an engineer at a validator firm told CoinDesk. A higher barrier to entry means fewer participants can afford to participate in Solana\u2019s most fundamental duty.","But Solana, which touts its minuscule transaction fees and super-fast settlement times, achieves those usability wins over Ethereum in part by taking a pragmatic approach to decentralization, a reality that was not lost on the panelists.","\u201CSometimes we may sacrifice some level of decentralization to improve the user experience,\u201D Andriy Velykyy of token bridging project Allbridge said on one panel. \u201CIn some cases when we add too much of the decentralization, that can impact users in a bad way. That\u2019s something we should think about as business owners.\u201D","Indeed, one of the main critiques levied at Solana is that it is not sufficiently decentralized.","Solana\u2019s Yakovenko framed the decentralization debate around network longevity. \u201CWhen [stuff] hits the fan, can you still recover and continue?\u201D Yes, he said, as long as one node survives with the network\u2019s history intact.","Crypto \u201Cdecentralization\u201D comes in many flavors. There\u2019s accessibility, governance, competition \u2013 all in addition to node count. Breakpoint highlighted just how many of Solana\u2019s successes came at the sacrifice of some of crypto\u2019s cultural mores.","For example, Serum, the liquidity protocol backed by FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried, is largely responsible for the proliferation of Solana-based decentralized exchanges. NFT protocol Metaplex has a firm grasp on the ecosystem\u2019s NFTs. Phantom, the super-popular wallet app developed by the eponymous company, is not open source.","\u201CSolana is so freaking competitive,\u201D Orca\u2019s Grace Kwan said during a panel on DeFi protocols where she argued against open sourcing too early. Doing so would be akin to showing the poker table her hand. Her fellow panelists agreed.","Little slips betrayed how invested the big players were in shaping the Solana ecosystem\u2019s image.","When a reporter met with a top Serum advisor for an informal interview, he was joined by two minders: one from Alameda Research, the other from Serum\u2019s public relations firm.","The thing is, Solana works. And it works well. And it works fast. That was more than enough for Breakpoint\u2019s chain-agnostic trading degens.","\u201CI\u2019m not a maximalist for decentralization; I don\u2019t give a s**t about it, to be honest,\u201D said Danny, a conference participant from the British Commonwealth who refused to provide his last name \u2013 for legal reasons.","Danny said he\u2019d been a crypto trader since 2016. He\u2019d flown in to see what this Solana thing was all about. To him, this chain was just another opportunity to make some cash. To his surprise, Danny was finding how many of his fellow trading mercenaries were cashing in here.","\u201CIt\u2019s been a real, real insight to see how many degens are getting jobs,\u201D he said, noting that he had no interest in going legit.","Breakpoint\u2019s gathering of paper-rich moonboys was the latest chapter in crypto\u2019s long history of throwing gilded conferences in faraway lands. This one traded garish wealth-signaling for accessible sophistication. Gone are the days where one parks a rented Lamborghini in Times Square to boast of heavy bags.","Still, the three-day conference\u2019s nonstop parties, flashing purple lights, sushi bars, bottomless buffets, swanky venues and rented rides felt somehow different.","As one Hong Kong-based trader put it at a mansion party across the bridge from Lisbon, \u201CDo we deserve all this wealth?\u201D","His shellshocked look toward a bevy of flashing lights left the question unanswered."],"entity":[{"type":"Commerce Square","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zaki Manian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$172,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Grace Kwan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"tens of thousands of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Alexis Ohanian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nov. 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Andriy Velykyy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana Labs COO Raj Gokal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana Ventures Launch","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Danny","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Multicoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jan. 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Allbridge","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Anatoly Yakovenko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lisbon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Solana Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"autumn","content":"DATE"},{"type":"19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.25 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana Breakpoint","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"late Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$100M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$15 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Serum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$40M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Times Square","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$50 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Solana","Events"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
