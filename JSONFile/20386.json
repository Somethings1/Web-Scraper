(Updated at 09:14 UTC: updates throughout the entire text.)","Bukele appears keen to expedite the process, details of which were only made public this past weekend at a Miami-based Bitcoin conference. He has already published the bill in the Official Gazette, which means the countdown to promulgation has already begun.","The bill (the full text (in English) of which can be found below) contains clauses that many traditional economists will likely find surprising, including the provision that \u201Cprices may be expressed in bitcoin.\u201D Citizens and residents will also be allowed to pay tax in BTC, while BTC transactions \u201Cwill not be subject to capital gains tax.\u201D However, for accounting purposes, the USD must be used as the official reference currency.","(Learn more: El Salvador Brings New Global Puzzle \u2013 What Is Bitcoin & How To Tax It?)","Bitcoin-related news stories dominated the country\u2019s media, with multiple front-page stories in leading newspapers such as ElSalvador.com (which publishes the top-selling print paper El Diario de Hoy).","Despite Bukele\u2019s zeal, it appears that not everyone in a position of power is quite ready for the BTC revolution yet.","ElSalvador.com quoted the head of the Central Reserve Bank, Douglas Rodríguez, as stating that bitcoin had displayed \u201Cquite high volatility,\u201D although he added that the USD itself was not immune to the same phenomenon.","He said:","\u201CBTC volatility does exist. There is quite high volatility, but that also happens even with the dollar. Even the best currencies experience volatility. [Prices] can go down or it can go up, they will not necessarily stagnate.\u201D","At 09:22 UTC, BTC trades at USD 34,292 and is up by almost 4% in a day, trimming its weekly losses to 6.5%. It\u2019s the best-performing cryptoasset today among the top 10 coins by market capitalization.","And the economist and former president of the Central Reserve Bank, Oscar Cabrera, was quoted elsewhere by the same outlet as stating that \u201Cwanting to adopt bitcoin as legal tender only generates uncertainty,\u201D since it is was \u201Cnot clear whether the measure \u201Cwill be supported by the Central Bank.\u201D","Cabrera added that the timing of the new law was also misjudged, as the country is currently \u201Cnegotiating a program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\u201D","He concluded:","\u201CCryptocurrencies have many risks and many of these are of a fraudulent nature. They are also very volatile and risky. And no financial regulator or prosecutor [fully understands] cryptocurrency.\u201D","Another leading economist said that crypto showed no evidence of retaining its value over time and bemoaned the fact that it cannot be policed by financial regulators.","Meanwhile, opposition MPs expressed concern, with the former presidential candidate Rodrigo Ávila of the ARENA party claimed that the government should \u201Clisten to cyber experts,\u201D as the new law specifies that any resident of the country who owns a computer or a telephone is obliged to accept bitcoin for any transaction.","Another opposition MP claimed that Congress should have been given more time to study the bill \u2013 especially considering the fact that accusations of money laundering-related issues have blighted crypto in the past \u2013 and the fact that no other country in the world has ever adopted a law of this sort.","But Bukele appears unconcerned with such matters \u2013 particularly as his Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas) Party recently won a landslide in congressional elections, making \u201Csupermajority\u201D votes relatively easy.","A number of Nuevas Ideas MPs spoke up in favor of the bill, with one claiming that money laundering concerns were much more pressing with cash than with crypto.","Bukele, meanwhile, appears set on courting the global crypto community \u2013 and wants to encourage businesses to set up shop in the country. He joined a live session on Twitter today, that was attended by more than 20,000 participants, including politicians, bankers, diplomats, investors, and others, to field questions about his new bill and policies. Asked if he thought other countries would follow his lead, he answered:","\u201CProbably it will create a domino effect. [\u2026] I know we\u2019re doing the right thing. [\u2026] We\u2019re going to see a lot of countries change because of [the bill] and it will likely be a better future.\u201D","(Learn more: More Latin American MPs Push for Bitcoin Laws \u2013 Including a Gov\u2019t Vice Minister)","The President\u2019s plan involves creating a trust at the Banco de Desarrollo de El Salvador (Bandesal) to allow for the \u201Cautomatic and instantaneous convertibility of bitcoin to USD necessary for the alternatives provided by the state.\u201D","ElSalvador.com wrote that Bandesal would, in effect, become a state-sanctioned \u201Cexchange house\u201D for BTC-USD transactions.","This trust will help the government, in the words of the bill, \u201Cprovide alternatives that allow the user to carry out transactions in bitcoin and have automatic and instant convertibility from bitcoin to USD if they wish.\u201D","The bill also commits the state to \u201Cpromoting the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.\u201D","He told attendees at the live session that although the state does not yet hold BTC, it is hoping to build up a store of USD 150m worth of BTC soon. At this stage, they\u2019re not considering adding BTC to the country\u2019s reserves, but, per the President, things are \u201Cevolving very fast\u201D now.","Perhaps the pick of his bullish remarks, however, was the President\u2019s claim that he wanted \u201Cto get people used to thinking in bitcoin units and less about dollars.\u201D","He added that citizens would be free to use wallets of their choosing, and would not seek to impose an official provider on the nation \u2013 although a government \u201Coption\u201D (developed by Lightning Network-powered BTC payments company Strike) would be made available.","The President said:","\u201CFinancial inclusion is going to need some government investment, so we\u2019re going to make that investment.\u201D","And Bukele also discussed the possibility of the state entering the BTC mining industry, stating that he had \u201Cnever thought of it,\u201D but conceded that \u201Cwe could do something to promote mining,\u201D particularly as his government has plans to better use clean, geothermal energy sources.","Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures who hosted the live session, drew a parallel to the ambitious but ultimately doomed Bretton Woods economic system, which collapsed in the early 1970s.","Elsewhere on Twitter, reaction has been plentiful and forthcoming, with prominent crypto investors and traders like @Iamnomad and @WhalePanda giving their takes on the developments.","The former noted:","\u201CA nation-state accepting [BTC] as legal tender, having laws countrywide mandated to support adoption and provide infrastructure for it is a gigantic step forward.\u201D","Meanwhile, the latter remarked (pertinently) that Bukele could soon have to defend his government\u2019s position to a very different crowd.","____","THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR","CONSIDERING:","THEREFORE, DECREES the following:","BITCOIN LAW","CHAPTER I\nGENERAL DISPOSITIONS","Art. 1.
