Currently, LUNC resides within a bullish reversal pattern known as a falling wedge. There is a good chance that we might see a strong breakout to the upside with enough accumulation around the lower price levels. ","The above price chart clearly reflects a bearish trajectory for LUNC over the last few days. We can see prior to the downtrend, LUNC was healthily bouncing off of the 20-day moving average and setting higher highs and higher lows. ","Now we are seeing the exact opposite occur where Terra Luna Classic is getting rejected at the 20-day moving average and at the upper resistance trendline of the falling wedge at $0.000593, $0.000509, $0.000394 and $0.000377.","Terra Luna Classic must now gain enough bullish momentum to break through the $0.000333 resistance level. Upon doing so, the technical target for LUNC is $0.00051 which would be a 61% increase from current price levels. ","Zooming into the 15-minute time frame for Terra Luna Classic we can see the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern.","Typically, this is a consolidative continuation pattern, on this particular occasion it would mean potentially dropping down to $0.00027 but I think the bulls may win the battle this time round. ","If LUNC breaks through the $0.0003 resistance trendline of the symmetrical triangle we should see a healthy continuation up to around $0.000319.","There has also been breaking news surrounding Terraform Labs stating that the South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for Terra Co-Founder Do Kwon himself. ","This has created seismic waves and a huge amount of FUD amongst LUNC and Terra Luna holders causing a deleterious effect on the price for both tokens (LUNC down 17.10%, LUNA down 24.63%).","A recent tweet from crypto analyst @ClassyCrypto_ states that he is speculating that this is merely a shakeout for retail investors as the huge amount of fear being driven from this controversial news is causing panic and as a result large selling pressure. ","NOTE : @stablekwon has NO affiliation with $LUNC at this point.\n\nI presume these are old coins ($LUNA 2.0 is crashing WAY harder.)","$0.00025 could be the bottom on this instance for LUNC, although September is known for being quite a rocky and bearish month for cryptocurrency. If Bitcoin can hold current price levels, I would hope to see LUNC slowly climb back up through to the $0.0003 price levels. ","It is safe to say that Terra Luna Classic has been one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies for 2022. ","Update \u2013 LUNC has recovered back above $0.0003.
