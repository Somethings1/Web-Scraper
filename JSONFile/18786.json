This update seeks to leverage Bitcoin\u2018s liquidity to enhance the stablecoin\u2019s existing framework.","The announcement suggested that following USDe\u2019s significant expansion since its inception, Ethena\u2019s hedges now account for approximately 20% of Ethereum\u2019s open interest.","\u201CWith $25bn of BTC open interest readily available for Ethena to delta hedge, the capacity for USDe to scale has increased >2.5x,\u201D said Ethena Labs.","\u201CIn just 1 year, BTC open interest on major exchanges (exc. CME) has grown from $10bn to $25bn, while ETH OI has grown from $5 to $10bn,\u201D said Ethena Labs.","The announcement also elaborated that Bitcoin derivative markets outpace Ethereum\u2018s in growth, providing enhanced scalability and liquidity for delta hedging.","BTC also provides a better liquidity and duration profile vs liquid staking tokens","As Ethene scales closer towards $10bn this provides a more robust backing, and ultimately a safer product for users","\u2014 Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) April 4, 2024","","\u201CAs Ethene scales closer towards $10bn this provides a more robust backing, and ultimately a safer product for users,\u201D the post reads.","Regarding the potential shortcomings of backing USDe with Bitcoin, the company stated that even if Bitcoin \u201Cdoes not possess a native staking yield like staked ETH, staking yields of 3-4% are less significant in a bull market when funding rates are >30%.\u201D","Therefore, according to Ethena Labs, the current market is \u201Cideal for optimizing for the scalability of USDe.\u201D","MakerDAO recently proposed to channel $600 million in DAI into the USDe and its staked variant, sUSDe, via Morpho Labs. his move aims to leverage Morpho Labs\u2019 lending capabilities, supporting the diversification of MakerDAO\u2019s investments.","According to MonetSupply from Block Analitica, the decision reflects user preferences for certain DeFi products and leverages, with a notable inclination towards USDe over sUSDe to reduce liquidity risks and augment Ethena\u2019s insurance fund.","The recommendation proposes a $600 million investment cap initially, with a potential increase to $1 billion."],"entity":[{"type":"$25bn","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"delta","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Morpho Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethena","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10bn","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 4, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$600 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$5","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Block Analitica","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethena Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ethena","USDe"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
