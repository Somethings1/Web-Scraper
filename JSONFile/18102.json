Howey, which defines any security as an investment contract. According to Embroker, a transaction is classified as an investment contract and passes the \u201CHowey test\u201D when it consists of an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profit derived from the investment of others.","\u201CIt\u2019s not we who are unwilling to faithfully apply the case law; it\u2019s the Commission,\u201D said a lawyer for Coinbase. \u201CThey are trying to stuff these transactions (into Howey) when they don\u2019t belong there.\u201D","Following over four hours of oral arguments, Judge Failla was unable to successfully make a decision on the case as of Wednesday afternoon.","\u201CI worry that I would be doing exactly the thing you\u2019re alleging the Commission is doing here, which is to take power that I don\u2019t have to stop activity I shouldn\u2019t be stopping,\u201D Judge Failla said.","\u201CThe answer may be that I\u2019m just out of luck until Congress acts,\u201D Judge Failla stated."],"entity":[{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Katherine Polk Failla","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1946","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Failla","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Supreme Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Embroker","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Howey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Manhattan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cynthia Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"afternoon","content":"TIME"},{"type":"June 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["SEC"],"authors":["Julia Smith"]}
