Much of the excitement occurred on its Twitter\/X-esque client Warpcast.","Frames enables users to take any post, aka \u2018Cast\u2019 in the protocol\u2019s terminology, and turn it into an interactive application, allowing them to superimpose polls, live feeds, mint NFTs, play games and perform many other interactions, according to Farcaster documents.","The feature taps the EdDSA authentication system. This is a cryptographic digital signature algorithm that eliminates \u201Cwallet drain risk,\u201D says Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero.","The launch and sudden spike in traffic was not without a hitch. On Sunday, Romero tweeted that there was \u201Cdegraded performance\u201D on the Warpcast application.","Two executive Coinbase alumni, former Vice President Dan Romero and ex-Senior Director Varul Srinivasan, co-founded Farcaster in 2020.","It\u2019s a decentralized protocol that powers a number of clients, including the microblogging app Warpcast, which is by far the most popular.","It accounts for 44.8% of Farcaster\u2019s current user base. Although people often confuse the two, Warpcast is a centralized protocol built on top of Farcaster. Recently, the latter was touted by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin for its security features.","The advantages of Farcaster\u2019s decentralized structure include user ownership over their data and censorship-free content.","The majority of Farcaster users link their Ethereum wallets to access the full suite of features across Farcaster\u2019s applications. However, basic in-app features don\u2019t require constant transactions.","One of the biggest divergences between Farcaster and its competitors is the concept of storage, according to X crypto guru Cygaar (@0xCygaar).","He explained in a thread on Sunday that to send posts and messages on Farcaster, users must rent storage space. While this may not sound appealing, the utility is to help reduce clutter like spam and bot activity.","Farcaster adoption has been skyrocketing lately, but many people still don't understand what it is.","Farcaster is not just a Twitter replacement \u2013 it's a whole decentralized protocol that can power a huge range of apps.","Here's a simple introduction to @farcaster_xyz ðŸ§µ: pic.twitter.com\/sAxGjGnrQr","\u2014 cygaar (@0xCygaar) February 4, 2024","",""],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 4, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dune Analytics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Romero","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Varul Srinivasan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"44.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Warpcast","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dan Romero","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["EdDSA","farcaster","warpcast"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
