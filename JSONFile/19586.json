Hong Kong, once a thriving hub for ICO listings, witnessed regulatory measures to delist many tokens.","While security token offerings (STOs), compliant ICOs that emerged later, failed to attract substantial investor interest in Asia, the industry landscape has since evolved. ","The JPEX scandal, regarded as potentially the largest financial fraud in Hong Kong\u2018s history, has prompted the Hong Kong government to expedite the approval process for cryptocurrency products to promote compliance in the industry.","According to OSL Compliance Exchange, a licensed virtual asset platform, financial technology solution providers have shown interest in the potential benefits of integrating tokenized platforms with banks in the future. ","This integration could leverage the public\u2019s trust in banks, thereby facilitating the growth of the virtual asset industry.","Back in June, Hong Kong implemented its new regulatory framework for crypto.","The new rulebook allows retail investors the ability to trade virtual assets, instead of restricting digital assets trading to professional investors and traders with at least $1 million in bankable assets.","As part of the new regulations, the SFC has also started providing licenses to crypto exchanges. ","OSL and Hashkey Group have become the first crypto exchanges in the city to receive licenses from the SFC. ","They also enjoy crypto-to-fiat conversion services from ZA Bank, the largest online-only bank in Hong Kong. ","The bank allows users of the trading platforms to withdraw crypto deposits in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and Chinese yuan. ","More recently, crypto exchange Hong Kong VAEXC (VAEX) applied for a virtual asset trading platform license with the SFC. "],"entity":[{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"25","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"OSL Compliance Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hashkey Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ZA Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wong Wai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Paul Chan Mo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hong Kong Securities & Futures Professionals Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Hong Kong","ICO"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
