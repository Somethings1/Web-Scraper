As there is no basis to assert any tax claim against the Debtors, the IRS\u2019s reliance on its own processes only serves to delay distributions to those truly injured.\u201D","Initially, the IRS alleged claims of $43 billion but revised it to $24 billion. ","FTX\u2019s debtors contested that the IRS failed to provide a basis for its claims, and the US previously stated that the IRS\u2019s claims \u201Care not subject to estimation.\u201D ","Consequently, the burden falls on the FTX debtors to disprove the claims, which could take several months to resolve.","\u201CThese cases should not be delayed by an IRS process that is akin to determining whether a shipwreck sits at 1,000 feet or 3,000 feet below sea level. The import is the same\u2014the ship is underwater,\u201D the lawyers further asserted.","Ernst & Young (EY) recorded FTX\u2019s loss at $11 billion, a figure reportedly reflected on the tax returns.","Although the FTX debtors have been cooperating with the IRS and providing requested documents, they argue that an additional lengthy fact discovery period is unnecessary since the IRS has been evaluating the tax issues for months.","Resolution of the IRS\u2019s claims is crucial for the progress of the bankruptcy proceedings. ","As per the proposed schedule, an evidentiary hearing is scheduled for confirmation in February of next year, allowing the parties to present their positions and provide briefing on the issues.","However, if the back-and-forth between the FTX debtors and the IRS continues, it could lead to a delay in the bankruptcy plan. ","The filing notes that the US provided an \u201Ceight-month estimation schedule\u201D for further IRS investigation.","FTX, which declared bankruptcy in November of the previous year, has been dealing with additional challenges as its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found guilty of fraud in November of this year. ","Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing hearing is also set for February 2024.","In late November, FTX received approval from a bankruptcy court to sell its stakes in digital trusts managed by Grayscale Investments.","The assets, valued at about $744 million last month, form a key component of FTX\u2019s plan to manage its bankruptcy.","Since filing for bankruptcy last year amidst fraud allegations, FTX has been on a mission to recover assets and address a complex network of debts.","This includes obligations to customers who invested cash and cryptocurrencies on the platform.","So far, FTX\u2019s administrators have successfully recovered around $7 billion in assets, including $3.4 billion in crypto, highlighting the scale and complexity of the company\u2019s financial entanglements."],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Internal Revenue Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the IRS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Grayscale Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$11 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$24 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ernst & Young (EY","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"IRS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$744 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$43 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3.4 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["FTX"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
