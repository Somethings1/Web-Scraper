This leap occurred in the wake of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and in anticipation of the expected halving event in April.","The recent climb marks a major milestone, as Bitcoin\u2019s market cap crossed the $1 trillion threshold for the first time since November 2021, according to Coin Market Cap.","So far, the token\u2019s price has increased by more than 20% in the last 30 days alone, while it\u2019s up by more than 133% YoY, trading at $51,816 at press time.","We are witnessing the start of an institutional #Bitcoin bull run!ðŸš€","\u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) February 14, 2024","","Part of this value boost likely stems from the SEC\u2019s recent nod to several spot Bitcoin ETF applicants.

It\u2019s an even bigger driver of Bitcoin price than the ETF,\u201D crypto analyst @beaniemaxi posted to X. \u201CBut now you got unprecedented demand coupled with an unprecedented supply cut. Miners are really the only economic sellers in this sort of market. And that\u2019s cut in half.\u201D","Ahead of the halving, Bitcoin miners are facing challenges, as recent findings indicate their earnings constituted a mere 10% of the daily inflow that spot Bitcoin ETFs secured earlier this week.","Anticipation of the halving could trigger another big rally for the cryptocurrency, mirroring the buildup to January\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF approval.","\u201CCurrently $45,900,000 worth of Bitcoin is mined every day,\u201D crypto YouTuber CryptoRover posted to X. \u201CAfter the halving (in 55 days) there will only be $22,950,000 produced every day.
