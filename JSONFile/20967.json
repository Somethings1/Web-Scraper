Grayscale\u2019s external representatives from Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP also attended the meeting.","On Nov.28, the SEC officials also met with BlackRock and the Nasdaq, as indicated by another memo. While the SEC\u2019s side was led by Eric Juzenas, the Associate Director in the SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets, BlackRock\u2019s Digital Assets Head Robert Mitchnick and Nasdaq\u2019s Principal Associate General Counsel Jonathan Cayne participated in the discussion, specifically about revising BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF model.","According to the published memo\u2019s note, BlackRock revised its In-Kind model design to address to the SEC\u2019s concerns and \u201Cunresolved\u201D questions regarding the model.","BlackRock\u2019s proposed \u201CIn-Kind\u201D redemption model involves market makers adjusting ETF shares supply and directly redeeming them for Bitcoin. This aims to closely link the share price with Bitcoin\u2019s value.","However, the SEC has concerns with this model, mainly because it requires U.S. broker-dealers to directly handle Bitcoin, posing potential risks to their investments. In response, the SEC suggested a \u201CCash\u201D model, which, though safer for broker-dealers, could make the fund\u2019s operation more complex and involve more steps for BlackRock.","\u201CThis [revised] model appears to address the Staff\u2019s concern with In-kind, addressing the critical dimension on which the In-kind model would otherwise be not preferred to the Cash model,\u201D said the note.","Bitcoin is currently trading at $38,223, almost 1% up from yesterday and 11% up from 30 days ago, according to CoinMarketCap. The SEC\u2019s pending approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs could potentially drive the Bitcoin price to skyrocket."],"entity":[{"type":"Nov. 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$38,223","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jonathan Cayne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"11%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"David Shillman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NYSE Arca, Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Robert Mitchnick","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eric Juzenas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Sonnenshein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nov.28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinMarketCap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin ETF","Blackrock","Grayscale","SEC"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
