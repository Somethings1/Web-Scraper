Clearly aware of his audience, Bukele took to Twitter to announce, in English:","\u201CThe bitcoin bill proposal that we\u2019ll send to Congress is almost ready. Simple. Short. Sweet.\u201D","Over the weekend, Bukele also edited his profile to feature red laser eyes \u2013 a commonly used sign of support used widely in the Twitter BTC and crypto community.","A similar tactic was employed by the Salvadorian President of the Legislative Assembly Ernesto Castro.","Another Bukele ally, the recently elected MP Dania GonzÃ¡lez, took a similar tack. All three are members of the populist Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas) party, which won a landslide majority in elections in the country back in March. GonzÃ¡lez sits on the parliament\u2019s finance committee.","But the trend appears to have spread like wildfire across the region. As previously reported, a Paraguayan MP named Carlos Rejala, from the relatively small but not insignificant opposition Hagamos Party, has also been vocal with his support for BTC adoption.","Rejala, aged 36, has been on a repost frenzy, as Bitcoiners champion his actions. He replied to the likes of the crypto investor Anthony Pompliano, writing in response to a call to \u201Cembrace bitcoin\u201D and \u201Cbring freedom to your citizens\u201D \u2013 \u201CI also believe this is the way!\u201D","Joining their number are the 36-year-old Brazilian MP FÃ¡bio Ostermann, from the minority Partido Novo. The MP edited his profile picture to add laser eyes and accompanied the post with the tags \u201CLaserEyes\u201D and \u201CLaserEyesTill100k\u201D and, in Spanish: \u201CNew Profile Picture.\u201D","Also in Brazil, Ostermann\u2019s fellow Partido Novo party member Gilson Marques (aged 40) went for the laser eyes look, and in response to a post on the matter from an English-language crypto-related account, replied that he was \u201Cgrateful for the reminder that I was the first MP to say \u2018tax is theft\u2019\u201D in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.","In Panama, the University of Oxford-educated, independent MP Gabriel Silva (aged 32) spared us the laser eyes, but instead reposted a Bukele, bitcoin-themed tweet, writing that he would also \u201Cbe preparing a proposal\u201D to put before the nation\u2019s parliament, adding: \u201CIf you are interested in creating it, you can contact me.\u201D","Silva added,","\u201CPanama cannot be left behind. If we want to be a true technology and entrepreneurship hub, we have to support cryptocurrencies.\u201D","And rounding out their number (thus far) is Francisco SÃ¡nchez (47), the Argentine MP for the NeuquÃ©n region. A member of the Juntos por el Cambio (Together for Change) opposition coalition, SÃ¡nchez also went with the \u201CNew Profile Picture\u201D hashtag and red laser eyes.","It may be worth noting, perhaps, that most of the MPs in question aside are younger, recently elected politicians from smaller, newer, and tech-keen parties. The exception, of course, is that in El Salvador, such a party has actually seized power.","Back in El Salvador, per El Mundo, the nation\u2019s Commerce and Investment Minister Miguel KattÃ¡n stated that the USD \u2013 the nation\u2019s current and only legal tender \u2013 \u201Cwill continue to be the legal tender in El Salvador.\u201D However, he added that \u201Ctransactions will be enabled in bitcoin,\u201D although he conceded that \u201Cobviously\u201D these would be \u201Crelated to [BTC\u2019s] value in dollars.\u201D","He added that the development \u201Cdoes not imply a de-dollarization of the Salvadorian economy.\u201D","The operator of the @HODLingOnward Twitter account, an \u201CAmateur Political Economist and Historian,\u201D offered some analysis on the situation in El Salvador, noting in a blog post that the nation\u2019s central bank and treasury\u2019s reaction would be of interest, and remarking:","\u201CWith bitcoin being made legal tender as well, merchants must accept payment in bitcoin if offered. This is a totally different paradigm than those on offer from the other nations that offer tax advantages to bitcoin holders.\u201D","And another more considered reaction came from Qiao Wang, Partner at DeFi Alliance, who wrote that although \u201Csome of\u201D the MPs\u2019 posts \u201Cmay be pure PR stunts,\u201D they may \u201Cexpand the Overton window.\u201D","He concluded,","\u201CThey make people think the unthinkable. Only then may the unthinkable be willed into reality.\u201D","At 08:49 UTC, BTC trades at USD 33,275 and is down by 8% in a day and 11% in a week.\n___","Members of the parliament of El Salvador!
