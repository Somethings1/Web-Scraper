Consensys denies that it acts as a broker, stating that the wallet is \u201Csimply and interface\u201D and \u201Cneither holds customers\u2019 digital assets nor carries out any transaction functions.\u201D","The complaint adds that the SEC\u2019s encroaching authority over Ethereum goes against its own past statements that the cryptocurrency is a commodity, not a security (citing former director Bill Hinman's 2018 speech), as well as the SEC\u2019s sister regulatory agency, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), own authority over Ethereum, which oversees derivative products tied to ether.","In its suit, Consensys claims that it \u201Cbuilt its business against the backdrop of this regulatory consensus\u201D, and the SEC\u2019s new grab for power \u2013 which it calls an \u201Cabout-face\u201D \u2013 over Ethereum would therefore \u201Cviolate the Constitutional requirement of fair notice under the Due Process Clause.\u201D","\"The SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys,\" the suit claims.","A representative for the SEC declined to comment on the suit.","The suit also leans on the \"major questions doctrine,\" a Supreme Court ruling barring federal regulators from dramatically exceeding the scope of their Congressional mandates. Two judges have already rejected the idea that crypto falls under the doctrine during arguments brought by Terraform Labs and Coinbase.","ConsenSys filed the suit in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas, joining groups like the Blockchain Association and companies like Legit Exchange, which filed similar preemptive suits seeking to block the SEC from treating certain crypto companies or assets as securities.","In recent months, the SEC has also brought suits against crypto exchanges like Binance.US, Binance and Kraken. Uniswap Labs revealed earlier this month it had also received a Wells Notice from the regulator.","UPDATE (April 25, 2024 at 19:41 UTC): Adds that the SEC declined to comment.","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"Blockchain Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 25, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wells Notice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Legit Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Supreme Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Northern District of Texas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bill Hinman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","SEC","Ethereum","ConsenSys","Securities"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon","Nikhilesh De"]}
