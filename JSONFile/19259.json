Compared, Visa processes 2,000 TPS, while Bitcoin (BTC) does 7 TPS.","However, developers did not provide any estimates when this solution might be implemented, only saying that \u201Cthe v0.1 devnet is the first step on the long journey\u201D and \u201Cit will take a lot of research, experimentation and development effort.\u201D","It seems that the market has decided to wait for the end of this journey \u2013 since December 5, ETH has been trading sideways, mostly moving together with the rest of the market.","At pixel time (18:05 UTC), ETH trades at c. USD 146 and is down by almost 2% in a day and a week, increasing its monthly losses to more than 23%.","ETH price chart:","However, on the bigger picture, bulls are in command as performance over the past year has been more impressive. After plunging to sub USD 100 levels at the depth of last year\u2019s crypto winter, ETH is up 59% in a year, despite the price dropped by almost 60% since June, when it surpassed USD 330.","Traders were hoping for ETH prices to snap back to 2017\u2019s bull trend given the optimism of Ethereum\u2019s developers and implementations of the Constantinople and Istanbul upgrades, on the way to Ethereum 2.0, which should make the network faster, particularly addressing the scaling and mining issues.",""],"entity":[{"type":"c.
