Kazakhstan, which offers industries relatively low-cost electricity access, also has cold winters \u2013 making it an ideal location for many miners.","This, along with a relatively pro-business approach to crypto mining regulation, has led to a growth in mining in the nation in recent years \u2013 with many bitcoin (BTC) miners relocating to Kazakhstan from China following last year\u2019s Beijing-led crypto crackdown.","But it appears that Tokayev is not content with simply allowing miners to set up shop in the country and taxing them on their income.","The President stated that the nation \u201Cmust make the most of\u201D its \u201Cpotential\u201D in the crypto sector.","He stated:","\u201COur country is the second largest producer of cryptocurrencies in the world. However, we should not just stick to the status quo, where we focus on [providing] raw [energy] materials. To this end, the government, together with financial regulators and the Astana International Financial Center, should create favorable conditions for the development of a comprehensive digital ecosystem.\u201D","A number of top-ranking domestic and international officials from the financial sector attended the summit. Representatives from both the private and public sectors were present.","Tokayev\u2019s comments come just a month after the President met with the CEO of the crypto exchange Binance Changpeng \u201CCZ\u201D Zhao in Nur-Sultan.","The duo spoke about \u201Cthe possibility of creating a regional hub for the crypto industry in Kazakhstan,\u201D Interfax reported.","Zhao signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations, and Aerospace, with Binance and the ministry pledging to support the growth of the Astana International Financial Center.","The parties also discussed \u201Cprospects for long-term cooperation\u201D in the \u201Cdigital finance\u201D sector and promised to launch \u201Cjoint educational programs\u201D to teach citizens more about blockchain technology.","Elsewhere in Central Asia, Uzbekistan has indicated that it too could seek to encourage miners to begin operating in the country \u2013 but only if they use green energy to do so. A recent governmental decree, authorized by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, indicated that the nation was ready to \u201Cdevelop the digital economy and the sector of the circulation of cryptoassets.\u201D","The government has announced measures that will see miners forced to use solar power \u2013 and make use of their own power-generating hardware.","Crypto mining, the government wrote, must only be carried out by \u201Clegal entities\u201D that make use of \u201Celectrical energy that is provided by a solar photovoltaic power plant.\u201D","In order to qualify as a \u201Clegal\u201D miner, companies must apply to become members of a national registry of approved crypto mining firms. Certificates of approval are valid one year after initial registration, after which they would need to be renewed. ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Miners on the Move: China\u2019s Crypto Mining Losses May Be Kazakhstan\u2019s Gain\n\u2013 Kazakhstan Develops New Program to Team Up Crypto Exchanges with Banks\n\n\u2013 Kazakhstan Central Bank Exploring \u2018Opportunities in Crypto, DeFi \u2018Innovation\u2019\n\u2013 Kazakhstan Mulls Higher Tax for Bitcoin Miners\n\n\u2013 Another Headache for Bitcoin Miners in Central Asia as Three Countries Hit With Blackouts\n\u2013 Uzbekistan to Throw its Doors Open to Tax-free Cryptocurrency Trading"],"entity":[{"type":"Beijing","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sultan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Astana International Financial Center","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tokayev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ministry of Digital Development","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Banks\n\n\u2013 Kazakhstan Central Bank Exploring","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Miners\n\n\u2013 Another Headache for Bitcoin Miners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kazakhstan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kassym","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jomart Tokayev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Central Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shavkat Mirziyoyev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Uzbekistan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Interfax","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Binance","Mining","Regulation","Tax"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
