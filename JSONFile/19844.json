It does not store user data or have access to user conversations.","Instead, user input is sent through an encrypted proxy server to a decentralized GPU, which runs the AI model and returns the answer.","This process ensures security and anonymity, as the GPU only sees the specific prompt and not the user\u2019s entire conversation.","Venice AI\u2019s model is designed to be substantially better than the current status quo, where centralized companies store and retain user conversations tied to their identities.","The AI industry\u2019s top players, such as Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Meta, have made efforts to improve the perception of generative AI by promoting responsible AI practices.","However, Voorhees argues that once a company has access to user information, it cannot be trusted to delete it permanently.","Venice AI addresses this concern by avoiding central repositories altogether. Chat history is stored locally in the user\u2019s browser and can be deleted at any time, even without creating an account.","While creating an account offers certain advantages, such as higher message limits and the ability to modify prompts, users can also access additional features by subscribing to a Venice Pro account.","Currently priced at $49 annually, Venice Pro provides unlimited text prompts, removes watermarks from generated images and document uploads, and allows users to turn off Safe Mode for unrestricted image generation.","Although Venice AI does not yet accept digital currencies for Venice Pro subscriptions, Voorhees confirmed that this feature is coming soon.","Fun with https:\/\/t.co\/m2jsJuDuXS","In Venice (with a Pro account), you can modify the \"System Prompt.\" This is basically like god mode or root access over the LLM with which you're interacting.","It can enable interesting perspectives that normal AI services would censor. pic.twitter.com\/qlt0xp0aC9","\u2014 Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) May 10, 2024","","In the meantime, users holding the Morpheus token will be rewarded with a free Pro account indefinitely.","The platform integrates with MetaMask wallets, offering users a seamless experience.","While Venice AI is built on the decentralized Morpheus network, Voorhees acknowledges concerns regarding its performance.","He noted that it is important that AI solutions are on par with centralized companies to ensure user adoption."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Voorhees","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Meta","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$49","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Erik Voorhees","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ShapeShift DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 10, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"GPU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Microsoft","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Venice","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"July 2021","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Artificial Intelligence"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
