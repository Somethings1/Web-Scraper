They\u2019d be \u201Cdeparting today\u201D with a minimum of 14 weeks of severance plus an additional 2 weeks for every year of employment beyond 1 year, 4 months of health insurance in the US, 4 months of mental health support, and access to Talent Hub to help them search for new employment.","Coinbase added in the SEC report that they expect the plan\u2019s \u201Cexecution\u201D to be \u201Csubstantially complete\u201D already in this second quarter \u2013 out of which only half of the month is left.","Therefore, the exchange estimates that it will incur some USD 40m-USD 45m in \u201Ctotal restructuring expenses,\u201D which they say are \u201Cfuture cash-based expenditures\u201D and are related to employee severance and other termination benefits.","Coinbase noted that they are not updating the outlook provided in a letter to its shareholders back in May, but that as a result of this plan,","\u201CThe Company expects that the previously provided outlook for the Company\u2019s technology and development and general and administrative expenses for full year 2022 to be closer to the lower end of the range included in the Shareholder Letter.\u201D","As reported in May, in reaction to the bearish market, the exchange has vowed to modify its earlier expansion plans for this year with regard to creating new jobs. Subsequently, some recruits voiced their disappointment over rescinded job offers.","Furthermore, Armstrong just recently responded to an online petition allegedly coming from one or more Coinbase workers calling out the management team for numerous mistakes and demanding exits of some of the executives. The CEO, however, urged the anonymous petitioners to \u201Cquit and find a company to work at that you believe in,\u201D and later added that \u201Cif you get caught you will be fired.\u201D","Meanwhile, crypto lender BlockFi CEO Zac Prince announced on Monday that \u201Cafter taking significant time to plan and consider, we are reducing our headcount by roughly 20%.\u201D","At the end of 2020, per the CEO, the company had about 150 employees and since then grew to over 850.","Having been affected by the changes in the macroeconomic conditions, the company had to make choices to manage costs, Prince said.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Layoffs at Crypto.com\n\u2013 Crypto Job Market: Cancelled Coinbase Recruits Get Emotional, Job Postings Down\n\n\u2013 \u2018Strongly Profitable\u2019 FTX Will Keep Hiring Despite Bearish Market \u2013 CEO\n\u2013 KuCoin, OKX Stick to Their Hiring Plans Despite Downturn as Coinbase Slows Down Hiring\n\n\u2013 Coinbase\u2019s Armstrong Reportedly Spends USD 133M On New LA Home, This Is How It Looks\n\u2013 Coinbase \u2018Frequently\u2019 Asks Employees to Rate Each Other \u2013 Report"],"entity":[{"type":"Coinbase Global, Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 14 this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Prince","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Zac Prince","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June 10, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"18%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June 30, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2013 KuCoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Armstrong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"second quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"fiscal quarter","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["BlockFi","Career","Coinbase","Exchange"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
