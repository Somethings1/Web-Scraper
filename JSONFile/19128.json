This report didn\u2019t explicitly say how much money was stolen, providing a contract explorer instead.","The 1inch exchange also put out a report, saying that, following a number of complex steps, \u201Cdue to STA token transfer fee implementation, the pool never received STA but released WETH regardless. The same step was repeated to drain WBTC, SNX and LINK token balances from the pool.\u201D All in all, they write, the attacker took out more than USD 500,000, transferring it to this address, which currently holds ETH 601 (c. USD 134,000).","If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because we saw similar attacks happening earlier this year. Back in February, tokenized margin trading and lending platform bZx suffered two attacks, which were defined as not an oracle attack, but \u201Ca clever arbitrage execution.\u201D","In April, another blow was delivered to the young industry of DeFi, when attackers exploited a known vulnerability in the callback mechanism of ERC777 (imBTC, an Ethereum token valued at 1:1 rate with bitcoin (BTC)), which allowed them to hijack a transaction and sell the same batch of tokens multiple times. The attacks at the time affected Uniswap and Lendf.Me.","Redditors argued that this Balancer attack was similar to the Lendf.Me hack \u201Cwhich used the ERC777 standard for copy\/pasted code which Compound designed only for ERC20 tokens because they knew it would leave ERC777 tokens vulnerable to hacks.\u201D Angel investor John Wineman was also among those who noticed this similarity.","Redditor \u2018Tricky_Troll\u2019 said that the fact that these are deflationary tokens is relevant as Balancer \u201Cwarned people not to create a pool with tokens that have a transaction fee or aren\u2019t of the ERC20 standard.\u201D","In their report, Balancer said that they \u201Cwere not aware this specific type of attack was possible,\u201D but that they \u201Cconsistently [\u2026] warned about the unintended effects ERC20s with transfer fees could have in the protocol,\u201D and that this is why STA was not included in the BAL mining whitelist. \u201CThe system is designed for compliant ERC20\u2019s and when tokens behave unintended ways, bad things can happen,\u201D they said.","Hex Capital argued that the vulnerability was known, saying that they submitted \u201Cthis exact attack vector to your bug bounty program on 5\/6 and was denied payment,\u201D adding: \u201CStatera Project pool was drained because Balancer Labs refused to acknowledge this critical vulnerability I alerted them about in MAY. This is a major issue in crypto today \u2013 creating bug bounty programs and then ignoring the results + refusing to pay out. We need to do better\u201D.","Balancer\u2019s Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Mike McDonald, wrote that the submitted report discussed \u201Ctrading a pool and slowly decreasing the pools balance vs internal balance which we were aware of and why warnings existed. Today worked because of flashlending. That is my fault and I apologize for not taking more time to review other consequences of what could happen.\u201D","1inch writes that \u201Cthe person behind this attack was very sophisticated smart contract engineer with extensive knowledge and understanding of the leading DeFi protocols\u201D, and that \u201Cthe attack was organized and well prepared in advance.\u201D","SetProtocol product marketing manager Anthony Sassano argued that, given that ETH mixer Tornado Cash was used to fund the first wallet, \u201CDeFi attackers are getting more sophisticated and creative.\u201D","Others wonder if there was some foul play involved. \u201CThat sounds really negligent, almost like it could have been on purpose,\u201D said \u2018rahul8658\u2019 on the Reddit thread. \u201CExit scam with plausible deniability?,\u201D asked \u2018Ethereum Customer Support\u2019 on Twitter.","Balancer has had a very turbulent week. It made a splash just days ago, immediately after it started distributing its new BAL token to users.","Soon after that, however, the team behind the new protocol had to intervene to stop the FTX exchange from continuing to exploit a weakness in the token distribution system.","Unlike what was seen following the second attack on bZx, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi did not sharply drop this time around, standing at USD 1.62 billion.","There has been a change in ranking, however, with Compound now taking the first spot, followed by Maker, and Synthetix, and Balancer dropping to the fourth place, having the TVL of USD 116.3 million. It dropped 142% in the last 24 hours, per Defi Pulse.","According to the token\u2019s contract address on Etherscan (at 8:50 UTC), BAL is trading at USD 11.5, nearly half the USD 20.5 reported five days ago.","We contacted Balancer Labs and will update should they reply."],"entity":[{"type":"John Wineman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"last 24 hours","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Synthetix","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Anthony Sassano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.62 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BAL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"8:50","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Statera Project","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"142%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Balancer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mike McDonald","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","DeFi","Hack","Security"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
