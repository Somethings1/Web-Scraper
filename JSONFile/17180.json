It also achieves encrypted aggregation of multi-domain identity data.","Per CARV,","\u201CThe result is an \u201Cidentity of identities\u201D that enables self-authentication, social overlapping, and commercial value generation from targeted user data.\u201D","Yu commented that \u201Cthis solution breaks down identity silos and rewrites the rules of data ownership.\u201D","The new standard, he said, enables a \u201Cnew era of data-to-earn\u201D in and beyond blockchain gaming. \u201CData self-sovereignty is now a reality across Ethereum and the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201D said Yu.","The standard offers three benefits:","Users can opt to share certain on-chain and off-chain identity information and then passively earn whenever brands leverage it.","CARV's not loud, but our impact is clearüåê","ERC-7231 is now an official standard, bringing every piece of your online self together, safely in your hands. ‚úãOwn your data, protect your privacy.","Join us in this silent revolutionüå±\nLearn more: https:\/\/t.co\/4lrWGscXw7#CARV\u2026","\u2014 CARV (@carv_official) February 22, 2024","","Moreover, CARV ID is integrated with the standard.","Per the announcement, more than 800,000 users are playing games and earning rewards across CARV\u2019s solution, which includes numerous layers, from foundational data stack to its gaming-focused application layer.","That said, ERC-7231 is \u201Cthe key to stringing everything together,\u201D it stated.","CARV has already seen great integration and use of the standard, said Yu for Cryptonews.","CARV ID, which follows ERC-7231, is adopted by more than 900,000 users globally across Southeast Asia, Japan, CIS, US, UK, and Latin America.","Daily active numbers are close to 500,000 across games and ecosystems.","Before this standard, Yu argued, understanding gamers has been difficult for games.","Users increasingly opt out of app tracking (IDFA), and shifting privacy regulations (CCPA) make data collection difficult.","With ERC7231, users can not only aggregate, own, and control their reputation, identities, and behavior across Web2 and Web3, but this quality zero- and first-party data can support games and artificial intelligence (AI) companies to create customized experiences.","","As for future plans, CARV aims to work with more Web2 and Web3 studios. The team wants to enable users to move across platforms interoperably.","On the tech side, \u201Cwe welcome all user identity solutions to adopt ERC-7231 and usher in a new age of identity-aggregated NFTs,\u201D said Yu.","ERC-404, launched shortly before ERC-7231, made quite an entrance in early February. It quickly became popular.","The ERC-404-based collection Pandora, though no longer in the first place, still ranks among the top 10 NFT collections per sales volume, per CryptoSlam.","Per¬†GitHub, ERC-404 is an experimental, mixed ERC20 \/ ERC721 implementation with native liquidity and fractionalization.¬†This means that it combines the ERC-20 (token standard) and ERC-720 (NFT standard).","Which ecosystem should we bring 404s to next?","\u2014 Pandora (@Pandora_ERC404) March 16, 2024","","Then in the second half of February, CARV launched ERC-7231.","\u201CFirst and most importantly, ERC-404 is an experimental standard yet to be formally proposed for inclusion in Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs),\u201D Yu told Cryptonews. ERC-7231, on the other hand, is a fully finalized and approved ERC standard.","However, per Yu,","\u201CIt must be said that 7231 and 404 both move the needle toward democratizing asset ownership and the share of value creation \u2013 this is a good thing. However, each standard works in a different way.\u201D","ERC-404 is a semi-fungible token that allows multiple wallets to own an NFT. But ERC-7231 binds multiple Web2 and Web3 identities to a single NFT holder.","Via this holder NFT, users can standardize their identities, modify the NFT based on behavior (data aggregation), and share in value generation from user targeting whenever brands leverage it on-chain and off-chain.","\u201CThe result is an \u201Cidentity of identities\u201D that achieves encrypted aggregation of multi-domain identity data, offering something for both games and gamers. A data win-win,\u201D said Yu.","CARV is starting with gaming but there are many ways this technology can be used.","\u201CImagine AI-based healthcare solutions making earth-shattering breakthroughs with the help of access to clean and encrypted data from users, and then rewarding these users with the monetary value such breakthroughs are creating, enabled by smart contracts,\u201D Yu concluded.","Notably, in mid-February, a different team of developers announced the launch of¬†the \u2018Divisible NFT\u2019 standard (DN404), calling it \u201Ca hybrid ERC20\/721 token.","This team\u2019s approach was to have two contracts: a \u201Cbase\u201D ERC-20 with a \u201Cmirror\u201D ERC-721.
