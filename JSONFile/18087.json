The venue for this event, held after the Digital Assets Summit 2024, was the 5-star Mandrake Hotel in London\u2019s Fitzrovia.","Per an image the FT obtained, a red-lacquered dining room reportedly featured two individuals in minimal attire positioned on a long table, with sushi served directly on their bodies.","The outlet said that the after-party invitation promised a multi-sensory experience: \u201CAttendees will be able to entertain and explore all five senses.\u201D","Copper didn\u2019t return Cryptonews\u2019 request for comment by press time.","A senior Copper employee told the FT that having scantily clad people was not the typical party set-up. They added that: \u201CCrypto is getting a lot more civilized, so that\u2019s not really the style.\u201D","Copper specializes in digital asset custody and trading services tailored to institutional investors. Its offerings include a scalable settlement network, custody-integrated staking, and automated wallet services.","Notably, in 2023, the company appointed former UK Chancellor Philip Hammond as its chairman. He was reportedly not in attendance at the controversial event.","Facing challenges in obtaining approval from the UK\u2019s financial regulatory authority, Copper withdrew its application to operate in the country in 2022. Instead, it shifted focus towardÂ securing registration in Switzerland.","An insider close to the company described the situation as more akin to flamboyant performance art than anything salacious. They also revealed that the models were a man and woman, clad in swimwear.","The practice of serving sushi off semi-clad bodies, known as nyotaimori, has gained attention in Western countries as an exotic cultural experience inspired by Japanese traditions. This tradition, although available in certain Western locations, remains on the fringes, even within Japan\u2019s expansive erotic entertainment industry.","Despite its occasional portrayal in media and popular culture, nyotaimori dinners are not widely adopted. They are also not considered a commonplace practice, either in Japan or Western societies.","The FT highlighted concerns around a prevalent culture of \u201Ccrypto bros,\u201D characterized by male dominance in major companies, as a persistent issue. This culture has been linked to governance failures, exemplified by the collapse of exchanges like FTX.","Hosting a Nyotaimori dinner, which is seen as potentially objectifying, may be viewed as perpetuating this problematic culture and further highlighting governance shortcomings within the industry."],"entity":[{"type":"nyotaimori","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"London\u2019s Fitzrovia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mandrake Hotel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Philip Hammond","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nyotaimori","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Copper","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Custody","UK"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
