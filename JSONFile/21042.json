Companies with an annual revenue of $220,000 to $330,000 will have an additional year to adopt.","However, smaller firms may be exempt from the new rules. The media outlet noted that companies with an annual revenue of under $55,000 will not be obliged to accept CBDC payments at all.","The bank and the Kremlin have prior form. They used a \u201Csimilar approach\u201D to the Mir payments system, which debuted in 2017.","The amendment will also be bundled with provisions for the Faster Payments System (SBP), another Central Bank project.","In the bank\u2019s own words, SBP \u201Callows individuals to instantly transfer funds to each other using mobile phone numbers, pay for purchases, pay utility bills, and make a wide variety of other transfers.\u201D","Larger firms will need to adopt SBP pay by October 1 this year. Medium-sized companies will be given until October 1, 2025.","Interfax reported that it had seen an accompanying note from the Central Bank that read:","\u201CThis bill provides for a staged approach. It will provide merchants with the ability to make payments using SBP and digital rubles. And it will let merchants prepare for the implementation of the requirements of the bill.\u201D","The bank further enthused:","\u201CWe took a similar approach to introduce the mandatory acceptance of Mir payment cards and this proved effective.\u201D","The amended bill is yet to pass before lawmakers, but the idea that CBDC acceptance \u201Cmay become mandatory\u201D is a major departure for the Central Bank.","The bank has previously insisted that individuals will be free to choose whether or not they want to use the digital ruble.","Russia\u2019s growing trade with China has helped its economy withstand Western sanctions.
