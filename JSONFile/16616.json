{"summary":"Robinhood apparently made strenuous efforts to comply with the agency, even applying to become a special purpose crypto broker-dealer. The SEC is likely to sue for alleged securities violations in any case.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/consensus-magazine\/2024\/05\/06\/the-sec-cant-stop-suing-crypto-companies\/","publishDate":"2024-05-06T19:27:32","id":16616,"type":null,"title":"The SEC Can\u2019t Stop Suing Crypto Companies","category":["Consensus Magazine"],"content":["Robinhood is the latest firm to draw the ire of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This weekend, it reported receiving a Wells notice \u2013 an announcement that the securities watchdog is building a case and intends to sue. In an 8-K filing, the fintech firm revealed it received the letter from the SEC\u2019s enforcement division for alleged securities violations.","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","At this point, it\u2019s hard to be surprised by the SEC\u2019s anti-crypto actions \u2013 shameless though they may be. Apparently, the agency sent the notice after Robinhood cooperated with the SEC\u2019s investigative subpoenas about its crypto operations. A Wells notice is essentially the last chance the accused has to convince regulators that it didn\u2019t break the law, which would be a sign of good faith except that the vast majority of these letters end up in a lawsuit.","As Robinhood legal, compliance, and corporate lead Dan Gallagher noted in a statement, the firm has been in direct communication with the SEC over its crypto offerings for years, which is exactly what you\u2019d expect from a firm that really only dabbles in crypto. It\u2019s not clear from the letter which tokens are considered securities by the SEC, though it\u2019s worth noting the brokerage proactively delisted a number of tokens \u2014 including Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA) \u2014 in response to previous SEC lawsuits against rival trading firms.","\u201CWe firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to make clear just how weak any case against Robinhood Crypto would be on both the facts and the law,\u201D Gallagher said. He noted in particular the firm\u2019s \u201Cyears of good faith attempts to work with the SEC for regulatory clarity\u201D and, like other crypto firms in legal limbo, \u201Cwell-known attempt to \u2018come in and register.\u2019\u201D","Further, in heeding \u201Cthe SEC\u2019s calls,\u201D Robinhood attempted to register as a special purpose broker-dealer with the agency. While there are many licensed crypto firms, so far Prometheum Ember Capital, a trading company that doesn\u2019t yet offer any assets to trade, is essentially alone in receiving a special purpose broker-dealer license, which were introduced in 2020 to allow firms to custody and transact in \u201Ccrypto asset securities.\u201D","While just speculation, I have a sense the SEC started to build a case right around the time Gallagher, himself a former SEC commissioner and securities law expert, testified before Congress that the SPBD process is irrevocably broken and a profound waste of resources. To wit:","\u201CWhen Chair Gensler at the SEC in 2021 said, \u2018Come in and register,\u2019 we did,\u201D Gallagher said in a June 2023 House Agriculture Committee crypto hearing. \u201CWe went through a 16-month process with the SEC staff trying to register [as] a special purpose broker-dealer. And then we were pretty summarily told in March that that process was over and we would not see any fruits of that effort.\u201D","So, to sum up, the SEC announced intentions to sue a firm for failing to register for a license after seemingly denying the firm that very license (though to be accurate, the SPBD licenses are given out by self-regulatory organization FINRA).","This fits with a long pattern. Since coming into office in 2021, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made it his business to rein in the crypto industry, which he says is under his remit (an arguable contention). These efforts dramatically increased in the wake of the collapse of FTX, which was particularly embarrassing for U.S. regulators given how cozy Sam Bankman-Fried was with them.","The SEC now spends a disproportionate amount of time and money pursuing legal challenges against crypto firms both large and small. The agency has filed at least one lawsuit per month since last November against a crypto company, the majority of which go unnoticed and typically end in a settlement.","\u201CThe SEC just sent a Wells notice to Robinhood. The number they've sent about crypto in recent months is astonishing. It's hard to imagine that they would (or could) bring so many enforcement actions at once,\u201D Variant Fund legal lead Jake Chervinsky said on X. \u201CIt seems like they're abusing the Wells process as a scare tactic now.\u201D","See also: Consensys, a Target for the SEC's Assault on ETH, Is Fighting Back | Opinion","In some sense, these lawsuits \u2014 particularly the ones brought against big name firms like Coinbase and Robinhood \u2014 are an attempt to signal that crypto is essentially lawless. This is not squarely the fault of the SEC, but also that Congress slept on crypto regulation for over a decade and is now hampered by partisan gridlock.","\u201CI don\u2019t know why [the SEC] did what they did. But there\u2019s no going back on rules now,\u201D Beau J. Baumann, a PhD. candidate at Yale Law School, and co-author of an influential crypto law paper, told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201CIn that sense, the whole thing is bad faith. If the enforcement actions are unlawful, writing a rule is way more obviously so.\u201D","\u201CCongress should enact new legislation to avoid legal pitfalls, but it\u2019s unclear to me whether they actually will,\u201D Baumann added. Gensler, for his part, has stated directly that he doesn\u2019t think crypto needs bespoke legislation or guidance, given his view that everything crypto, bar bitcoin, walks and talks like securities.","While the SEC has had legal victories, it\u2019s suffered many court losses as well. It remains to be seen whether Robinhood will actually get sued, and if so whether it goes the way of Coinbase and Consensys and mounts its own offensive legal campaign.","If there is a silver lining here, it\u2019s that, after years of trying to eat the entire crypto pie, Gensler\u2019s SEC may have bitten off more than it could chew. Robinhood\u2019s stock dipped in pre-market trading today, but has since bounced back, an indication in part that the market doesn\u2019t take this action seriously, at least materially-speaking.","Afterall, even if the SEC wins, it\u2019s hard to imagine the tangible benefits of preventing people from trading Stellar lumens (XLM) or dogecoin (DOGE)."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jake Chervinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Beau J.
