Among those who do work with crypto, advisors typically allocate only 1% or less of the client\u2019s capital to crypto, the report said.","Commenting on the findings, James Seyffart, ETF Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said regulations are still holding back traditional investors in the US from moving into digital assets.","\u201CIn the US, regulatory concern is the top reason advisors haven\u2019t invested in cryptoassets. We believe a Bitcoin ETF approval would alleviate these concerns,\u201D Seyffart said.","He added that the number of publicly listed crypto funds globally \u201Cshould sustain the rapid growth of the past two years through 2022 and into 2023\u201D as more countries allow for spot-based crypto funds to be listed.","Meanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence also predicted that the crypto industry is moving from having a \u201Cniche offering\u201D to becoming a more established investment product. In line with this, exchanges such as Coinbase and FTX are likely to see strong volume and revenue growth, the report said.","Lastly, the report argued that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the US, typically referred to as a \u2018digital dollar\u2019, is \u201Ca distinct possibility,\u201D although nothing has so far been confirmed on that front.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Grayscale Would Consider APA Lawsuit if SEC Rejects its Bitcoin ETF Conversion Application, Says CEO\n\u2013 MicroStrategy\u2019s and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s Shares Now Compete with ETFs\n\n\u2013 Once the Fed Pauses, Bitcoin is \u2018Going to the Moon,\u2019 Novogratz Says \n\n\u2013 Bitcoin ETFs Remain Popular Among Investors Despite Price Slump\n\u2013 Crypto Bottom is In and \u2018Massive Rally\u2019 Awaits, Pantera Capital Predicts"],"entity":[{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2028","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2018Massive Rally\u2019","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Would Consider APA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"past two years through 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pantera Capital Predicts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Fed Pauses","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Novogratz Says \n\n\u2013 Bitcoin ETFs Remain Popular Among Investors Despite Price Slump\n\u2013 Crypto Bottom","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","CBDC","Cryptocurrency","ETF","Exchange","Forecast","Investing","Regulation","USA"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
