That\u2019s why many crypto veterans have recently turned their attention to an under-the-radar AI crypto startup called yPredict.","While still relatively unknown to the general public, yPredict has caught the eye of industry experts who are steadily accumulating the project\u2019s native token ahead of its upcoming launch. But what exactly does yPredict offer and why are crypto gurus making moves to invest now?","üöÄ Ready to boost your crypto portfolio? üìà Check out yPredict, the altcoin with the potential for 20x gains! üí∞","üî• Earn up to 45% quarterly rewards with yPredict's staking platform.\nüõçÔ∏è Get discounts on yPredict features and lifetime access to prediction tools.\nüìä A one-stop\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/rrwDnDUw9d","\u2014 yPredict.ai (@yPredict_ai) November 9, 2023","","yPredict seeks to be a gateway to advanced AI crypto analytics powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. At its core is the ERC-20 utility token, $YPRED, which provides access to the platform\u2019s paid services.","Despite its low mainstream visibility up to this point, yPredict is generating a swell of interest within crypto trading communities by unveiling the pilot versions of its AI cryptocurrency scanning and tracking tools this year.","The AI crypto startup also opened up an AI-powered backlink estimator tool to the public for a limited time, receiving over 5,000 requests in 24 hours.","This demand even after a preview of yPredict\u2019s AI crypto offerings has industry leaders taking notice and acquiring the $YPRED token through the ongoing public presale.","Visit yPredict Now","Industry experts likely recognize the potential in yPredict\u2019s suite of AI crypto and machine learning technologies.","The project\u2019s whitepaper states that yPredict utilizes data analytics abilities exceeding human limitations to identify trends, patterns, and key understandings for cryptocurrency trading.","For instance, yPredict\u2019s core AI crypto platform intends to provide trading signals, price predictions, sentiment analysis, pattern recognition, and other tools to give users an advantage in the volatile crypto space. The AI crypto startup has begun rolling out access to these features through a waitlist.","Additionally, yPredict launched a model called Alt_Pump_001, designed to detect overlooked altcoins positioned for exponential growth. Usually carrying a monthly subscription cost of over $1000, the model is free for presale buyers who purchase a minimum of $500 in $YPRED tokens.","The AI crypto platform also offers unlimited access to its backlink estimator tool as part of its presale perks. This tool seeks to optimize search engine optimization (SEO) strategies by determining the ideal backlink profile to rank target keywords.","Given the immense value of these AI crypto capabilities for crypto projects, investors are eager to gain access by buying $YPRED.","\u201CI\u2019m bullish on yPredict due to its fair token distribution and allocation,\u201D said crypto analyst and YouTuber Michael Wrubel. Other experts likely hold similar sentiments as they acquire $YPRED before it becomes mainstream.","As insider interest in yPredict continues mounting, so too does demand for the platform\u2019s native $YPRED token via the ongoing public presale. yPredict has raised over $4.8 million and counting as stakeholders eagerly acquire $YPRED ahead of the full launch.","Yet this surge of activity suggests that the window of opportunity is beginning to close. With 80% of the total token supply allocated to the presale, the inventory available at exclusive presale rates is limited. Once the allotment sells out, exchanges will list $YPRED at higher market prices post-launch.","üöÄ Explore the future of crypto trading with #YPredict! ü§ñ","Harnessing AI and ML, we empower traders with data-driven insights for smarter decisions and bigger profits.

As one of the perks of participating in the presale, early buyers will also gain privileged access to yPredict\u2019s AI-powered crypto utilities before the public launch.","However, these benefits will not last indefinitely. As the presale progresses, the remaining token supply diminishes by the day. The current presale period could conclude very soon given the accelerating demand.","Visit yPredict Now","Disclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.
