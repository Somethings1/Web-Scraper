Some 80% of the inflows happened after the Shanghai upgrade went live on April 12, he added.","Ethereum\u2019s highly anticipated tech update, often referred to as the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade, starting April 12 enabled withdrawals of some 18 million tokens, worth $35 billion, previously locked up in staking contracts. After the upgrade, ETH\u2019s price rallied to $2,100, its highest level in 11 months, defying earlier concerns the unlocking could lead to significant selling pressure and a price crash. The token recently has dropped below $1,900, aligning with a broader crypto market decline.","Allowing withdrawals also reduced the liquidity risk associated with locking up ETH for staking, which has kept some investors at bay before. \u201CWe expect this to naturally increase staking rates after the initial drawdown of ETH from long-term validators,\u201D Milanovic said.","According to a survey by Kiln, an institutional-grade staking service provider, 68% of investors said they intend to start staking or increase their staked amount after Shanghai. The survey was conducted in February, before the Shanghai upgrade.","Thomas de Phuoc, Kiln\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer, said the firm experienced a fresh wave of interest in staking, even from traditional finance (TradFi) firms.","\u201COur sales team noted 60% more deals in the pipeline than at the same time last year, including from traditional institutions,\u201D Phuoc said. \u201CWe are discussing at the moment with some brokerage firms, investment banking services holding companies in the U.S. or in Europe.\u201D","Kiln has recorded $47 million (24,640 ETH) of new deposits since the Shanghai upgrade, according to a Dune dashboard by crypto venture fund Dragonfly\u2019s analyst.","Rival platform Staked.us booked $111 million (58,592 ETH) in inflows, more than double the $51 million (26,667 ETH) of staking rewards withdrawn, per Dune data.","Still, it is early to draw definite conclusions, Milanovic noted, because not all staking providers have enabled withdrawals immediately.","Edited by James Rubin."],"entity":[{"type":"Dune","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1,900","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michiel Milanovic","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Phuoc","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Phuoc","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$111 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2,100","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"James Rubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"68%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$51 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$35 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$47 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Milanovic","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the U.S.","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Staking","Ethereum 2.0","Shanghai upgrade","Institutional Investment","Institutional Investors","ConsenSys","Kiln","Staked eth","Markets","Investing"],"authors":["Krisztian Sandor"]}
