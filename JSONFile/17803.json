Bitcoin miners Hut 8 and Hive have also announced pivots to AI, and they also witnessed a sharp surge in their stock prices. ","Hut 8 Mining Corp.\u2019s new high-performance computing division generated $4.5 million of monthly recurring revenue in Q1 2023, contributing more than 20% of the crypto miner\u2019s first-quarter sales. \n ","Iris Energy isn\u2019t the first one to announce an expansion to serve AI Cloud services. When Ethereum shifted from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, most Ethereum miners made similar changes.","As Proof of Stake does not require large amounts of computing power and data centers, Ethereum miners started looking for other options, including AI applications and cloud computing. ","Canadian crypto miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE) announced its plans to launch \u2018HIVE Performance Cloud\u2019 later this year. The crypto miner also revealed that it is currently running a pilot project at a Tier 3 data center for cloud computing utilizing Nvidia GPUs. ","Nvidia also became a trillion-dollar company this year after it revealed high-end graphics cards for AI and virtual reality. "],"entity":[{"type":"2028","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"21%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nvidia","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Artificial Intelligence (","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dell Technologies\u2019 HPC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Proof of Work to Proof of Stake","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"63%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"8 Mining Corp.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4.14","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3.55","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$76 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"s1","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Iris Energy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dell Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Q1 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Mining","Crypto Mining"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
