It is not clear how far they\u2019ve got in actually developing this solution.","Per its website, JPMorgan said that,","\u201CWeb3 demands a new way for us to interact with digital assets, protect our identities and access the Web3 economy.\u201D","JPMorgan operates its enterprise blockchain Liink under a separate arm of the company known as Onyx. Liink, a centralized and permissioned type of blockchain meant for internal use, is described by JPMorgan as an \u201Con-chain commercial bank payments solution.\u201D","Onyx said in a video that it is working on transforming \u201Cthe future of digital identity and digital assets,\u201D where it would enable users to,","\u201CControl your digital identity and all your digital assets using one digital wallet.\u201D","The company, said the video, is exploring a digital future where users would be able to store, view, and share digital assets that are bound to their digital identity, all in one place.","Onyx argued that ownership and taking control of one\u2019s digital identity are key in the transformation of online interactions that we are currently witnessing. It involves not only communication, but self-expression, as well as authentication of one\u2019s identity, digital goods, valuables, and even memories.","Given that digital assets are increasingly more portable, and ownership more prevalent, a digital identity is necessary for a person to control their identity credentials \u2013 to prove one\u2019s identity, and to do so by sharing only the information a person wants to share, argued Onyx.","With the company\u2019s potential new solution, users would be able to choose the identity credentials they want to share in their online interactions, across Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the metaverse, and \u201Cbeyond.\u201D","The company\u2019s video argued that it would be possible to protect one\u2019s identity by, for example, using only the credit score for buy-now, pay-later options, and not revealing all personal information.","It will also be possible to prove ownership of non-fungible tokens (NFT) across different platforms.","The product would also enable content creators to move platforms and bring their community along.","Onyx stated in the video that the product is currently in development, but also added in a disclaimer that,","\u201CThe solution discussed herein is a proof of concept and not a live product. There is no guarantee that JPMorgan will offer the solution.\u201D","Meanwhile, in September, JPMorgan announced that it was looking for a Web3 expert. They searched for a business development manager who would join the Technology, Media, and Telecom West Coast Team with a focus on companies in North America.","Just days ago, the bank hired Aaron Iovine, a former executive at bankrupt crypto lender Celsius.","JPMorgan had launched a centralized digital token known as JPM Coin in 2019.","Watch the full video here:","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 10 Traditional Companies that are Moving into Crypto Despite Market Downturn\n\u2013 Banks Exploring Blockchain, Tokenization Again is a \u2018Fire Signal We\u2019re in a Bear Market\u2019\n\n\u2013 Here is JPMorgan\u2019s \u2018Metaverse Strategy\u2019 Advice for Businesses\n\u2013 Bitcoin Undervalued, Crypto Now Better Than Real Estate \u2013 JPMorgan"],"entity":[{"type":"Onyx","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"JPM Coin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Telecom West Coast Team","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"North America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aaron Iovine","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tokenization Again","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","DeFi","JPMorgan","Metaverse","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Web3"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
