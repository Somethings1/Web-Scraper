Milei sees Bitcoin as a pivotal movement, advocating for the return of money to the private sector.","Despite Milei\u2019s pro-Bitcoin stance, there is no indication that he plans to make Bitcoin legal tender in Argentina. Milei prepares to assume office on December 10.","In contrast, defeated opponent Sergio Massa, the current minister of economy, has opposing views on the financial landscape. Massa had pledged in October to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a solution to Argentina\u2019s enduring inflation crisis, showcasing a divergence in perspectives within the country\u2019s political landscape.","While Massa secured the first round of the presidential election in October, it was insufficient to secure the presidency outright, leading to the final run-off vote that culminated in Milei\u2019s triumph. Milei had previously emerged victorious in Argentina\u2019s primary election against other prominent candidates in August, setting the stage for his successful presidential bid."],"entity":[{"type":"November 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"December 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sergio Massa","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Milei","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Milei","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"55%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$37,229","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Argentina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"140%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Javier Milei","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Massa","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Argentina","Bitcoin"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
