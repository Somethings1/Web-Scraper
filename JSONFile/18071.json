It appreciated 25.9% in a week, 22.5% in two weeks, 48.6% over the past 30 days, and 43.4% in a year.","As the coin is now valued at $0.63, the question looms: is there any more potential for growth? And can The Sandbox hit $1 any time soon, or even more \u2013 break its all-time high of $8.4?","The daily chart shows that the coin is still well within its channel, which could put it in single-digit territory as soon as early February next year.","However, keep in mind that the token has come dangerously close to the channel\u2019s upper border, which could serve as a local top.","Be wary of the $0.7-$0.8 range by the end of the year and in early January. Not only is this range the channel\u2019s top border, but it also served as a support\/resistance on numerous occasions.","Should it drop, keep an eye on the $0.5 level, as that\u2019s the channel\u2019s bottom. A bounce from that level would signal significant strength.","Breaking the $0.7-$0.8 range, SAND\u2019s next stop would be the $1-$1.2 range, which was also an important milestone during the bear market depression.","After that, important psychological levels include $2.5 and $5.","Dreaming of a White Christmas? ☃️ Immerse yourself in the festive spirit at the gorgeous @Charles_Keith ski resort.
