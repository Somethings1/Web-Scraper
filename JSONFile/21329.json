Public data shows that the nation is currently $34.7 trillion in debt, and is making annual interest payments of over $1 trillion.","fmr speaker Paul Ryan's comments on stablecoins on bloomberg last friday. extremely important for a few reasons: pic.twitter.com\/k2fdodTUvJ","\u2014 nic carter (@nic__carter) May 15, 2024","","\u201CI think stablecoin legislation would be a step in the right direction,\u201D he said. \u201CThat could be done this year, but I don\u2019t see anything other than that on the horizon.\u201D","Stablecoins are crypto tokens that are pegged to relatively value-stable assets \u2013 mainly the U.S. dollar. Crypto traders often use them for trading, borrowing, and lending in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, while others use them to access the stability of the dollar in countries where dollars are otherwise unobtainable.","Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle mainly back their tokens with short-term US Treasury bills and other dollar equivalent instruments, while profiting on the interest they provide. As such, rising demand for stablecoins directly translates to demand for US government debt, which is imperative when the government needs lenders.","At present, the stablecoin market is over $140 billion in size, but remains unregulated. According to Ryan, a bipartisan agreement on stablecoins making its way through the legislative process could help remedy that, currently being negotiated between Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters of the House Financial Services Committee.","\u201CI think there\u2019s a reasonable chance they could get a deal on stablecoin legislation,\u201D Ryan said. \u201CThat means you have a legal framework in which you can have stablecoins deployed\u2026 you\u2019d go from a couple hundred billion dollars of stablecoins to maybe trillions.\u201D","The former speaker said that stablecoins adoption could integrate the dollar into the ongoing digitization of currencies, and entrench dollar adoption overall.","\u201CThat\u2019s one thing you can try and do on the margins to improve demand for bonds and improve dollar adoption,\u201D he concluded.","Ryan\u2019s comments echo a common pro-crypto sentiment among Republicans, who have taken up the mantle of supporting the industry in place of their less-than-favorable Democrat counterparts.","Former president Donald Trump, who once blasted Bitcoin as a scam, has recently flipped positions with a promise to keep crypto in America."],"entity":[{"type":"$34.7 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ryan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Maxine Waters of the House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paul Ryan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Patrick McHenry","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States House of Representatives \u2013","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paul Ryan \u2013","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$140 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"hundred billion dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Congress","Stablecoins"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
