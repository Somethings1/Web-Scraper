This came with massive adoption, growing to over 8 billion dollars in total value locked (TVL).","The RWA narrative unfolds as political parties advocate for regulations to foster a positive environment for cryptocurrency.","This can be seen in the upcoming UK election as the Labor Party promises to continue the Conservative Party\u2019s legislative efforts¬†to make the UK a \u201Cglobal hub for crypto assets technology.\u201D","Investment bank Citi Group estimated that tokenized assets could be worth close to $4 trillion globally by 2030 in a report published in 2023.
