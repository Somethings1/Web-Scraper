Legal action, including criminal and civil proceedings, are underway.","Haru Invest suspends deposit and withdrawal services due to fraudulent management reports provided by its operating partner, B&S Holdings (formerly Aventus). Legal action, including criminal and civil proceedings, has been initiated.https:\/\/t.co\/q1P959Jnty","\nDelio followed suit the next day, likely due to concerns regarding counterparty exposure. Haru Invest has since downsized its staff significantly and is taking legal action against its service partner.","As a registered virtual asset provider (VASP), Delio falls under the regulation of South Korea\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit. However, Haru Invest, being a non-VASP, remains outside the jurisdiction of regulators.","The investigation by the FSC underscores the importance of regulatory oversight and investor protection in the crypto lending sector.","Stakeholders are closely monitoring the developments of this case, as it may have broader implications for the regulatory framework and transparency requirements for virtual asset providers in South Korea.","The investigation into Delio brings to the forefront the inherent risks associated with engaging in the crypto industry. With its decentralized nature and lack of traditional oversight, the crypto sector has attracted both legitimate businesses and bad actors alike.","Cases like Delio serve as cautionary tales, underlining the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks that can effectively address and mitigate such risks.","By implementing stringent regulations, authorities can establish clear guidelines for market participants, promoting transparency and accountability throughout the industry.","In addition to robust regulatory frameworks, effective risk management practices are imperative for the long-term stability and sustainability of the crypto lending sector.","Market participants must adopt rigorous risk assessment protocols, conduct thorough due diligence on potential partners, and implement robust internal controls. These would help identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, fortifying operations against fraudulent activities and unforeseen market fluctuations.\nÂ "],"entity":[{"type":"\u2019s Financial Services Commission (FSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Haru Invest","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Financial Intelligence Unit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jung Sang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VASP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$8.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"B&S Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Delio","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June 14","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Haru Invest","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 17","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$200 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Delio","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 27","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 13","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["CRYPTO","Crypto Exchange","Cryptocurrency","South Korea"],"authors":["Lockridge Okoth"]}
