Many wondered if bitcoin (BTC) would be included in any way.","And somebody did find a way to include it.","The first one to reveal the trailer to the world earlier this week seems to have been the Twitter account \u2018Gta6trailerleak.\u2019","And though the account was banned pretty quickly, everything stays on the Internet. Other accounts saw it and started sharing it.","Therefore, it can still be found today.","Notably, the \u2018Buy BTC\u2019 is prominently placed throughout the shared video.","Guy leaked the GTA VI trailer with a \u201CBuy $BTC\u201D watermark","Legend üíØ","The trailer looks dope, it\u2019s the most anticipated game in history.","A message the world needed to hearüëèüèΩ","Study #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com\/pfWsLofmsX","\u2014 Wall Street Bitcoin (@WallStreetBTCX) December 4, 2023","","It is safe to say that the company wouldn\u2019t have taken this route \u2013 to cover the entire video \u2013 even if it were to feature BTC anytime in the future.","The fifth installment of GTA was launched in September 2013. The game is developed by the British development house Rockstar North.
