It was opened in 1969 by the government of East Germany as a symbol, not just of the city, but also of Communist power. It remains a significant landmark, the tallest structure in Germany, and the third-tallest in the European Union. ","And this landmark was chosen as the canvas for the Bitcoin logo.","The #bitcoin logo is on the Berliner Fernsehturm tower in Berlin right now pic.twitter.com\/Wn2b3koWUH","It is unclear who the individual or the group behind the project is, however, one Twitter user seems to have inside knowledge about this series of BTC promotions around Berlin. ","Tilo Neumann shared a video of the logo projected on the tower:","pic.twitter.com\/oZ1YFr2RDG","Sharing yet another video of the projector in action, Neumann spoke briefly about the reason behind this project. He invited people to come to Alexanderplatz on January 21, saying that it may get media attention. Replying to a commenter who argued that people of Berlin cannot invest in BTC as they no longer have money, Neumann said that,","\u201CBerlin is definitely not rich, that\u2019s probably true. Nevertheless, \u201Cwe\u201D want to draw attention to Bitcoin. After all, it is about our financial future. Some people sit down on the street and stick to it, \u201Cwe\u201D have decided to do it differently.\u201D","This wasn\u2019t the first attempt to promote Bitcoin on the tower, however. Neumann noted that there had been an earlier attempt to do so, but that the \u201Cprojector wasn\u2019t strong enough to conquer\u201D the tower. ","As to where they got the projector from in the first place, he said that it is \u201Cfrom our own stock.\u201D He went on to say that they \u201Cbought a DIY\/beamer and downloaded HD Bitcoin pictures.\u201D","In November, the projector was taken to the sight of another world-known iconic site: the Berlin Wall. The wall was a concrete barrier raised to separate West and East Germany from 1961 to 1989. ","Neumann wrote that,","\u201CNothing in Berlin is as steeped in history as the Berlin Wall. That\u2019s why we carried out our campaign here this time. This place represents endless suffering. In contrast, Bitcoin stands for hope, the hope for a fair and free world.\u201D","A post earlier in January this year argued that the world has had the fiat standard for long enough and that it\u2019s time for a change, while another said that wars could be prevented if they could no longer be financed with new fiat.","\u201CI think we\u2019ve done a lot to make bitcoin more visible to the general public,\u201D Neumann said, adding: \u201CBitcoin is the future.\u201D","Tilo Neumann describes himself as a Bitcoiner, investor, and CEO. The link on his Twitter page leads to \u2018The Best of Blockchain\u2019 website, a conference that will be held on October 5-7, 2023 in Berlin. ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Crypto Billionaire Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin May \u2018Crash Back Down\u2019 If This Happens \u2013 Here\u2019s What You Need to Know\n\u2013 Germany\u2019s N26 Bank Bucks the Trend, Seeks to Expand its Crypto Trading Offering to More Countries\n\n\u2013 UK Ad Regulator Sends \u2018Enforcement Notice\u2019 to Crypto Promoters\n\u2013 Spending on US Crypto TV Ads Shrunk From USD 85M to USD 36K in 5 Months \u2013 Report"],"entity":[{"type":"Neumann","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1961","content":"DATE"},{"type":"East Germany","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1989","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Promoters\n\u2013 Spending on US Crypto TV Ads Shrunk From USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1969","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Marien","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January 21","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Arthur Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Berlin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"N26 Bank Bucks the Trend","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tilo Neumann","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Germany","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"7, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","advertising","Bitcoin","Germany","Investing"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
