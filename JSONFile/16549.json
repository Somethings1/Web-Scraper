For example, on Aug. 29, 100 BTC (worth over $4.8 million) from one hacker-linked address was split up and sent to two separate addresses, then further broken into smaller pieces and distributed to yet more addresses.","At least some of that bitcoin was then sent to addresses believed to be generated by a Wasabi wallet, according to Crystal Blockchain data.","This was one of many similar transactions that the hackers made using Wasabi, presumably to disconnect the stolen funds from their criminal history, according to Crystal. This would be a necessary step to spend such funds or sell them for fiat money, because centralized exchanges tend to freeze funds that are known to come from hacks, exploits and scams.","Over 437 BTC (worth over $20 million) associated with the Liquid hackers have been laundered using Wasabi\u2019s CoinJoin feature, and the process is still ongoing, according to Crystal.","Earlier this month, CoinDesk tracked other funds funneled out of Liquid, finding that ether and ERC20 tokens were sent to Ethereum-based online mixer Tornado.cash and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).","Wasabi is a privacy-focused desktop wallet that allows users to make their bitcoin less traceable on the public ledger by arranging so-called CoinJoin transactions. Multiple users can commingle their bitcoin in joint transactions and get it back disconnected from the previous history of payments. It also routes transactions over the Tor network which further helps to conceal the user\u2019s IP address.","Although Wasabi is a non-custodial wallet that doesn\u2019t store users\u2019 funds, it generates addresses for CoinJoin transactions that blockchain analytics tools have learned to identify. Crypto sleuthing firm Elliptic did this last year, following bitcoin coming from the infamous Twitter hack to addresses associated with Wasabi.","According to Kyrylo Chykhradze, product director for Crystal Blockchain, identification of such addresses is more challenging than attributing addresses to custodial crypto services, so Crystal makes \u201Ca lot of double-checks before the final labeling\u201D of the addresses in their analytics system.","Wasabi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","According to Crystal Blockchain, wallets associated with the Liquid hackers received some 1,168 BTC in total, most of which they got by swapping other cryptocurrencies for bitcoin on several exchanges.","CoinDesk previously reported that the hackers sent stolen XRP tokens to three exchanges \u2013 Binance, Huobi and Poloniex \u2013 where they managed to exchange them for bitcoin on the first day after the hack. That bitcoin stash was later partially laundered via Wasabi\u2019s CoinJoin addresses, according to Crystal.","ERC20 tokens, which run on the Ethereum blockchain, had been sent to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), swapped for ether and then sent to Tornado.cash, an online mixer for ether. Some tokens were also swapped for bitcoin on the decentralized exchange Ren, resulting in additional 394 BTC in the hackers\u2019 stash, Chykhradze said.","\u201CFor almost two weeks hackers have been using different methods to cover their tracks \u2013 substantial amounts of XRP, ETH and ERC20 tokens were either converted into BTC or mixed through the Tornado tumbler service,\u201D Chykhradze said.","Plus, several dozen BTC were put on multiple unidentified wallets and left there for now.","Liquid, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, was hacked on Aug. 18. About $97 million worth of multiple cryptocurrencies were siphoned out. The exchange immediately started publishing updates on the hack and the addresses to which the hackers withdrew money.","Several exchanges worked with Liquid to label and block the addresses related to the hackers, they previously told CoinDesk. However, in many cases the hackers managed to get funds out faster than the exchanges reacted.","On Aug. 30, Liquid posted an update urging users to generate new deposit wallets."],"entity":[{"type":"Crystal Blockchain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aug. 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aug. 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aug. 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Chykhradze","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$97 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$20 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Elliptic","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kyrylo Chykhradze","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crystal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Huobi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Hacks","Bitcoin","Wasabi Wallet","CoinJoin","Liquid Exchange"],"authors":["Anna Baydakova"]}
