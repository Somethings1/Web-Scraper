In response to what some have called Eigen Labs\u2019 overly complicated white paper and relatively limited rewards, users have queued to withdraw about 25,000 ether (ETH), worth about $72.7 million, from the platform.","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","Eigen Labs, which recently raised $100 million from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, essentially pioneered the concept of restaking \u2014 the ability to reuse capital to staked on Ethereum to simultaneously secure other blockchains. Nearly $16 billion has been locked on the platform, which has been called the single biggest innovation in crypto in years.","According to the Eigen Foundation\u2019s announcement on Monday, 15% of the initial 1.67 billion EIGEN tokens will be set aside for the community and distributed over multiple \u201Cseasons.\u201D Early users who accrued \u201Cpoints\u201D will be airdropped the first 5% of those reserved tokens \u2014 with one point equating to one token. This could equate to a hefty reward for users who have long been clamoring for a native Eigenlayer token.","However, many are annoyed with the project\u2019s plan. Of particular concern is that the tokens will be initially non-transferable, essentially making the cash reward worthless. Additionally, 30% of the tokens will go to Eigen Labs investors, with another 25% earmarked for \u201Cearly contributors.\u201D While investors and early contributors also won\u2019t be able to immediately sell their tokens, the vesting schedule starts when they receive the tokens \u2014 raising concerns a lot of tokens will be sold off once they become transferable.","\u201CEigenLayer team and investors are getting 55% but stakers are getting only 5% and even that will not be transferable at the beginning,\u201D crypto trader CoinMamba said on X.","As The Block reported, the token distribution plan echoes Starknet\u2019s token airdrop that stirred controversy in February, before it was reformed after community backlash. Starknet\u2019s token was created a year before it was made available for trading, which gave investors a headstart on their vesting schedule and meant they were able to sell off just weeks after trading commenced.","Another point of contention is that many Eigenlayer users will be cut out of the airdrop. Residents of the U.S., Canada and China are not going to receive tokens (alongside Russia), and users who interacted with the system via a VPN, a popular means of protecting privacy by routing through virtual networks, will also be shut out. This rankled some critics because users from these countries aren\u2019t barred from interacting with the platform, though they are being excluded from the reward.","\"Accepting stake from those countries and not rewarding them isn\u2019t right,\u201D crypto researcher Aylo said on X. \u201CThey took a very real risk for nothing.\"","For its part, Eigenlayer said that making the token non-transferable for a few months will enable the platform to decentralize and work out how the token could be used. \u201CCertain goals should be accomplished in the coming months before the EIGEN is made transferable and forkable,\u201D the company said.","While some parts of the community backlash are more valid than others, it\u2019s hard to fault Eigenlayer\u2019s plan to geofence U.S. users, given the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) unclear guidance on airdrops. As Variant Fund lawyer Jake Chervinsky noted on X, the SEC has \u201Csteadfastly refused to provide a workable pathway\u201D for crypto token registration, putting Eigenlayer\u2019s team in potential legal jeopardy.","\u201CNon-transferability and geofencing are both useful options when it comes to managing regulatory risk around token distributions. They just aren\u2019t the only options, nor are they necessarily the right ones for every team and token,\u201D he added. Making an asset non-transferable limits any \u201Creasonable expectation of profit,\u201D a key part of determining whether an asset is a security.","See also: EigenLayer-Powered Aligned Layer Raises $20M","Further, Eigenlayer is not the first and certainly won\u2019t be the last project to block U.S. users or exclude them from token rewards programs. While this policy does punish users who would otherwise be handed essentially free money \u2014 or money earned for just clicking a few buttons \u2014 it is a reasonable response to the situation.","\u201CBoth of these options are on the conservative end of the regulatory risk spectrum for token distributions. I call this a spectrum for a reason: given a lack of regulatory clarity, every team (with the advice of their counsel) has to decide how much risk to take on,\u201D Chervinsky wrote.","It\u2019s an interesting day when projects said to be at the cutting edge of financial innovation are forced to take a conservative approach.","See also: Why EigenLayer May Be the Most Innovative New Protocol Since Ethereum","CORRECTION (MAY 1, 2024): Corrects amount of ETH queued to withdraw from the platform.","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$16 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jake Chervinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"EIGEN","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Eigen Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andreessen Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"VPN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eigen Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aylo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MAY 1, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Eigenlayer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"55%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Chervinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$20M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$72.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","EigenLayer","Ethereum","Staking","Restaking","Airdrops","SEC","The Node","Newsletters"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
