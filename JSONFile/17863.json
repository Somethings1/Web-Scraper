Who can forget 2017 (peak crypto) \u2014 crypto was the hottest trend. The talk of the town not forgetting the initial coin offering (ICO) phase.","After the ICO bubble popped there was an attempt to make \u201Csecurity token offerings\u201D (STOs) and \u201Cinitial exchange offerings\u201D (IEOs) a thing but this fizzled out too.","In 2018, the WEF saw more chatter around Bitcoin and how some cryptocurrencies were a fad, but blockchain technology was here to stay. Then eventually crypto and blockchain technology took a back seat at Davos and chatter around the importance of regulation continued on a yearly basis.","In 2019, attendees continued to try and revive the sector, with many verbally bashing crypto as fad. Back then at the WEF, Jeff Schumacher, founder of BCG Digital Ventures, said: \u201CI do believe it [bitcoin] will go to zero. I think it\u2019s a great technology but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a currency. It\u2019s not based on anything.\u201D","Between 2020-2023 (excluding 2021 when the WEF was cancelled due to Covid) \u2013 crypto continued to remain on the outskirts \u2013 although addressed and included (for diversity) it is no longer the hot new trend as it was in 2017. Despite crypto players desperately trying to revive the sector with cool afterparties and Bitcoin pizza day \u2013 crypto remains niche,  a bit like Marmite.","Cryptonews touched base with attendees on the ground in Davos, Switzerland.","\u201CAt Davos, WEF attendees have been discussing the recent approval of ETFs and how this significant achievement could potentially lead to widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies,\u201D said Marcos Benitez, head of sales Switzerland for Copper.co.","\u201CMany countries are looking to the United States to follow a similar regulatory framework. It\u2019s worth noting that within the first two days of the listing of various Bitcoin ETFs, a staggering $4.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency had already been traded,\u201D added Benitez.","CoinDesk producer and anchor Christine Lee, who is at Davos said the crypto crowd gathered this year is optimistic due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the ETFs.","\u201CThe crypto vibe in Davos 2024 is decidedly more optimistic thanks to the SEC\u2019s approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs, driving the market higher in anticipation of further institutional adoption. When the news was announced last week, entrepreneurs at CfC St. Moritz, a highly curated crypto conference pre-Davos, were popping champagne bottles, and the wine continued to flow at the various parties throughout the World Economic Forum this week,\u201D said Lee.","Lee has attended numerous events in Switzerland explains many crypto companies are back on the Promenade in Davos, though their operations have scaled back coming off the bear market.","\u201CCircle is opting for private meetings rather than last year\u2019s blowout party and Filecoin Foundation has dialed back their budget. Others making repeat appearances include Hedera, Caspar Labs, 1 Inch, the Global Blockchain Business Council, CV VC, and Skybridge Capital,\u201D said Lee.","Here is a round up of some of the interesting coverage coming out of Davos relating to the cryptocurrency sector.","Reuters, Divya Chowdhury and Lisa Pauline Mattackal report hedge fund SkyBridge\u2019s Anthony Scaramucci believes Bitcoin\u2019s price could breach $170,000 next year, driven by demand for newly listed exchange traded-funds and April\u2019s halving event. \u201CIf bitcoin\u2019s at $45,000 on the halving, where it roughly is right now, it\u2019ll be $170,000 by mid- to late 2025,\u201D the SkyBridge founder and managing partner told the Reuters Global Markets Forum at Davos.","CNBC\u2019s Arjun Kharpal and MacKenzie Sigalos report that, artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be dominate the Promenade far more than crypto firms this year, reversing a trend from the past few years. The duo look back at their previous converge of crypto at Davos.  In January 2023, as the crypto winter had set in, firms pulled back on splashing the cash at Davos, but there was still a heavy presence from the industry, inclduing a mysterious orange bitcoin car. Today it seems Davos is all about AI which is dominating the WEF.","Financial News, Bilal Jafar reported, the crypto world has long headed to Davos in January, but has rarely been admitted inside the WEF. Instead, it has chosen to represent itself outside the heavily guarded conference. Jafar reports, crypto seeks legitimacy at World Economic Forum as Ripple president urges \u2018mature players\u2019 to attend."],"entity":[{"type":"the World Economic Forum (WEF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bilal Jafar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lisa Pauline Mattackal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Anthony Scaramucci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Marmite","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jeff Schumacher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CfC St. Moritz","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"World Economic Forum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SkyBridge","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Divya Chowdhury","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Benitez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Caspar Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Davos","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"the World Economic Forum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Filecoin Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MacKenzie Sigalos","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Reuters Global Markets Forum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arjun Kharpal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Christine Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hedera","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$4.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Marcos Benitez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Global Blockchain Business Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$45,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BCG Digital Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$170,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"WEF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Skybridge Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Davos","World Economic Forum"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
