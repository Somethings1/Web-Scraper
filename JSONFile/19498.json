However, after a five-hour hearing, his outlook changed.","\u201CI went into SEC v. Coinbase hearing thinking COIN would, on this motion, win dismissal of SEC\u2019s primary claims (concerning trading) but maybe not staking and broker claims. I left thinking COIN would win full dismissal,\u201D Stein wrote in the X post.","I went into SEC v.

Stein (@NYCStein) January 19, 2024","","The SEC has accused Coinbase of offering investment contracts (also known as securities) by staking customer assets. The exchange has received staking rewards in returns, which it has paid back to its customers.","Additionally, the regulator alleges that Coinbase operated as an unregistered broker.","Coinbase, on its end, has rejected the claims, and focused its defense on the difficulty it has faced in registering with the SEC for a license.","According to Stein, a pivotal moment in the hearing occurred when Coinbase provided a more precise definition of an \u201Cinvestment contract\u201D than the SEC, emphasizing the requirement for an investment in a business with an \u201Cenforceable obligation.\u201D","Stein referenced the SEC vs. Ripple case, where Ripple achieved a partial victory in 2023 after the judge ruled that XRP is \u201Cnot in and of itself\u201D a security.","Specifically, the judge made it clear that XRP should not be seen as a security when sold to retail investors, although it could be deemed a security when sold to institutional investors.","\u201CAs the Ripple ruling in July suggested, sales of digital assets on public exchanges don\u2019t fit neatly into the Howey test for what constitutes an investment contract,\u201D Stein wrote in his note.","He added that even if the case survives, it will likely reach the Supreme Court, and said Coinbase has \u201Cgood arguments that the SEC\u2019s allegations don\u2019t sufficiently plead that it was performing broker functions.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Elliott Stein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$COIN","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Elliott Z.
