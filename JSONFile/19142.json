Warren Warns US Military Officials, Claims Iranian Crypto Mining Supports Terrorism","category":["Bitcoin News "],"content":["US Senator and highly vocal crypto critic, Elizabeth Warren, has claimed that Iranian crypto miners have terrorist ties including Hamas.","In an open letter dated May 1, Sen. Warren and Sen. Angus King Jr. have together warned that this \u201Congoing activity by the Iranian government threatens our national security.\u201D","The lawmakers have called the Biden administration to provide information on the efforts \u201Cto combat Iran\u2019s rampant evasion of U.S. and international sanctions through crypto mining.\u201D","The Senators particularly raised alarm on Iranian crypto mining firm\u2019s ties to fund Hamas, through the \u201Csteady revenue\u201D from mining.","The letter had details about Iran\u2019s massive crypto mining operations for past several years. \u201CCrypto mining has become increasingly lucrative for Iran,\u201D it added.","\u201CIran legalized the crypto mining industry in 2019. In the five years since Iran has raised millions of dollars through mining crypto, a steady revenue source that allows it to purchase imports, move funds domestically and internationally, and fund Hamas and other terrorist organizations.\u201D","Further, estimates suggest that Iranian Bitcoin mining could have \u201Cproduced as much as $1 billion in revenue in 2021\u201D. This is mainly due to the Iranian Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade issuing 1,000 licenses for cryptocurrency mining units so far, despite these operations sucking massive electricity power.","Apart from the highly profitable crypto mining, the Senators have accused the nation\u2019s ability to launder funds using cryptos.","For instance, they mentioned how the nations largest crypto exchange Nobitex\u2019s website provides guidelines to users on avoiding sanctions. Notably, Binance processed $8 billionworth of Iranian crypto transactions in a four-year period flowing through Nobitex.","Furthermore, the Iranian military has had a history of having ties with ransomware gangs. During Iran\u2019s attack on Israel, the former\u2019s military has used crypto to fund known terrorist groups like Hezbollah.","\u201CIran\u2019s use of crypto to evade sanctions poses a direct threat to our national security,\u201D the legislators stressed. \u201CUnless we take action, Iran will continue to use crypto to fund attacks against Israel.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"May 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Warren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Iranian Ministry of Industries","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Angus King Jr.","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$8 billionworth","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hamas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hezbollah","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Israel","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Iran","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Elizabeth Warren","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Mining","Elizabeth Warren","Iran"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
