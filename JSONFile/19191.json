These also aim to bring crypto trading platforms under the Capital Markets Board\u2019s (SPK) control. The SPK would then license and supervise these platforms.","Other areas of regulation include how platforms store customer\u2019s cash and crypto penalties that apply for breaking the rules. Specific rules for how these platforms operate will be decided later. This will be done through additional regulations that will be created separately.","Earlier this year, Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said the country\u2019s crypto regulations were in its final stages. He added that they aim to reduce crypto trading risks and establish licensing and operating standards for trading platforms.","An additional benefit is that they could help Turkey improve its standing with the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s standards.","A recent Statista study revealed that Nigeria and Turkey led in terms of crypto adoption and the proportion of crypto owners among 56 countries as of Feb. 2024.
