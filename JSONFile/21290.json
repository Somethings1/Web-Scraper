That previous Federal Reserve bosses, Greenspan and Bernanke, had little grasp of empirical reality is something we only discovered a bit too late [\u2026] which is why we need to be careful on who to endow with centralized macro decisions.\u201D","Taleb further concludes that Bitcoin\u2019s structural design is what could make \u201Ca zero intelligence crowd [work] better than a Soviet-style management composed to maximally intelligent humans.\u201D","He does not reject the notion that Bitcoin might fail \u2013 but is positive in his belief that, should it fail, we, as a society, would simply invent an improved version as an insurance against \u201Can Orwellian future.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bernanke","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Greenspan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Saifedean Ammous","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Taleb","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
