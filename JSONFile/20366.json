Due to security concerns, we do not make such on-chain wallet information and confirmation information publicly available through a cryptographic Proof-of-Reserve, or other advanced cryptographic accounting procedure.","In crypto, proof of reserves is a methodology that allows users to prove whether or not an independent auditor has the reserves of a specific exchange or business. It uses Merkle Trees to capture data and get a set of fingerprints that let users verify that their funds were properly audited by a third party.","Grayscale acknowledged that its decision to keep its reserve information private would be a \u201Cdisappointment\u201D to some investors. However, the company claimed that \u201Cpanic sparked by others is not a good enough reason to circumvent complex security arrangements that have kept our investors\u2019 assets safe for years.\u201D","Nevertheless, the recent revelation has only exacerbated user confidence in Grayscale.
