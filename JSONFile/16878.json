Instead of requiring five of eight wallets to sign off on transactions, it had changed to only two out of eight, as reported.","The transactions represented the first time the project's multisig wallet \u2013 which held 26 trillion tokens out of a 420 trillion total supply \u2013 had ever sent out the meme coin.","But whoever is in control of the project now has been apologetic on X posts, stating they plan to grow, and eventually fully decentralize, the project in the months ahead.","\u201CI have been in negotiation with the owners of some web domains and usernames that I am looking into acquiring for PEPE, and when I am complete with any of these prospective purchases or donations of PEPE from the multi-sig, I will burn the remainder of these multi-sig tokens,\u201D they said. Burns refers to the permanent deletion of tokens from the open market.","Pepe was one of 2023\u2019s biggest success stories amid a generally bearish market, zooming to a peak market capitalization of $1.8 billion in mid-May and seeing trading volumes surpass those of dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) \u2013 which are otherwise the biggest meme coins by trading volume.","However, analysts have repeatedly rang the alarm bells around the early activity of pepecoin traders as well as the absence of retail traders. The major risk has been too many tokens in too few hands, leaving the price action dependent on a few investors.","\"The limited amount of net liquidity is creating a high-stakes game of music chairs,\u201D shared Rafe Tariq, senior quant at SingularityDAO in a research note in June. \u201CEveryday investors are being lured in with the hopes of big profits but the reality is that a small percentage of investors will walk away with profit, while everyone else will get burnt.\"","At the time, SingularityDAO also found that a small number of large-scale investors, known as \"whales\", hold up to approximately 25% of PEPE, while other large investors hold up 46% of the currently circulating supply.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Rafe Tariq","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"PEPE","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Burns","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Pepecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$PEPE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kucoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"mid-May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Pepe","DeFi","token","On-chain Data"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
