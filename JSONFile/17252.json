Biden as a crypto holder, understand that this administration\u2019s intention is to destroy the US crypto industry,\u201D he noted.","These claims are not without merit. Under Biden, the SEC has taken an aggressive regulation-by-enforcement approach to the crypto industry.","The agency\u2019s underlying assumption is that virtually all cryptos aside from Bitcoin are actually securities, bringing them under its jurisdiction.","The SEC explicitly labeled ADA as a security, which weighed heavily on its price in 2023.","The Biden administration has been accused of conducting \u201Coperation choke point 2.0\u201D to debank crypto firms in the US.","The SEC has also tried to stifle crypto through other means, including its SAB 121.
