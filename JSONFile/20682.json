Each cash transfer amounted to tens of millions of yuan.","The operation\u2019s staggering scope became apparent when it was revealed that the group had transferred over 2.25 billion yuan ($300 million) to overseas entities through this method.","Their cumulative profits from the elaborate money laundry scheme exceeded an astonishing 22.62 million yuan."],"entity":[{"type":"Sichuan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"several million yuan","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jiang Moumou","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chongqing","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Zheng Moumou","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Xiamen","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Anxi","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tongliang Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$68,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fujian Province","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$300 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Zheng","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"22.62 million yuan","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"November 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2.25 billion yuan","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["China","USDT"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
