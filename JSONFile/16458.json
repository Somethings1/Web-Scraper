Eventually, cryptocurrencies were able to sustain a multi-month rally, with BTC ultimately hitting an all-time high in March of this year.","\"Bitcoin is in the 'bore you to death' phase,\" Charles Edwards, founder of crypto hedge fund Capriole Investment said in an X post Thursday.","This period of consolidation could last for anywhere between one to six months, he explained, during which BTC will be rangebound with low volatility until market participants lose their patience.
