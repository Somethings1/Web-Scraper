McHenry, French Hill, Tom Emmer and Warren Davidson. ","Lawmakers also accused SEC Chair Gary Gensler of \u201Cusing this proposal to push his own personal views regarding digital assets.\u201D","\u201CChair Gensler has previously made statements on his own behalf claiming that DeFi exchanges are essentially equivalent to traditional intermediaries in financial markets even if they call themselves something different,\u201D they said. ","The lawmakers also accused the SEC of \u201Cattempting to front-run Congress\u201D when they themselves with the House Agriculture Committee are working on legislation to regulate digital assets.","Leaders in both the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee have released draft legislation to regulate crypto including measures that would \u201Cclassify cryptocurrencies as a security or a commodity and regulate exchanges, among other measures.\u201D","McHenry said during a hearing on Tuesday that he wants to hold a vote on that bill by mid-July. ","\u201CThis is a draft bill,\u201D he said during that hearing. \u201CThere\u2019s plenty of time for us members to find common ground on how we legislate here, but be advised I intend for this committee to markup some form of this legislation when we return from the July 4 recess.\u201D "],"entity":[{"type":"Tom Emmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"House Agriculture Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Patrick T.
