Roaring Kitty was a major champion of beaten-down stock GameStop prior to its stunning 2021 pump.","Roaring Kitty\u2019s GameStop position is thought to have surged to as much as $50 million in 2021 at its peak.","Other popular stocks during the 2021 meme stock craze also picked up. AMC Holdings (AMC) was up 45% on Monday.","The return of Roaring Kitty hasn\u2019t just sparked excitement in meme stock markets. Indeed, there has been a surge in risk-taking activity in across the crypto meme coin space.","Scores of meme coins related to Roaring Kitty, Gamestop, and the 2021 meme stock craze are pumping.","Roaring Kitty (KITTY) was up 21,000% in 24 hours, as per DEXTools. Wall Street Bets (WSB) was up 4,500%. And GamgeStop (GME) was up 2,200%.","None of these meme coins have any official connection to the original persons\/communities\/companies. They are purely just borrowing the name.","Additionally, none of these meme coins, beyond their 2021 meme stock craze links names, have any real utility or prospect of long-term growth.","Traders looking for the next GME stock should check out these meme coins instead.","","Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 9% on Monday as traders grew excited that it could be the next GME stock.","Dogecoin is the largest and oldest meme coin by market capitalization and was last near $0.1550.","The meme coin\u2019s market cap is a whopping $22.2 billion.","But many think DOGE will one day reach $1, which would see its market cap swell to over $140 billion.","Investors willing to ride the DOGE rollercoaster could be looking at 6.5x gains if $1 is reached.","That might not be as impressive as GME\u2019s 2021 gains. But Dogecoin remains one of the best meme coin bets.","The second largest meme coin in crypto, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is another good bet for the next GME stock.","SHIB was last up 7.5%, eyeing an upside break from a pennant structure.","That could reignite a quick surge back to March highs above $0.000045.","That would be a near 100% rally from current levels near $0.000024.","Like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has a dedicated, massive community with over 3.8 million followers.","As a result, it is likely to stay a major player in the meme coin space in the long term.","Wood!

Slothana could soon take the crown as the biggest Sloth meme coin.","As meme coin risk appetite returns, it could become a multi-billion-dollar coin. Slothana is a good bet for the next GME stock.","Another exciting meme coin with novel cross-chain capabilities called Dogeverse (DV) is available in presale.","Dogeverse is a multi-chain spin on Dogecoin, launching on the six most used blockchains, excluding Bitcoin, with multi-chain bridge capabilities.","There are a host of chains out there vying to be the go-to destination for meme coin launches \u2013 Dogeverse plans to fit the bill by being present on all¬†chains that matter.","Get on the degen train before it rides into the wrong #Wormhole!#DOGE #Memecoins #Altcoins #Solana #Base #Ethereum","\u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) May 6, 2024","","The multi-chain meme coin has raised more than $15 million so far.","Potential investors don\u2019t have long to buy before launch.
