Judge Kaplan gave a sentence below what the guidelines recommended.\u201D","Enzer added that he thinks Bankman-Fried\u2019s punishment is \u201Cvery reasonable under the circumstances balancing all the considerations.\u201D ","For instance, he pointed out that Judge Kaplan provided Bankman-Fried with a \u201Clight at the end of the tunnel,\u201D recognizing that he is still a young person. ","\u201CGiven all this, it\u2019s not hard to see how the sentence is substantially reasonable,\u201D said Enzer. ","He also noted that the sentencing procedure followed all federal rules and U.S. constitutional requirements.  ","Phillip Alexeev, Chief Growth Officer at payment solution provider CrossFi, also believes that Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence is fair, yet for other reasons. ","\u201CIf you look at the sentence length in proportion to the amount of assets in question, as well as comparable sentences for other financial crimes, 25 years is actually in line with what I would have expected,\u201D said Alexeev.","Alexeev added that he believes the sentence was most likely a reflection regarding the number of impacted individuals, the total value of impacted assets, and the precedent-setting power of the verdict as it pertains to crypto regulations.","Unsurprisingly, Bankman-Fried has decided to appeal both his conviction and his prison sentence. ","\u201CI think it was a foregone conclusion he would appeal, once he decided he wasn\u2019t going to accept responsibility and not plead guilty and maintain innocence in testimony,\u201D said Enzer. ","Enzer expects Bankman-Fried to likely argue that his conviction was improperly obtained. ","\u201CHe may also say he didn\u2019t get a fair trial or make other arguments challenging the conviction itself,\u201D added Enzer. ","Interestingly, Bankman-Fried\u2019s decision to appeal could result in an even longer prison sentence. Enzer pointed out that this scenario happened during the prosecution of former defense attorney Lynne Stewart. ","\u201CThat is the only time I remember a Circuit saying that a sentence is too low,\u201D he said. ","While this is technically possible, Enzer believes it\u2019s extremely unlikely that Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence will increase.","Rather, Enzer believes that the most likely outcome will be for The Second Circuit Court of Appeals to affirm, agreeing that the conviction was appropriate and that the sentence was within the bounds of the judge\u2019s discretion. ","Enzer pointed out that The Second Circuit Court of Appeals could find an error that may be reversible in the way the sentence was done, however. In this case, it would go back for a rehearing. ","\u201CI doubt they would lower the sentence, though. I think this is a fair sentence,\u201D said Enzer. ","Margaret Rosenfeld, Principal of DeFi advisory firm Zukunft Advisory, told Cryptonews that Bankman-Fried\u2019s appeal would probably result in oral arguments before judges. She explained that this process can take years to work its way through. ","\u201CIn the meantime, SBF will be in prison while the appeal process goes forth,\u201D said Rosenfeld. ","She added that litigators following the trial do not expect any success with the appeal.","Although questions persist around Bankman-Fried\u2019s case, Enzer believes there is an important lesson to be learned from the FTX saga. ","\u201CThis shows that we are as a society able to weed out bad actors, whether they are associated with blockchain technology or Wall Street,\u201D he said. ","Given this, Enzer noted that there should not be a full-blown dismissal of the transformative promise of blockchain technology and digital assets due to one bad actor. ","\u201CThere are many legitimate good faith actors in this industry. The brush is getting cleaned out from the original wild west cowboy days of crypto, and we are moving into a  new phase of maturity and compliance and guardrails to protect consumers,\u201D he said. \u201CI think it\u2019s good to have this dark chapter behind us and we should look forward to the next chapter of digital assets.\u201D ","Yet Rosenfeld advises the crypto industry to proceed with caution.  ","\u201CThere are many good actors in the blockchain sector,\u201D she said. \u201CBut as we enter into a new bull cycle, are participants doing their due diligence now? Are venture capital firms and influencers that are backing projects taking on more of a guardian role to ensure that projects are doing what they say they are doing?\u201D  ","Unfortunately, Roseneld believes these questions have yet to be answered. "],"entity":[{"type":"Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Margaret Rosenfeld","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Roseneld","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"The Second Circuit Court of Appeals","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alexeev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zukunft Advisory","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Laura Shin (","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Rosenfeld","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Enzer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Phillip Alexeev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Samson Enzer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 28, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lynne Stewart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lewis Kaplan","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["FTX","Sam Bankman-Fried","SBF"],"authors":["Rachel Wolfson"]}
