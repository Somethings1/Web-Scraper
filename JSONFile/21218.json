The national Bitcoin Office is a government entity aimed at managing all projects related to the cryptocurrency.","Per a Reuters report, the nation mined nearly 474 Bitcoins since 2021 using geothermal power fueled from the Tecapa volcano.","JUST IN: üá∏üáª El Salvador mines 474 #Bitcoin worth $29 million using its volcano-fueled geothermal power plant.","\u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) May 15, 2024","","The power plant\u2019s official data released Tuesday, noted that the government holdings accounts to over $354 million at current prices. With the BTC wealth pool, the nation launched a Website on Tuesday for tracking its Bitcoin Treasury.","The nation\u2019s current Bitcoin holdings and the launch of a memepool website, signifies that El Salvador might eventually become one of the wealthiest countries in the world.","Interestingly, President Bukele also stated that he has¬†no plans to sell the country\u2019s vast Bitcoin holdings.¬†Bukele\u2019s administration has installed 300 processors to mine Bitcoins from the volcano, the report added.","The geothermal state-owned power plant devotes 1.5 megawatts (MW) to cryptocurrency mining, out of its 102 MW produced.","\u201CWe don\u2019t spend resources that contaminate the environment, we don\u2019t depend on oil, we don\u2019t depend on natural gas, on any resource that isn\u2019t renewable,\u201D Daniel √Ålvarez, president of the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Executive Commission, which oversees the plant, told AP News back in 2021.","Bitcoin mining in El Salvador would appear to have a supportive government in Bukele. However, when it comes to cheap electricity, the nation imports about one-fifth to one-quarter of its electricity. The rest of the electricity production is divided among hydroelectric, geothermal and plants fired by fossil fuels.","Among those, geothermal accounts for about a quarter of the country\u2019s energy, given that El Salvador has 20 active volcanoes.","According to a 2021 report, the energy produced from the geothermal turbines source about 300 computers. Bitcoins are \u201Cmined\u201D using computers that solve complex mathematical problems and require a large amount of electricity to operate.","First steps\u2026","üåã#Bitcoinüá∏üáª pic.twitter.com\/duhHvmEnym","\u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) September 28, 2021","","In an industry that still relies heavily on polluting coal-fired power plants, the Salvadoran government is touting the use of clean energy for local mining."],"entity":[{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September 28, 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AP News","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$29 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Daniel √Ålvarez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bukele","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bukele","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nayib Bukele","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Executive Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$354 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tecapa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Mining","El Salvador","Geothermal Power"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
