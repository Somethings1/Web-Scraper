MPs had taken the matter into their own hands, defying the government by backing a private member\u2019s bill calling for an amendment to the tax law.","Sisa Journal noted that the bill has bumped the \u201Ceffective date of taxation\u201D by \u201Cone year from January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2023.\u201D But \u201Cactual tax payments,\u201D the media outlet remarked, will not \u201Cbegin until May 2024.\u201D\n\nAnother, potentially more valuable Christmas gift was also forthcoming: MPs said they would use next year to discuss the matter of allowing traders to make carryover deductions on their tax bills and even raising the threshold for tax payment from the existing rate of USD 2,100 a year. Some MPs are keen to create parity with stock trading taxation regulations.","The South Korean blockchain consultant Mira Kim told Cryptonews.com:","\u201CI can tell you that there will be quite a few very happy crypto traders celebrating this news over the weekend throughout the country.\u201D","Sisa Journal quoted Oh Gap-su, the President of the Korea Blockchain Association, as saying:","\u201CWe welcome the [National Assembly\u2019s] postponement of the implementation of taxation on cryptoassets. As the grace period has been extended, we will do our best to establish a stable system, cooperate with tax policy and contribute to national economic development.\u201D","One commenter on the Sisa Journal article wrote, with no shortage of irony:","\u201CMr. Moon doesn\u2019t know what to do about this issue, so he has decided to let the next administration deal with the problem [of crypto].\u201D","This has been a long battle. Keenly aware of the unpopularity of the tax, which MPs had already been voted into law months ago, when it was bundled with other reforms to the Income Tax Act, politicians decided to move on the matter ahead of next year\u2019s March general election.","After the tax was approved, the government was hit with a wave of disapproval, with petitions calling for the tax to be scrapped submitted to the presidential office, the Blue House.","The government and key regulators gave these a frosty reception, drawing ire from many crypto-keen younger voters. Opposition leaders leaped on the matter with glee: young voters have tended to vote for the ruling Democratic Party in recent years, and the main opposition People\u2019s Power Party responded by calling for an end to the tax and forming a crypto taskforce.","Eventually, the Democratic Party leadership caved and joined calls for a delay to the tax, although the government continued to voice its displeasure right to the end. MPs clambered abroad the cause, leading to a \u201Cglut\u201D of bills calling for a delay coming before National Assembly committees.","After a tireless campaign from the pro-crypto industry People\u2019s Power Party MP Cho Myung-hee, MPs finally united behind a single bill, creating a \u201Cde facto\u201D consensus in parliament ahead of the vote \u2013 leading media outlets to call the vote a \u201Cformality.\u201D","The government remained defiant and bitterly opposed to the change right to the very end. But, ultimately, it was unable to turn back the tide of what became a rare National Assembly-wide consensus.","Per Sisa Journal, as well as iNews24, MPs were also aware of opposition from the crypto industry, and agreed that the tax was \u201Cpremature,\u201D as there was \u201Cno proper definition of cryptoassets\u201D in South Korean law, no was there a \u201Ctax infrastructure or system in place.\u201D Another reason, they claimed, was that \u201Cthere is no institutional mechanism for cryptoassets to be properly protected like other asset classes.\u201D","At the end of this battle, the real winners in the matter appear to be crypto traders. ","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 South Korean Draft Law Calls for Life Sentences for Crypto Market Manipulators\n\u2013 \u2018New Blow\u2019 as Large Crypto Exchanges Are Told to Pay British Tech Tax\n\n\u2013 IRS Warning: The Taxman Cometh \u2013 For \u2018Billions of Dollars\u2019 Worth of Crypto\n\u2013 Argentina U-Turns On Crypto Tax With New Regulation"],"entity":[{"type":"Blue House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sisa Journal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korean","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Democratic Party","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moon Jae","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January 1, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 1, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"People\u2019s Power Party","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"People\u2019s Power Party MP Cho Myung","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"[National Assembly","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sisa","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"British Tech Tax\n\n\u2013 IRS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Argentina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"National Assembly","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mira Kim","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December 3","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Taxman Cometh \u2013 For \u2018Billions of Dollars\u2019 Worth of Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Korea Blockchain Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency","Investing","Regulation","South Korea","Tax","Trading"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
