In his view, the multichain world will exist on top of Ethereum. ","\u201CWe believe that Ethereum is going to be the ultimate settlement layer and on top of it there will be a lot of layer two\u2019s that will be built and connected with it,\u201D he said.","When asked to name Polygon\u2019s key competitors, he mentioned StarkWare, a competing Ethereum L2 developer, which recently closed a USD 50m Series C funding round led by Sequoia Capital. ","He also said that Polygon is going to deploy an increasingly aggressive acquisition strategy moving forward.  ","\u201CI mean, we want to become the transaction layer of Ethereum and we\u2019ll constantly keep on doing that,\u201D he said.\n____","Watch the full interview and hear what Sandeep Nailwal has to say about Polygon\u2019s goals, the upcoming Ethereum merge, NFTs, multichain future, competitors, their M&A strategy, and more. \n  ","The interview is brought to you by Matt Zahab and Eimantas Žemaitis.\n__","The transcript of the interview:","How has 2021 been for Polygon so far?","It\u2019s been really great, it has been a really rewarding journey. On the same side, it has been very very taxing \u2013 like you know I think we all aged like five or maybe ten years in the last two or three years. So definitely I\u2019ve picked up weight, lost hair \u2013 the same with my team \u2013 so it\u2019s been rewarding as well as hard-working time for us.","What are your strategic expansion goals for 2022?","The strategic expansion plan from our side is very heavily focused towards the zero-knowledge technology. We recently announced a billion-dollar fund on zero-knowledge and then out of that we\u2019ve done multiple acquisitions, we\u2019ve announced Polygon Hermez, which was the first zero-knowledge product that we launched. Then we also did Polygon Nightfall which is with the Ernst & Young, one of the big four companies in the world in terms of auditing consultancy. And then we have multiple other initiatives also on that front to be launched very soon and we\u2019ll be very very heavily focused on zero-knowledge in the next six to eight months and we believe that zero-knowledge is the ultimate holy grail for the blockchain scaling and that\u2019s where we are going.  ","How might Polygon be affected by the upcoming Ethereum merge? Any plans to combat this?","No no, it\u2019s actually very positive for any layer 2. See, all layer 2 projects have to put some data or some proofs back to Ethereum, and right now that costs a lot. So when the merge comes and Ethereum becomes like, let\u2019s say from 13 transactions to 30 transactions per second with this much proof of stake merge \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about the sharding, like 64 shards thing, which is at least like 3 to 5 years away if at all it is coming, we\u2019re only talking about the merge that is happening which is proof-of-stake, and many people think that ok, the whole sharding ETH 2.0 is coming \u2013 it\u2019s not. It\u2019s simply the merge from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, and then Ethereum is going to have like probably thirty transactions per second from there. It\u2019s good for us, it\u2019s good for all the layer 2 projects overall.","What trends do you see in Polygon and how is Polygon going to be used in the NFT space more specifically? ","So NFT, already like, I mean again, this is not a very widespread knowledge somehow but NFTs Polygon is the biggest project. Like we recently spoke with somebody, I mean I can\u2019t name but one of the biggest analytics platforms and they were doing analytics on Instagram for example so you know 80% of the Instagram NFTs are on Ethereum, 15% are on Polygon and the rest 5% is on others\u2026 So Ethereum plus Polygon form like 95% of the NFT market. So you know Polygon does not have those big like you know 100 million dollar NFTs but the smaller NFTs which is what Polygon is built for \u2013 games and metaverses \u2013 Polygon has the leading position in that and we\u2019re the largest NFT platform in that sense. We have probably 500 plus games deployed on Polygon and growing day-by-day.","How is the multichain blockchain landscape looking moving forward?","I mean we\u2019ve been very clear that [the] world is going to be multichain but we feel that multichain is not on the layer 1 but on layer 2. So we believe that the world will be multichain but the multichain world will exist on top of Ethereum instead of multiple layer 1\u2019s existing \u2013 we don\u2019t believe in that thesis. We believe that Ethereum is going to be the ultimate settlement layer and on top of it there will be a lot of layer two\u2019s that will be built and connected with it. ","Who do you see as your main competitor right now and how are you going to combat them?","StarkWare. I think that on the zero-knowledge side, I think that StarkWare is the most formidable team, and with our multiple zero-knowledge efforts, we believe that, you know, we would be able to edge ahead on that but StarkWare is a very formidable team. ","With how quickly you and your team are growing right now would you ever consider a fresh capital raise?","We actually, yes, we would be doing something in the future, and, you know, planning for something we might do a small capital raise.","Your M&A strategy moving forward? ","It\u2019s going to be more and more aggressive, you know, I mean, we want to become the transaction layer of Ethereum and we\u2019ll constantly keep on doing that.\n___\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Ethereum, Solana, Polygon & Co Form A New Hot Market Of Blockchains \n\u2013 Multi-Chain Future Brings Multiple Competitors to Bitcoin & Ethereum \u2013 Analysts\n\u2013 Ethereum Needs to Try Harder To Keep Its Dominance in a Multichain Future "],"entity":[{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sequoia Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"last two or three years","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Multi-Chain Future Brings Multiple Competitors to Bitcoin & Ethereum \u2013 Analysts\n\u2013 Ethereum Needs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Polygon Hermez","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Eimantas Žemaitis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sandeep Nailwal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"95%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Polygon & Co","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Polygon Nightfall","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nailwal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Matt Zahab","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sandeep","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ernst & Young","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","M&A","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Polygon","Scalability"],"authors":["Eimantas Žemaitis"]}
