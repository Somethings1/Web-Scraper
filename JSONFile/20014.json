What\u2019s more, he reiterated the need for caution due to the \u201Cmyriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201D","In other words, Gensler made it clear that the approval is not an indication of the SEC\u2019s broader stance on crypto assets, and the chair stressed the importance of investor vigilance in crypto specifically.","In her own statement that was also published on the SEC\u2019s website, Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce criticized the agency\u2019s past handling of spot Bitcoin ETFs. She suggested that \u201Cdisproportionate attention\u201D and staff resources were dedicated to blocking such applications over the past decade.","\u201CWe squandered a decade of opportunities to do our job. If we had applied the standard we use for other commodity-based ETPs, we could have approved these products years ago, but we refused to do so until a court called our bluff,\u201D Peirce, who is known as \u2018crypto mom\u2019 for her crypto-friendly stance, wrote."],"entity":[{"type":"Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hester Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201D Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["ETF","SEC"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
