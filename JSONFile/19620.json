Meanwhile, users couldn\u2019t access their airdropped tokens.","As BaseScan data shows, within hours of the airdrop, the largest holder, \u201CMurphys1d,\u201D sold over 55,000 of the newly issued $FRIEND.","This led to an immediate 53.3% drop in the token\u2019s price from $3.26 to $1.30 as of writing.Â ","","Beyond the sell-off, some users were unable to claim their airdrop, forcing them to watch helplessly as $FRIEND\u2019s price plummeted. Crypto investor Luke Martin commented that this just \u201Cadds insult to injury.\u201D","Watching the value of my airdrop go from 7 figs to 5 figs in the span of 2hrs while I keep refreshing the page trying to claim\u2026.still can't claim.","Meanwhile I gotta watch this guy cashout while my wallet won't even load.","Adds insult to injury ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€","\u2014 Luke Martin (@VentureCoinist) May 3, 2024","","In a low liquidity environment, a few large orders can have an outsized impact on the market price.","$FRIEND only had $0.01 worth of liquidity, leaving holders vulnerable.Â ","The extremely low liquidity evoked outrage within the community.","\u201CFirst you milk your users with fees, then you get them to add liquidity so that they can dump on each other,\u201D disgruntled X user mcSleuth commented.","","The Friend.tech dump is just one example of a professional airdrop farmer dumping on markets. These \u201Csquatters\u201D interact with emerging protocols solely for the airdrop rewards, often with multiple wallets to compound rewards.","This comes at a heavy cost to the communities surrounding the protocol squatters\u2019 targets. Dumps create major selling pressure, causing legitimate protocol users to panic and sell their holdings as well, further compounding the issue.Â ","In April 2024, Omni Network was similarly affected by Sybil farmers. Their native OMNI token fell 55% in less than 18 hours following its airdrop, losing over half of its market capitalization.Â ","While these events can have a huge negative impact on price action, it\u2019s often only short-term. $FRIEND may struggle following this event, but its community of investors may pull it through in the long term."],"entity":[{"type":"$0.01","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"53.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$3.26","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 3","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 3, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.30","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"55%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Omni Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$FRIEND","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Luke Martin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Airdrop","price crash","Whale"],"authors":["Harvey Hunter"]}
