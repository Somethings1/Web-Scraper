Buterini wrote:","\u201CIf proof of personhood is not solved, decentralized governance becomes much easier to capture by very wealthy actors, including hostile governments.\u201D","However, Buterin also pointed out that if a system like Worldcoin continues to decentralize as promised, it will avoid \u201Cdependence on centralized authorities and reveal the minimal information possible.\u201D","The Ethereum co-founder\u2019s first concern was related to privacy\u2014and the act of scanning someone\u2019s iris.","Buterin feared this could capture much more data than met the eye, including a person\u2019s sex, ethnicity, and even certain medical conditions.","Buterin also expressed concerns over accessibility and centralization within the Worldcoin Foundation and security. ","According to the latest figures from Worldcoin, as the year progressed, they had made 1,500 Orbs accessible in 35 global cities, leading to a significant surge in the total number of weekly registrations from 40,000 to 200,000 individuals.","In total, Worldcoin estimated that two million people had already signed up for a World ID.","However, Buterin expressed skepticism saying, \u201CEven with much higher-scale distributed manufacturing, it would be hard to get to a world where there\u2019s an Orb within five kilometers of everyone.\u201D","In his concluding remarks, Buterin emphasized his belief that a world without proof-of-personhood presents its own set of risks and potential dangers. ","He acknowledged that constructing a resilient system would be neither straightforward nor swift.","\u201CI definitely do not envy the people undertaking this task, and it will most likely require several years to discover a formula that proves effective.\u201D ",""],"entity":[{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Idenam","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Worldcoin Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vitalik Butrein","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
