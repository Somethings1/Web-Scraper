She\u2019s been our longest serving independent director \u2013 was our first audit\/risk chair, was on our comp committee, and\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/AtZGpwaYf3","\u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) April 20, 2024","","Likewise, Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, applauded Haun as the \u201Cultimate weapon in the board room that any CLO would want.\u201D","The resignation will officially take effect at Coinbase\u2019s upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which is scheduled for later this summer. The board anticipates a reduction in its overall size, shrinking to seven members following Haun\u2019s departure. ","The change also marks the loss of one of the two women currently serving as board directors, underlining the ongoing need for greater diversity and representation within the cryptocurrency industry.","Earlier this month, investment banking firm KBW hailed Coinbase for offering investors a unique opportunity to tap into the long-term growth potential of the crypto economy and increased its price target for COIN to $230. ","In a research analysis, KBW raised its Coinbase price target from $160 to $230 while maintaining its market performance rating. ","Meanwhile, Coinbase has also faced its fair share of regulatory trouble. ","Last month, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase can proceed.","The Judge\u2019s decision came after Coinbase filed a motion to dismiss the SEC case, which borders on allegations the exchange operates as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.","In her ruling, Judge Failla declared that the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase held \u201Cplausible\u201D ground. ","\u201CThe Court finds the SEC has sufficiently pleaded that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and through its Staking Program engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities,\u201D the court document read.","She granted a partial victory to the exchange against the regulator, however, dismissing the SEC\u2019s claims against Coinbase\u2019s Wallet."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Haun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"The Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Haun Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Armstrong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"KBW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase\u2019s upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$160","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US District Court of the Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CLO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Katherine Polk Failla","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Failla","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase\u2019s Wallet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kathryn Haun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 20, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$230","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Andreesen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Paul Grewal","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","Crypto Regulation"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
