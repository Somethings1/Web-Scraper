Trump, are among the firms that have received payments from Fairshake.","Additionally, the group has enlisted the services of polling firms Schoen Survey Research and Global Strategy Group, which work with numerous congressional Democrats.","On Capitol Hill, Porter has been a close ally of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been a vocal critic of the lax regulations surrounding cryptocurrency.","In October 2022, Porter joined Warren in sending a letter to Texas regulators addressing crypto-related concerns.","Meanwhile, Schiff, who has been actively campaigning to boost Garvey\u2019s chances over Porter, has a statement about the crypto industry on his policy page, writing about the need to nurture such innovative industries.","\u201CWe need to develop comprehensive regulatory frameworks to ensure that these companies and jobs stay here and grow here,\u201D the page reads.","Notably, Fairshake and its affiliated groups have already made smaller campaign contributions to candidates such as Representative Patrick McHenry, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.","They have also supported Shomari Figures, a Democrat running for the House in Alabama, who has pushed for digital assets like cryptocurrency to drive innovation and technological advancement."],"entity":[{"type":"Fairshake super PAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eleanor Terrett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Barbara Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"California Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$85 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jamestown Associates","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Schoen Survey Research and Global Strategy Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Andreessen Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Warren","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Schiff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Donald J.
