But the CME\u2019s potential Bitcoin trading plan signifies a continued push from Wall Street giants into the crypto space. This follows the SEC\u2019s green light in January for Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.","According to the FT, it plans to offer its potential spot Bitcoin trading business through EBS. This is a Swiss currency trading platform known for its strict regulations on crypto asset trading and storage.","A CME Group spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.","The addition of spot Bitcoin trading to the CME\u2019s existing Bitcoin futures offerings would open doors for investors to easily execute \u2018basis trades,\u201D according to the FT.","Basis trades involve borrowing money to sell futures contracts while simultaneously buying the underlying Bitcoin, aiming to profit from the small price difference between them. This strategy is already a staple in the US Treasury market, with a significant portion happening on CME platforms.","CME has grown to become one of the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin futures market, dethroning Binance. This surge reflects a renewed wave of institutional investor interest seeking to capitalize on Bitcoin\u2019s volatility.","A 2020 Bitwise Asset Management study found that the CME Bitcoin futures market consistently outpaces the spot market.","In a move to boost transparency and trust in cryptocurrency trading, CME Group has joined forces with CF Benchmarks. Together, they\u2019ve developed standardized reference rates and spot price indices for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. This collaboration provides a clear and reliable picture of cryptocurrency values."],"entity":[{"type":"US Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chicago Mercantile Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EBS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitwise Asset Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CME Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CME","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","CME Group"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
