Kirsten Gillibrand (@gillibrandny) April 17, 2024","","The senators introduced the \u201CLummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act\u201D in 2022 and reintroduced it last year in hopes of creating stricter digital asset regulations.","\u201CPassing a regulatory framework for stablecoins is absolutely critical to maintaining the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance, promoting responsible innovation, protecting consumers and cracking down on money laundering and illicit finance,\u201D said Senator Gillibrand. \u201CThe bipartisan Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act preserves the dual banking system and gives both federal and state agencies roles in chartering and enforcement.\u201D","Passing stablecoin legislation has been a hot topic on Capitol Hill in recent months. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) and Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) reportedly pitched an unreleased proposal to Senate Majority Leader Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) last week tying stablecoin reform to the upcoming funding reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).","Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has resisted her colleagues\u2019 efforts, however, claiming that advancing such legislation without effective anti-money laundering laws could expose a number of security risks. ","For years, Warren has been trying to pass the \u201CDigital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act\u201D (DAAMLA), which would put such stringent anti-money laundering laws in the crypto sector.","\u201CWe need a regulatory framework that will put the rules for Anti-Money Laundering in place so that we do not have more opportunities for Iran and terrorists and drug lords and human traffickers to make more money,\u201D Warren said during a recent hearing. ","With Brown seemingly on board with approving a stablecoin bill, it may only be a matter of time before new stablecoin legislation is passed."],"entity":[{"type":"Chuck Schumer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Warren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Federal Aviation Administration (FAA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sherrod Brown","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Patrick McHenry","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elizabeth Warren (","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Senator Gillibrand","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brown","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kirsten Gillibrand","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 17, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cynthia Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gillibrand Responsible Financial","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Iran","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gillibrand","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulation","daamla","Stablecoin Bill"],"authors":["Julia Smith"]}
