If mediation fails to yield an agreement, the case is slated to proceed to trial in February 2024.","The cause of this dispute is centered around what are termed \u201Cpreferential payments\u201D made by 3AC to BlockFi before the declaration of bankruptcy.Â ","Preferential payments, also known as preferences, are payments made to creditors ahead of a bankruptcy filing, allowing the creditor to collect more than they would have received in a bankruptcy proceeding.","In a confidential report earlier this year by 3AC\u2019s liquidator, Teneo disclosed intentions to reclaim a substantial $1.2 billion from Digital Currency Group (DCG) and BlockFi. Of this, the claim against BlockFi stands at $284 million. BlockFi\u2019s bankruptcy estate has countered 3AC\u2019s claim by alleging that the hedge fund engaged in fraudulent activities.","Should the mediation process fail to lead to a resolution, a two-day hearing is scheduled for February 5, 2024, during which the parties will determine the precise amount of funds to be returned.","Judge Kaplan, who presided over the proceedings, acknowledged the gravity of the matter, stating, \u201CWe\u2019re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201D He expressed concern that the dispute is already pushing the calendar out further than he\u2019d like for desperate creditors and that he is committed to getting it done quickly.","Judge Kaplan emphasized his commitment to swift resolution, postponing 3AC\u2019s motion to lift the stay until the February hearing. \u201CThis is the best I can do,\u201D Kaplan said, saying 3AC\u2019s move to lift the stay will be postponed until the February hearing.","BlockFi and FTX both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late November, with BlockFi vehemently contesting efforts by FTX and Three Arrows Capital to reclaim billions of dollars from transactions prior to their bankruptcy filings the previous year.","BlockFi, facing claims totaling over $483 million from FTX, argues that it is being unfairly targeted. In an August court filing, BlockFi revealed losses exceeding $1 billion due to alleged fraud at FTX. BlockFi has urged the court to reject FTX\u2019s claims, invoking the doctrine of \u201Cunclean hands\u201D to protect its creditors from further harm. However, FTX\u2019s primary objective has always been to recover loan repayments, and collateral pledged to BlockFi before BlockFi\u2019s bankruptcy filing.","However, the judge recently approved a partial repayment plan for BlockFi\u2019s creditors despite opposition from FTX\u2019s legal team. FTX lawyers condemned the proposed deal, viewing it as unfair to their creditors, and pushed for its rejection in court due to how it could impact FTX\u2019s restructuring efforts.","In a separate filing, BlockFi accused the defunct Three Arrows Capital, 3AC, of using fraudulent means to borrow money. Some of the funds were repaid when Three Arrows failed to respond to a margin call, and BlockFi foreclosed on posted collateral. BlockFi asserts that Three Arrows owes them for this deficiency and that no outstanding debts are owed to Three Arrows.","In response, 3AC, insists that BlockFi owes them over $220 million. They argue that any attempts to diminish these claims may violate bankruptcy protection regulations.","Furthermore, Three Arrows Capital has invoked a bankruptcy pause under Chapter 15 protection to safeguard its assets in the United States, contending that BlockFi\u2019s efforts to reduce these claims could potentially infringe upon the protection granted by Chapter 15."],"entity":[{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$284 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$220 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Teneo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Three Arrows Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"late November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Three Arrows","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$483 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["BlockFi","FTX","Three Arrows Capital"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
