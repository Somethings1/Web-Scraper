In a recent announcement on Twitter, Circle, and Stellar jointly revealed that USDC is currently available through the CoinMe digital crypto wallet.","This development considerably broadens the influence of both entities and underscores the benefits of the Stellar network, potentially leading to a positive impact on XLM\u2019s value.","Adding fuel to the positive trajectory, Stellar has forged a link with the Polkadot ecosystem by utilizing the Pendulum parachain, which is being hailed as the ultimate connector between traditional fiat currencies and decentralized finance

surpassing both the 50-day EMA ($0.0899) and the 100-day EMA ($0.0896).","This configuration indicates that the short-term trend is bullish, with the 20-day EMA serving as a supportive base.","The

placing it firmly in overbought territory.","Although this may prompt caution among some traders, it simultaneously signifies robust buying pressure.","Therefore, traders should remain vigilant and monitor the RSI for any indications of a reversal.","However, as it stands, the elevated RSI value bolsters the bullish case.","As for the current market activity, XLM is trading at $0.1092, achieving a gain of 2.63% so far today.","The cryptocurrency is facing immediate resistance within the range of $0.1155 to $0.1167.","Should XLM break above this resistance range, it could signal further upside

trend reversal.","A new player in the decentralized digital currency arena, DeeLance, is introducing a platform that empowers individuals from all corners of the world to engage in productive
