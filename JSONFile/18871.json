He said:","\u201CThey did so in an effort to mislead lenders into believing that DCG had absorbed massive losses that Genesis incurred from the Three Arrows Capital Ltd. (3AC) collapse and induce lenders to continue making loans to Genesis. By lying, they hoped to buy time to dig themselves out of the hole they created.\u201D","In the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse, Genesis announced that it is temporarily suspending redemptions and new loan originations. In a statement on Twitter, Genesis says the \u201Cabnormal withdrawal requests\u201D have exceeded its \u201Ccurrent liquidity.\u201D","Following the announcement, Gemini Trust Earn, a program that offered high-interest accounts thanks to a partnership with Genesis Global, also halted redemptions in mid-November. Reportedly, around $900 million of Gemini\u2019s customer funds are locked in Genesis. ","Notably, this is not the first time Cameron has lashed out at Silbert in an open letter. Just last week, he issued an open letter to Silbert, accusing him of \u201Cbad faith stall tactics\u201D and asking him to find a solution by January 8. ","While no announcement came from Silbert, Derar Islim, the interim CEO of Genesis, told clients that they need more time to resolve the financial crisis plaguing their lending business. He said:","\u201CWhile we are committed to moving as quickly as possible, this is a very complex process that will take some additional time. We believe we can arrive at a solution.\u201D","Back in November last year, Silbert tried to reassure investors that they are financially stable, claiming that most of its entities are \u201Coperating as usual.\u201D He even said that they are on the pace to generate $800 million in revenue this year on the back of just $25 million raised in primary capital since inception. ","Meanwhile, Silbert had previously said on Twitter claiming that DCG delivered a proposal for resolving the dispute to Genesis and Winklevoss\u2019s advisers on December 29, but had received no reply. ","DCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis\n\nDCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding; next loan maturity is May 2023\n\nDCG delivered to Genesis and your advisors a proposal on December 29th and has not received any response",""],"entity":[{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Winklevoss","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Genesis\n\nDCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.675 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cameron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"mid-November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$25 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gemini Trust Earn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$900 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Three Arrows Capital Ltd.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Genesis Global","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Derar Islim","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Digital Currency Board (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 29th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cameron Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$800 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Gemini"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
