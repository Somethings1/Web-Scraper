Riot Platforms has set a long-term goal of reaching 100 EH\/s by 2027 or shortly after. ","Currently, the company holds the third-largest hash rate among miners, trailing behind Marathon Digital and Core Scientific.","Following the announcement, Riot\u2019s share price experienced a 2.87% decline on May 1, reaching $9.82. ","However, it rebounded slightly with a 1.1% increase in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. ","Notably, Riot Platforms achieved impressive results in 2023, with total revenues reaching an all-time high of $281 million.","Earlier this year, Riot has joined the Texas Blockchain Council (TBC) to sue the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), accusing the agency of making unlawful data collection demands from the Bitcoin mining sector.","Bitcoin miners, including Riot Platforms, have been adjusting their operations after the halving event on April 20, which reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, equivalent to approximately $180,600 at present.","As reported, a notable outflow of Bitcoin from miners could be on the horizon in the months following the upcoming halving event.","In a recent note, Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, estimated that Bitcoin miners have the potential to liquidate approximately $5 billion worth of BTC after the halving.","Asset manager CoinShares analysis suggests that Riot, TeraWulf, and CleanSpark are among the best-positioned companies to weather the impending storm."],"entity":[{"type":"$79.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$281 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2.87%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Markus Thielen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"144%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Google Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10x Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"55.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$180,600","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Riot Platforms","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"first quarter of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2027","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Texas Blockchain Council (TBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jason Les","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"89%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$9.82","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US Energy Information Administration (EIA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$23,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"131%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"14%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"36%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$74.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Corsicana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Marathon Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$211.8 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Mining","Riot Platforms"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
