The legal fees include a $3.25 million earmarked for employees\u2019 legal bills. Other payments by the firm include $1.3 million for a pending lawsuit in the UK.","Terraform Labs claims that fact-finding from the lawsuit will help in its defense against the SEC. Despite the pending lawsuits, the SEC argued that huge payments to the firm could undermine the visibility of the company\u2019s spending. Furthermore, investors stand to benefit if the funds are channeled that way.","The regulator also pointed to a potential conflict of interests between Dentons and Terraform Labs still based on investors receiving the money.","\u201CThe SEC said that none of those payments can be allowed without more oversight from the bankruptcy court, arguing Terraform\u2019s \u201Cstaggering\u201D retainer payment had served to undermine the bankruptcy court\u2019s visibility into Terraform\u2019s spending,\u201D Reuters wrote.","Per written arguments, the regulator urged the court not to allow Denton to represent Terraform Labs until the firm refunds $81 million left in the retainer account.","Future fees incurred by the company should also be subject to the court\u2019s oversight to limit amounts payable to investors and to preserve the company\u2019s assets.","In a move that links its former CEO to the matter, the SEC alleged that the sum in the Denton Advance Payment Retainer could be used to cover the legal bills of Do Kwon in Montenegro.","The bankruptcy court in Delaware will entertain the dispute on March 5 as investors wait to recover their losses. In 2022, Terra\u2019s stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar resulting in widespread industry losses that played a role in the crypto bear cycle.","Both the United States and South Korea are looking to have Do Kwon extradited to face charges. However, a Montenegro judge ruled Do Kwon\u2019s extradition in favor of the US, where his trial is set to begin later next month."],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Delaware","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$122 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3.25 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Terra\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Denton Advance Payment Retainer","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terraform Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$6.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$166 mln","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$166 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 29, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Denton","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$81 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Do Kwon","Lawsuit","Terraform"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
