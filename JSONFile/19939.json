Despite this, OPNX launched on April 4, after which VARA issued an Investor and Marketplace Alert.","Dubai\u2019s crackdown on OPNX is a sign that the country is adopting a stricter approach to regulating the crypto space despite ambitions to establish itself as a global hub for the industry. ","The push also coincides with broader efforts by the UAE to move off the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s \u201Cgray list\u201D of jurisdictions that do not do enough to uncover illicit funds.","Zhu and Davies created OPNX, dubbed Open Exchange, in partnership with Lamb and Arumugam for trading crypto-related bankruptcy claims.","Since the collapse of their fund, they have made Dubai one of their primary bases, although they were previously headquartered in Singapore.","In a comment to Bloomberg, Leslie Lamb said that OPNX has not done any marketing targeting Dubai or the UAE and is cooperating with VARA\u2019s investigation.","\u201CAt no point in time have UAE customers been able to open an account on OPNX,\u201D she said. ","Zhu said in a separate message that \u201Cwhile Kyle and I helped contribute the initial ideas for OPNX, Leslie is very much the CEO and we aren\u2019t involved in the day-to-day.\u201D","Three Arrows Capital was one of the most prominent hedge funds and trading firms in the crypto industry.","The company filed for bankruptcy in July last year, declaring its business had \u201Ccollapsed in the wake of extreme fluctuations in cryptocurrency markets.\u201D ","Despite all the media engagement and marketing, Open Exchange had a lackluster start, with a first-day trading volume of just $13.64.","By day five, the volume had surged to $12,398, which is still insignificant compared to the booming market for crypto bankruptcy claims. ","We're thrilled to announce a significant increase in trading volume at OPNX! On day 1, our volume was a hard-fought $13.64. Today on day 5, it has surged to a magnificent $12,398. That's a remarkable percentage increase of over 90,000%.
