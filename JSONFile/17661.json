Eisenberg is accused of stealing an estimated $110 million out of the crypto exchange Mango Markets by utilizing their cryptocurrency MNGO for fraud.\n","Originally arrested in December 2022, Eisenberg is facing one count each of commodities fraud, commodities manipulation, and wire fraud related to the cryptocurrency scheme.","Prosecutors allege Eisenberg sold off a large number of Mango Markets\u2019 signature cryptocurrency, MNGO, to himself before making \u201Ca series of large purchases\u201D with \u201Cthe objective of artificially increasing the price of MNGO relative to USDC and, in turn, the price of MNGO Perpetuals on Mango Markets.\u201D","\u201CEisenberg\u2019s manipulative trading caused the price of MNGO Perpetuals on Mango Markets to rise approximately 1300% in a period of approximately 20 minutes,\u201D a press release from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York reads.","From there, the alleged fraudster was able to borrow and withdraw over $110 million from the exchange, all of which came from other customers \u2013 eventually causing Mango Markets to collapse.","Despite the criminal charges, Eisenberg claims his supposed crypto scheme was not outside the law, going so far as to call it a \u201Chighly profitable trading strategy.\u201D","Statement on recent events:","I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week.","\u2014 Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) October 15, 2022","","\u201CI believe all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are,\u201D he wrote in a statement on X in 2019.","Following Mango Markets\u2019 insolvency, Eisenberg said he \u201Chelped negotiate a settlement agreement\u201D in hopes of making \u201Call users whole as soon as possible as well as recapitalizing the exchange.\u201D","Eisenberg\u2019s trial comes at a major moment for crypto policy and regulation following the stringent sentencing of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Like Bankman-Fried, Eisenberg faces an uphill legal battle as less than 1% of federal defendants are tried and acquitted.","The Department of Justice (DOJ) has taken a proactive approach to addressing cryptocurrency-related issues. Since then, it has tried a number of high-profile cryptocurrency-related cases, including Bankman-Fried.","\u201CExploiting decentralized finance platforms is the new frontier of old school financial crimes in which criminals abuse emerging technologies for their own personal gain,\u201D Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. said. \u201CWith this prosecution, the Criminal Division is sending the message that no matter the mechanism used to commit market manipulation and fraud, we will work to hold those responsible to account.\u201D","If convicted, Eisenberg faces a maximum penalty of forty years in prison."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1300%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Department of Justice (DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Criminal Division","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October 15, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Avraham Eisenberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Eisenberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Manhattan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"the Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kenneth A.
