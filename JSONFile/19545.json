Speaking to Andy Shechtman, CEO of Miles Franklin Precious Metals, Kiyosaki advocated investors to turn to gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum.","He stressed that the dollar decline is imminent, which is why accumulating alternative investments is vital to be prepared for adverse financial conditions. \u201COur money is fake,\u201D he noted.","\u201CIt\u2019s a reason to buy gold, silver, Bitcoin, and all this because our currency is screwed up now, it\u2019s going to get worse because our debt keeps going up.\u201D","Kiyosaki revealed that he bought Ethereum \u201Cfor the same reason.\u201D","Further, he criticized the lack of financial literacy education in schools, particularly when there is an already dire financial situation. Kiyosaki also pointed out the absence of counterparty risk issues when it comes to borrowing money.","\u201CIf I borrow money, who\u2019s the guy to pay me back? And gold and silver \u2013 you don\u2019t need that \u2013 the same as Bitcoin, you have no counterparty risk.\u201D","","The bestselling author in March, described the world\u2019s largest crypto \u2013 Bitcoin \u2013 as \u201Cthe perfect asset at the right time.\u201D However, he is also having a cautious approach to the asse-class, doubting its potential to be scam or Ponzi scheme.","Kiyosaki has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin over the years. In November 2023, the financial educator said that Bitcoin is the \u201Cbest protection\u201D against hyperinflation because it is people\u2019s money. He drew a historical comparison and urged his followers to consider Bitcoin as a means of protection against hyperinflation.","However, he wasn\u2019t keen on the spot Bitcoin ETFs, claiming that these financial products are apt for institutional investors. He rather favors direct ownership of physical assets due to his entrepreneurship pathway.","Kiyosaki has invested in a mix of assets like gold, silver, Bitcoin, which according to him are bargains today."],"entity":[{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kiyosaki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Robert Kiyosaki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kiyosaki","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andy Shechtman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Miles Franklin Precious Metals","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Robert Kiyosaki"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
