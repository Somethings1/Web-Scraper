Prates is a central bank lawyer and researcher.","In Joseph Heller\u2019s famous novel, a Catch-22 refers to a stipulation that pilots seeking to be excused from their combat duties could file a request stating they are insane. With one catch: filing the request implies that the petitioner is sane and, thus, ineligible to be excused.","In 2024 America, the SEC\u2019s \u201Ccome in and register\u201D approach is a Catch-22 for crypto.","SEC Chair Gary Gensler often says that registering with the SEC to comply with securities regulation is straightforward, \u201Cit\u2019s just a form on our website.\u201D And crypto issuers and exchanges \u201Care just choosing not to do it\u201D despite knowing how to do it. The SEC chair makes it sound like crypto firms have been unreasonably (if not unlawfully) stubborn in not filing the required registrations in the face of a welcoming SEC. This characterization hides a catch.","Even if we assume, as Gensler does, that all crypto tokens are securities and should be registered with the SEC \u2014 which is debatable \u2014 and that the registration process is simple \u2014 which is not \u2014 successful registration would lead to a dead end. Registered crypto tokens, like any registered securities, could only be traded on registered exchanges through registered broker-dealers. But that\u2019s impossible today.","The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization that oversees broker-dealers, has approved just a few institutions to deal with crypto tokens. Among these institutions, only one is a Special Purpose Broker-Dealer, Prometheum, which remains inactive and hasn\u2019t yet listed a token to trade almost one year after the approval.","See also: Aspiring Crypto Bank's Plight Shows Binance's Issues","The SEC, moreover, hasn\u2019t allowed any currently registered exchange or broker-dealer to list, custody or trade crypto tokens. The SEC\u2019s view is that any registered institution willing to work with crypto tokens \u201Ccould not deal in, effect transactions in, maintain custody of, or operate an alternative trading system for traditional securities.\u201D","Further, virtually no crypto tokens have been registered with the SEC so far. And that\u2019s the Catch-22: issuers won\u2019t register their crypto tokens before they can find registered exchanges and broker-dealers that can work with them, and registered exchanges and broker-dealers won\u2019t start working with crypto tokens until they see enough tokens registered to make the business model economically viable.","The reality for fintech isn\u2019t much brighter. Because of the lack of a specific federal licensing framework, fintech firms using technology to offer more efficient and cost-effective financial products and services \u2014 from debit cards and loans to mobile payments and remittances \u2014 must partner with banks. This fintech-banking partnership is known as banking-as-a-service or BaaS.","Even when the fintech startup is a licensed money transmitter at the state level, it must partner with a bank to make and receive payments in dollars since only banks can directly access the payments system. As a result, licensed banks in the U.S. end up serving as gatekeepers to financial innovation, as new ideas in the financial system have to be implemented through them.","The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the national banking regulator, has been increasingly wary of BaaS arrangements, making it more difficult and costly for banks to keep \u201Cthird-party relationships\u201D with fintech firms. Regulators say they\u2019re concerned with how fintech partners onboard customers, monitor transactions and handle sensitive information, as well as how banks manage these risks to ensure compliance with the applicable rules and regulations.","Because of this hardened regulatory stance and the enforcement actions and fines that may follow, many banks are \u201Cderisking\u201D by reducing or outright ending fintech partnerships. At the same time, federal regulators aren\u2019t open to crafting a licensing regime for fintech or allowing non-banks to directly access the payments system by having a Fed master account.","There we have another Catch-22: in the present regulatory environment, fintech can only survive in the U.S. with the active collaboration of banks, but federal regulators don\u2019t want banks to partner with fintech companies. What can be done?","See also: In Lejilex vs. SEC, Crypto Goes on Offense in the Courts | Opinion","Only Congress can solve these puzzles. State legislators have been active on both fronts, designing bespoke regulatory frameworks for crypto, like the BitLicense in New York or the Digital Financial Assets Law in California, and fintech, like the special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter in Wyoming","But none of these state laws and regimes relieve state-compliant institutions from facing troubles at the federal level. Just ask Coinbase, which holds a BitLicense but is being sued by the SEC \u201Cfor operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency,\u201D or Custodia, a chartered SPDI that wasn\u2019t allowed to hold a Fed master account and thus cannot directly offer basic payment services.","Congress must act to keep financial innovation alive. Enacting tailored licensing and regulatory federal frameworks for crypto and fintech is crucial for holding the U.S. capital and financial markets sound, competitive, and inclusive. To paraphrase Heller, crypto and fintech companies should embrace the idea that they\u2019re \u201Cgoing to live forever or die in the attempt.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marcelo M.
