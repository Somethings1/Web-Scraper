As per the anouncement, Worldcoin has now integrated with Okta and is launching World ID, the project\u2019s identity protocol.","With World ID, users will be able to verify their identities with the use of custom-built hardware that leverages biometrics. The hardware is called the Orbs, and will first be available in Berlin, before expanding throughout the country.","Orbs come with iris scanners and then use the data to create unique cryptographic identities. Data processing happens in real time, it was said, and the generated digital key is stored on the device itself.","As part of its integration with Okta, there is now an option to \u201CSign in with Worldcoin\u201D on the Auth0 marketplace, allowing developers to add the new feature to their apps and websites.","The new sign-in flow is not only simple but also more robust in terms of privacy, it was said on the Worldcoin blog. ","By signing in with Worldcoin, a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is generated on the user\u2019s device, which confirms their identity without revealing sensitive, personally identifiable information. ","As the device generates a new ZKP every time a user logs in, it\u2019s impossible to track accounts on different platforms to the same individual.","World ID is also expected to reduce bot traffic, which is a major pain point for advertisers. Bot traffic makes up the majority of internet traffic these days, and is often abused in digital ad fraud. ","This type of fraud, the Worldcoin blog further stated, is expected to grow into a $100 billion industry this year.","With World ID, it should be easier to determine whether the traffic is coming from an actual human or not, it was said.","As one of the world\u2019s largest identity and access management software companies out there, Okta claims to service millions of users.","____","\u2013 Will Worldcoin Be the Next Cryptocurrency to Explode As AI Crypto Coins yPredict, Launchpad, AiDoge Explode\n\u2013 Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin Introduces App for Eyeball-Scanning Crypto Project\n\n\u2013 What is Blockchain Technology?\n\u2013 What is a Smart Contract?"],"entity":[{"type":"Eyeball","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Okta","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Germany","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$100 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Launchpad","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Berlin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Germany","Privacy"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
