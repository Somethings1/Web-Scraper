It featured discussions centered around the implementation and implications of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in Hong Kong.","The HKEX launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on April 30, marking the first spot virtual asset ETFs in Asia.","David Bailey, co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, emphasized the event\u2019s role in bridging Hong Kong\u2019s emerging crypto economy with the mainland\u2019s restrictive regulatory environment.","\u201CI think the ETFs were kind of an admission that Bitcoin is here to stay,\u201D said Bailey. \u201CThere\u2019s no way that Hong Kong just accidentally stumbled into launching an ETF \u2026 It wasn\u2019t random.\u201D","Bailey also stated that the local government has shown strong support for the sector and the company is already considering returning to the SAR.

He views this as a potential way to mitigate the market downturn in China.","\u201CWhat I\u2019m optimistic about is, with these rules and these regulations now in place, Hong Kong actually may find a way to be this bridge for China to Bitcoin and to the greater crypto ecosystem in a way that\u2019s more safe, more controlled or regulated,\u201D said Gagnon.","\u201CI hope that there\u2019s going to be more pathways into mainland China,\u201D Gagnon added."],"entity":[{"type":"Bailey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ben Gagnon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gagnon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SAR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"David Bailey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin Magazine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South China Morning Post","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","China","Hong Kong"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
