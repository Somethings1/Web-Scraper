The move could help boost the demand for similar works in the future.","The artwork was created by British artist Ben Gentilli, who goes by the alias Robert Alice as part of a project he launched in 2019.","Per information provided by the auction house, the artwork is accompanied by an OpenDime hardware key. The physical element of the work was crafted using 24-carat gold leaf, suspended pigment and acrylic on canvas laid down on a panel.","Like the 20 other pieces in the collection, Block 21 is engraved with 322,048 digits of original Bitcoin code. In total, 40 pieces are set to be released, featuring the cryptoasset\u2019s roughly 12.3 million-digit code.","Gentilli wrote in a manifesto on his project\u2019s website,","\u201CPortraits of a Mind is one artist\u2019s response to the inevitability of digital degradation, to the idea of this founding code as a now-historic text, and to the story of Bitcoin. A digital fingerprint carved out of paint, Portraits of a Mind is a reflection on the nature of identity in our newly decentralized age.\u201D","The London-based artist claimed that he was also motivated by the mysterious founder of Bitcoin. Gentilli added,","\u201CA portrait of Satoshi Nakamoto, the work explores the politics and aesthetics of open source code and its relationship to identity and truth. The work not only examines the founding code for traces of Nakamoto\u2019s identity, but also for the identity of Bitcoin itself.\u201D","The artist has high hopes for the next installment in his series \u2013 with Block 22 (42.435948째 N, -71.154904째 E) also slated to go under the hammer in the near future.\n___\nLearn more:\nNew Initiative Rewards Artists For Bitcoin Street Art\nArt + Crypto Tale Takes New Twist as Artist Tokenizes His Output\n\u2018Largest Collaboration of Crypto Artists in History\u2019 is Set for Launch"],"entity":[{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ben Gentilli","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Largest Collaboration of Crypto Artists","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nakamoto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Robert Alice","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Art","Bitcoin","Blockchain","Satoshi Nakamoto"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
