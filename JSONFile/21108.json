The next 6-12 months are likely to see a massive rally as investors flee stock, bond, and real estate markets \u2013 for blockchain.\u201D","The well-known crypto asset manager added that the bitcoin price is now 56% below an 11-year-old exponential growth trend on the bitcoin chart. \u201CThe markets have rarely been so cheap relative to the trend,\u201D he said.","Morehead also said in his newsletter that we are entering a period of rising rates, and that this is something that will probably continue \u201Cfor years,\u201D with the 10-year US treasury rate predicted by the firm to triple.","The investor noted that the median forecast for the peak in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Funds Rate is 2.1%.","\u201CThat\u2019s below where they were just before the pandemic, even though the economy is massively overheated compared with two years ago,\u201D Morehead said, while reminding readers that \u201Cno working-age person in America has invested in a rising rate environment.\u201D","This latest prediction from Pantera that the crypto market bottom is behind us comes after the firm in early February delivered an outlook that turned out to be spot on.","On February 1, the firm\u2019s co-chief investment officer Joey Krug predicted in a call with investors that the correlation between bitcoin and traditional financial markets would break this spring.","\u201CAnd so we think over the next number of weeks, crypto is basically going to decouple from traditional markets and begin to trade on its own again,\u201D Krug said at the time, adding that he expected a move higher for crypto \u201Crelatively quickly.\u201D","So far, that prediction has turned out correct, with the BTC price up more than 20% since the comments were made on February 1. The broad-based S&P 500 stock index, meanwhile, is up by a mere 1% over the same time period.","Notably, Pantera is not the only firm that sees an upside from the current price levels in the crypto market.","According to crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale, the current consolidation pattern for bitcoin above the USD 46,000 level is \u201Ckey\u201D for bullish continuation towards the USD 50,000, a major milestone for the bitcoin price.","\u201CWhile we did see rejection around USD 48,000, as long as BTC remains above USD 46,000 bulls can be hopeful of another move. If we lose these levels in the new week, another test of the low USD 40Ks is the probable scenario,\u201D DiPasquale said in emailed comments on Tuesday.","Another data point to may provide clues as to how investors are positioning themselves for a possible crypto market rally is the level of inflows to bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).","According to crypto analytics provider Glassnode, inflows into Canadian bitcoin ETFs hit its highest level ever, with BTC 6,594 added to the ETFs since January this year.","Bitcoin ETFs in Canada are often paid attention to because the country \u2013 unlike the US \u2013 has approved several ETFs backed by actual bitcoin rather than bitcoin futures contracts.","Among the many funds listed in Canada, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF saw the biggest increase in holdings during the period with a net growth of 18.7% to reach BTC 35,000. The increase came despite \u201Ca storm of macro and geopolitical headwinds,\u201D Glassnode said in a report on Monday.","At press time (11:33 UTC) on Tuesday, BTC stood at USD 46,672. The coin is up 1.1% for the past 24 hours and down 0.7% for the past 7 days.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Weekend Crypto Trading Offers Clues to Stock Investors as Tesla Faces Shanghai Lockdown\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Try to Reverse Losses, but Short-Term Hurdles Remain While Surveys Send Positive Signs\n\n\u2013 Neutrino USD Loses Peg as WAVES Dives, But Developer Claims It Will be \u2018Absolutely Fine Very Soon\u2019\n\u2013 Bitcoin Breaks Key Resistance, Crosses USD 47K as Terra Buys More BTC, Liquidations Soar\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Rally Gets Support From \u2018Watershed\u2019 Executive Order, Rising Stock Market\n\u2013 Fed Raises Interest Rate by 25 Basis Points in First Rate Hike Since 2018\n\n\u2013 Crypto Market Tries to Recover With Ukraine Negotiations in Focus; Gold & Commodities Rise\n\u2013 Pandemic Has Accelerated Crypto Market\u2019s Transformation Into Commodity Market \u2013 Research\n\n\u2013 IMF Economists: Crypto Is Not on the Fringe Anymore, Correlation with Stocks Poses Risks\n\u2013 Most Cryptos Correlated with Stocks, Not with Gold \u2013 Analysts"],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BitBull Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"18.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"56%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"\u2013 Weekend Crypto Trading Offers Clues to Stock Investors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Purpose Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Rate Hike Since 2018\n\n\u2013 Crypto Market Tries to Recover With Ukraine Negotiations in Focus; Gold & Commodities Rise\n\u2013 Pandemic Has Accelerated Crypto Market","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DiPasquale","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Morehead","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pantera","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"spring","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Krug","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tesla Faces Shanghai Lockdown\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Try","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"-50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Rising Stock Market\n\u2013 Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Joe DiPasquale","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Liquidations Soar\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Rally","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Joey Krug","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fringe Anymore","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pantera Capital\u2019s CEO Dan Morehead","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Short","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Neutrino USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Glassnode","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Bitcoin","Canada","ETF","Federal Reserve","Forecast","Market","Stocks","USA"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
