Modern cryptography is truly amazing.","\u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 29, 2024","","\u201CModern cryptography is truly amazing,\u201D he said.","In October 2023, Vitalik Buterin expressed concerns about Worldcoin, especially its fundamental mechanism that verifies human identity via iris scanning. He discussed its \u201Cdigital passport\u201D that differentiates humans from AI but raised privacy and accessibility issues.","Buterin noted the system\u2019s potential to solve \u201Canti-spam and anti-concentration-of-power problems,\u201D yet he cautioned, \u201CIf proof of personhood is not solved, decentralized governance becomes much easier to capture by very wealthy actors, including hostile governments.\u201D","His primary worry was the extensive data collected through iris scanning, potentially revealing personal details like sex, ethnicity, and medical conditions.","Regarding Worldcoin\u2019s global accessibility, Buterin was skeptical, pointing out, \u201CEven with much higher-scale distributed manufacturing, it would be hard to get to a world where there\u2019s an Orb within five kilometers of everyone.\u201D","Worldcoin\u2019s biometric data collection practices have recently faced regulatory actions globally.","In Portugal, the National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) temporarily halted Worldcoin for 90 days on March 26, due to concerns over collecting iris and facial scans without adequate consent, particularly from minors.","Similarly, in Spain, the Data Protection Agency (AEPD) issued a three-month ban on Worldcoin\u2019s data collection starting March 6, citing similar issues. Legal appeals by Worldcoin were rejected by a local court, affirming the AEPD\u2019s decision.","These instances reflect a growing scrutiny of Worldcoin by regulators in different jurisdictions, including Hong Kong and Kenya, where concerns over privacy risks and biometric data collection have led to investigations and restrictions on the platform\u2019s activities."],"entity":[{"type":"Kenya","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Portugal","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"National Data Protection Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"IMO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Spain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Data Protection Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 29, 2024","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Sam Altman","Vitalik Buterin","Worldcoin"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
