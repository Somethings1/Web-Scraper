Blockchain company and leading Solana validator Laine tweeted: \u201CIt is not clear yet whether a recovery is possible without a coordinated cluster restart.\u201D","Engineers are investigating and identifying a possible remediation, it is not clear yet whether a recovery is possible without a coordinated cluster restart.","Consensus on the last optimistic slot has been reached at 246464040, validators are on standby for next steps as needed","\u2014 Laine ‚ù§Ô∏è stakewiz.com (@laine_sa_) February 6, 2024","","According to a follow-up tweet by Laine, engineers were investigating the problem of building a patch.

While chart data suggests the coin has found strong support at this level, the outage could mean SOL holders haven\u2019t yet seen the end.","Based on historical data, SOL could bottom to previous support levels of around $0.87.","It\u2019s unlikely to spiral down to its 2023 low of around $0.79, though. This previous bottom was part of a market-wide rout, catalyzed when JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakomoto could one day return and \u201Cerase\u201D the cryptocurrency.","In short, SOL fans can probably expect more losses in the short-term, but the coin\u2019s current price action is due to a technical fault, rather than any threats to the network or its reputability.","Crypto\u2019s leaders by market cap have yet to experience anything like their heady growth in the pandemic era. Now that regulators have shone their headlamps on the industry after scandals by Terra and FTX, the altcoin sector has potentially more room for growth.","ERC-20 token Sponge (SPONGE) hit exchanges last April and posted an immediate rally of 150%.
