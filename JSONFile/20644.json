The country has also recently detained two Binance executives charged with money laundering and tax evasion.","According to CoinTelegraph\u2019s interview with Lucky Uwakwe, Chair of Nigeria\u2019s Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee (BICCoN), the upcoming meeting between the Nigerian SEC and crypto exchanges will primarily focus on addressing regulatory concerns within the country\u2019s cryptocurrency sector.","Spearheaded by Emomotimi Agama, the newly appointed Nigerian SEC Director General, the meeting will take place on May 6 and is open to key players in Nigeria\u2019s crypto industry, including virtual asset service providers (VASPS), wallet providers, and crypto exchange platforms.","NIGERIAN SEC TO MEET WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGES AMID ONGOING REGULATORY BATTLE","\u2013 Emomotimi Agama, the new Director General of the Nigerian SEC, will meet with both local and foreign crypto CEXs at a roundtable event on May 6th.","\u2013 The event is being organized by The

the regulatory terrain and strive toward fostering an environment conducive to innovation and growth within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector,\u201D Uwakwe told CoinTelegraph.","News of the meeting comes during troubling economic times for the country, with some blame being pinned on cryptocurrencies.","In February, Nigeria\u2019s government reportedly banned its citizens\u2019 access to several crypto exchanges, effectively accusing Binance of fixing the rate of the country\u2019s currency, naira.","Nigerian Central Bank Governor Olayemi Cardoso accused Binance of shuffling an estimated $26 billion worth of illicit funds through its Nigerian branch last year.","''in the case of Binance, In the last one year, 26 billion dollars has passed through Binance Nigeria from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.''","CBN Governor, Olayemi Cardoso pic.twitter.com\/A6O2wlsY5M","\u2014 Channels Television (@channelstv) February 27, 2024","","\u201CWe are concerned that certain practices that go on that indicate illicit flows through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201D Cardoso said. \u201CIn the case of Binance, $26 billion has passed through Binance Nigeria from sources and users we cannot adequately identify.\u201D","That same month, the country detained two Binance executives, Nadeem Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan, before charging them with money laundering and tax evasion.","Anjarwalla was arrested just over a week ago, nearly 3,000 miles away in Kenya, after fleeing shortly after his arrest.","By March, the country had demanded $10 billion in compensation from the crypto exchange, with Binance discontinuing all services in the African nation.","Just last month, its inflation rate soared to a near 30-year record of 33% as the government shifted its blame toward cryptocurrencies as the cause of the crash.","Meanwhile, a Nigerian court pushed back Anjarwalla and Gambaryan\u2019s money laundering trial to May 17 after a lawyer for Binance claimed he was never given necessary proof-of-evidence documents needed for his defense.","While questions surrounding the legitimacy of the arrest remain ongoing, the country\u2019s stringent crackdown on crypto may spell doom for the two Binance executives.Â ","Next week\u2019s meeting between the Nigerian SEC and crypto stakeholders may offer insights into the future direction of the country\u2019s cryptocurrency policies."],"entity":[{"type":"Olayemi
