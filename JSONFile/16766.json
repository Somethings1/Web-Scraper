For instance, if a user loses the keys to their crypto account, they could lose access to their crypto holdings forever. In the face of this and other potential pitfalls, it\u2019s vastly easier to lose your money in crypto than in traditional banking.","This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk\u2019s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum\u2019s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.","Blockchain developers increasingly recognize that human error is an inevitability, meaning it will be difficult to push crypto into the mainstream without fail-safes and better ease of use. One of those innovations is a concept called \u201CAccount Abstraction.\u201D","Account Abstraction (AA) aims to use smart contracts to execute crypto transactions, by creating certain validity rules. With AA, users won\u2019t need to sign off on every transaction with one\u2019s private keys.","\u201CWe're going to be at a point in the future where using an Ethereum account, it's going to be just as simple as using a bank,\u201D said Kristof Gazso, a co-author for an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) on AA. \u201CPeople won't have to make that trade off of like, \u2018Hey, you know, I like decentralization, but also, it's a pain in the ass to use Ethereum.\u2019\u201D","Ultimately, through AA, developers want to make Ethereum as usable as a traditional fiat bank account, so users can make transactions more easily, program automatic bill payments and more.","But before understanding how AA could change the nature of how one may use crypto, it's important to understand how Ethereum transactions operate today.","On Ethereum, users have the ability to create two types of accounts: External Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts (CA). The two account types differ in terms of how they initiate transactions over Ethereum\u2019s network.","EOA\u2019s, the typical account-type for Ethereum users, are the type of account you use if you have used a wallet provider such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.","With an EOA, users are given a pair of keys: a public and a private key. Anyone can send funds to an EOA using its public key. But only the account\u2019s owner \u2013 whoever has access to the account\u2019s private key, which should be kept secret \u2013 can actually initiate transactions from the account.","CAs, better known as \u201Csmart contracts,\u201D are like mini computer programs that live on the Ethereum network. These accounts are controlled by code \u2013 not private keys \u2013 but they cannot initiate transactions themselves; an EOA needs to send a transaction (which you can think of like a message or instruction) to a CA in order for it to make transactions of its own.","Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet: What Is a Crypto Wallet and How to Use It","The problem with EOAs comes down to human error. \u201COne key has complete admin control over your account,\u201D said Gazso, the co-author of the EIP 4337. \u201CIf you lose it, too bad, you've lost all control over your account forever.\u201D","If you lose a private key to an EOA account, there is no help desk or key recovery process (like a \u201Cpassword reset\u201D button) that can help you regain access to your funds.","\u201CHumans are the biggest security flaw in Ethereum account management,\u201D Gazso added. While there\u2019s no concrete data on how much ETH is lost due to forgotten keys, Bitcoin accounts use a similar private key system to that on Ethereum. According to a Chainalysis report, up to 23% of all bitcoins in circulation (or around 3.79 million BTC) could be lost forever because of forgotten keys.","And forgotten keys aren't the only problem. If someone (think, hackers) gets their hands on a person\u2019s private key, they gain complete control over that person\u2019s funds.","Account Abstraction addresses the shortcomings of EOAs by merging them with CAs \u2013 allowing people to create user accounts with built-in fail-safe mechanisms and other special features for verifying transactions.","As Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin described in a 2021 blog post, \u201Cinstead of [smart contract code] just being used to implement the logic of applications, it would also be used to implement the verification logic (nonces, signatures\u2026) of individual users\u2019 wallets\u201D","Under account abstraction, user accounts could be programmed to include social recovery systems where several people \u2013 each with a key of their own \u2013 have the ability to return an account to its owner should the owner lose access to the private key.","One could also create \u201Cmultisig wallets\u201D that hand account ownership over to a group \u2013 requiring multiple different parties to sign off on transactions as a sort of extra layer of security.","Accounts under AA could also avoid some of the other hard-coded limitations of EOAs. They could, for instance, define how users pay gas fees. Currently, under EOAs on Ethereum, users have to pay gas in ether (ETH). But with AA one can choose to use a different cryptocurrency to pay gas with (like DOGE), or you can assign someone else (like a parent or friend) to pay gas fees.","All of these systems are possible to implement today using CAs, but with a significant degree of complexity and overhead (i.e., gas costs) due to the requirement that all transactions are initiated by an EOA.","There are a bunch of proposals that aim to add AA to Ethereum, with the most prominent being EIP-4337. \u201CIt really is the first proposal which achieves Account Abstraction without requiring a hard fork,\u201D Gazso said.","The key advantage of EIP-4337 is that implementing it won\u2019t require any changes to Ethereum\u2019s core protocol. The proposal would just add a new account abstraction layer atop Ethereum\u2019s core protocol \u2013 enabling wallet providers to create user-owned accounts that use smart contracts to set the rules for initiating transactions.","So if all these tools are currently available, why isn\u2019t account abstraction more widespread?","The answer to that is momentum. It\u2019s obviously not easy to build a new wallet, launch it and ship it to people. \u201CConvincing people to try out new technology, new wallets, is a very difficult task,\u201D Gazso added. That is why people who do initially start their crypto journey turn to something that has been around longer or that has been battle-tested, like a MetaMask wallet.","So finding people to implement these new technologies seems to be the biggest bottleneck for account abstraction. But the tide for that seems to be changing.","Some layer 2s on Ethereum are leading the way to natively integrate AA. StarkWare, the company behind the StarkNet blockchain, is already live with Account Abstraction. Eli Ben-Sasson, the co-founder and president of StarkWare, told CoinDesk that Account Abstraction could be used in the future to \u201Cuse your facial recognition or biometrics to basically authorize [crypto] payments,\u201D sort of like how FaceID can activate credit card payments for iPhone users. \u201CThe infrastructure for doing this is now possible on Starknet,\u201D Ben-Sasson added.","Last month, Visa also announced its proposal to eventually use Account Abstraction to deploy automatic payments with StarkNet infrastructure. This would emulate automatic payments in a bank account to pay bills, except now it could be done on the blockchain.","Read more: Visa Proposes Automatic Payments Using Ethereum Layer 2 System StarkNet","Other firms, such as Gnosis Chain, are looking to integrate Account Abstraction into their infrastructure. Gnosis Chain co-founder Stefan George told CoinDesk: \u201CSlowly, interest in AA is increasing as more and more developers and users become aware of the potential.\u201D","Gazso reiterated that 2023 will be \u201Cthe year for Account Abstraction,\u201D noting that it is currently one of the most widely discussed topics in the ecosystem."],"entity":[{"type":"4337","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Wallet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stefan George","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"23%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ben","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eli Ben-Sasson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"EOA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sasson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kristof Gazso","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gazso","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gnosis Chain","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ups","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Valid Points","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Valid Points","Newsletters","Ethereum","Staking","Developers","Censorship","centralization","Devcon","The Protocol"],"authors":["Margaux Nijkerk"]}
