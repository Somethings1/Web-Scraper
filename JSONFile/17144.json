NFTs are unique digital collectibles that are connected to virtual or physical content. They serve as evidence of ownership for various items such as images, videos, artwork, or text fragments.","According to Christopher Farmer, a senior managing director at consultancy Teneo, it was announced in February that certain NFTs previously held by the bankrupt Singaporean crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) would be made available for sale.","This was part of efforts to retrieve funds for its creditors.","Plans for the auction were revealed in April through a press release:","Sotheby\u2019s is preparing to host an auction for a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) seized from now-defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.","#AuctionUpdate: One of the most important works of post-blockchain generative art,@dmitricherniak\u2019s Ringers #879 (The Goose) has just sold for $6.2 million, making it the 2nd highest generative art sale of all time. #SothebysGRAILS https:\/\/t.co\/dKyqxGbAIZ pic.twitter.com\/zkxoP21M9e","Based on data from blockchain tracker DappRadar, the hedge fund had spent $15.5 million worth of crypto to acquire the 37 NFTs in several rounds of purchases between July and August 2021.","Among the collection of artworks by Canadian artist Dimitri Cherniak, one of the most valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) owned by the hedge fund was \u201CThe Goose.\u201D It was featured as Ringer #879 in a series of 1,000 computer-generated abstract images.","Reportedly, Ringer #879 sold for $6.2 million, which according to DappRadar data, is $0.3 million higher than what 3AC had spent acquiring it in August 2021.","Notably, another seven of 3AC-owned NFTs had already sold in May, roughly one month before the Ringer #879 sale. These seven fetched a staggering $2.5 million at the Sotheby\u2019s auction.","According to Michael Bouhanna, head of digital art and NFTs at Sotheby, the margin indicated a growing interest in NFTs. In his words:","We see a growing interest and more non-crypto, non-NFT collectors starting to really understand the quality and why it\u2019s interesting.","Bouhanna explained the existence of the NFTs at the auction, saying that while they only existed in digital form, freely available for public viewing online, physical print copies accompanied most of the items. Buyers could display these physical copies.","It is worth mentioning that crypto prices surged in 2021 in tandem with the NFT boom. This caused a surge in crypto prices as technology enthusiasts wagered on digital assets becoming lucrative across online virtual marketplaces.","However, the intense speculative craze surrounding NFTs has diminished significantly, with sales declining from a peak of approximately $5.7 billion in January 2022 to around $675 million in May 2023.","Apart from the waning hype, the decline in NFT sales can also be attributed to a general sense of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) prevalent in the market. This atmosphere of uncertainty has made market participants more cautious and risk-averse."],"entity":[{"type":"Sotheby\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sotheby","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$5.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Christopher Farmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$675 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Three Arrows Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Bouhanna","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$6.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dimitri Cherniak","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$0.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Luna","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Teneo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$15.5 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["NFT","NFTs","Non-fungible tokens","Three Arrows Capital"],"authors":["Lockridge Okoth"]}
