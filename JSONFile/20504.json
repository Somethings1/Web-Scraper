Meanwhile, today, the Bank of England (BoE) and Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury announced the joint creation of a new Taskforce to coordinate work on the potential UK CBDC.","The Bahamas and Cambodia secured top positions on the podium as their respective CBDC projects are live, while China is currently testing its digital yuan project. More than 88% of the world\u2019s CBDC projects that are currently in the pilot or production phase use blockchain technology, according to data from the report, which was obtained by Bloomberg.","\u201CCBDCs will contribute significantly to the modernization of the international monetary landscape, hand-in-hand with reconfiguration in both payment and financial infrastructure,\u201D according to PwC, who estimates that this new type of money will generate new opportunities for further digitization in both corporates and financial institutions.","Within the field of interbank or wholesale projects, Thailand and Hong Kong were tied for the top spot, followed by Singapore, Canada, and the UK, PwC said.","Meanwhile, the BoE and the Treasury, alongside the Taskforce launched:","The central bank also said it will establish a CBDC Unit that will lead its internal exploration around CBDC and external engagement on CBDC.","The BoE and the Treasury stressed that they have not yet made a decision on whether to introduce a CBDC in the UK, and they \u201Cwill engage widely with stakeholders on the benefits, risks and practicalities of doing so.\u201D","Per the announcement, a CBDC would be a new form of digital money issued by the Bank of England and for use by households and businesses. \u201CIt would exist alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them,\u201D they said.","Meanwhile, per the PwC report, other large economies, such as the US and the European Union, have lagged behind, but recent statements by decision-makers indicate that the European and American CBDC projects could gain traction amid increasing pressure from China and its digital yuan initiative.","Also, motivations behind the countries\u2019 respective CBDC efforts vary, with some countries declaring they want to use such currencies to increase their populations\u2019 financial inclusion, and others aiming to use them as a source of enhanced control over their monetary policies.","As reported, speaking at a panel discussion held last March during the annual BIS Innovation Summit, an event hosted by the Bank for International Settlements, Changchun Mu, Director-General of the Digital Currency Institute of the People\u2019s Bank of China, admitted that Chinese decision-makers largely perceive cryptocurrencies as a threat to the country\u2019s monetary policy. This view has stimulated work on the roll-out of a Chinese CBDC, he said.","At the same panel, John A. Rolle, Governor of the Central Bank of The Bahamas, said that while his nation has very high levels of financial inclusion by global standards, populations inhabiting some of its smaller islands are deprived of access to banking services. This encouraged the authorities to launch the Bahamian CBDC in 2019, he said.\n____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Chinese Central Bank Calls Bitcoin an \u2018Investment Alternative\u2019\n\u2013 First or Not, The Bahamas Trumps Leading Economies with CBDC Rollout\n\u2013 Architect of Launched Cambodian CBDC Also Working with \u2018Other Countries\u2019\n\u2013 Prepare For \u2018Uncertain Future of Money\u2019 \u2013 US Intelligence Center\n\u2013 Swedish Central Bank Wants \u2018Market Actors\u2019 to Join Next Stage of CBDC Pilot\n\u2013 Japanese Central Bank Starts Testing on Digital Yen\n\u2013 If a CBDC Is an \u2018Instrument of Control,\u2019 It\u2019ll Fail \u2013 Expert\n\u2013 Economists: CBDCs to \u2018Flop\u2019 if They Aren\u2019t Designed as Stores of Value\n\u2013 2021 Trends in CBDCs: More Pilots, Maybe Some Launches, But Not For Retail\n\u2013 Post-COVID-19, Bitcoin & Co May Help UK Escape from Economic Funk"],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"88%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bank for International Settlements","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Currency Institute of the People\u2019s Bank of China","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank of England (BoE","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John A.
