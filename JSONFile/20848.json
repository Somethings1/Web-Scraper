And although there is some confusion as to whether it is indeed the world\u2019s very first CBDC or not, the Caribbean nation can certainly claim to have beaten scores of major world economies to the punch \u2013 releasing a central bank token months if not years ahead of others who are still humming and hawing over whether they will even consider issuing a CBDC.","The rollout was announced on the Sand Dollar\u2019s official Facebook page, operated by the Central Bank of the Bahamas.","The bank wrote,","\u201C[The] Central Bank of The Bahamas\u2019 digital dollar is available nationwide.\u201D","It also provided telephone numbers and social media links, encouraging citizens and businesses to get in touch with any questions they have about the new token.","On Twitter, the central bank used the hashtag \u201C#SandDollarOnTheMove.\u201D","Although bank-issued digital currencies are already in existence in some nations, the Sand Dollar appears to be the world\u2019s first to roll out nationwide \u2013 although other states may dispute this claim.","CBDC projects are already in advanced pilot or limited rollout stages in China and Thailand, with the latter\u2019s central bank claiming that business transactions are already being conducted in its token.","A \u201Cquasi\u201D CBDC is also in operation in Cambodia, whose central bank was slated to launch a token in conjunction with a Japanese blockchain firm sometime this year.","Some African nations also claim to be at various stages of CBDC rollout.","But whether the Bahamas\u2019 Sand Dollar is the first CBDC or not may ultimately be immaterial. The central bank may already have its sights set on more lucrative prizes than a non-existent first-place trophy \u2013 with bank officials last week claiming they were in talks with international parties over the use of the Sand Dollar on the international stage.\n___","Learn more:\nWhile China Is Already Testing CBDC, US\u2019s Goal Is \u2018To Get It Right\u2019\nECB Sends Another Confirmation of A \u2018Global Currency War\u2019\nA Reality Check is Needed at This Stage of CBDC Development \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nHow CBDCs Might Change Our Daily Payments"],"entity":[{"type":"Central Bank of the Bahamas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Caribbean","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Thailand","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ECB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bahamas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reality Check","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank of The Bahamas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cambodia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CBDC Development \u2013 Deutsche Bank\nHow CBDCs Might Change Our Daily Payments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","CBDC","Central Bank"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
