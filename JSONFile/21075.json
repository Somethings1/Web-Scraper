The 2024 Republican frontrunner has once again promised against the creation of a CBDC \u201Cto protect Americans from government tyranny.\u201D","Speaking in Portsmouth, New Hampshire Trump defined CBDCs as a \u201Cdangerous threat to freedom.\u201D Pro-crypto former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently dropped out of his campaign, was also present on stage, officially endorsing Trump.","Trump says he will prevent implementation of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) pic.twitter.com\/vheJDn2HBg","\u2014 Bertman (@manofbert) January 18, 2024","","Trump also promised that he would stop the digital Dollar from coming to America. \u201CSuch a currency would give the federal government absolute control over your money. They could take your money, and you wouldn\u2019t even know it was gone.\u201D","Donald Trump has a history of criticizing Bitcoin and other cryptos. In July 2019, he stressed, \u201CI am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.\u201D He said that these asset classes can \u201Cfacilitate unlawful behavior\u201D like drug trade.","That said, an official filing that circulated in October 2023 revealed that Trump holds between $250,000 to $500,000 in digital assets. A previous disclosure also noted that the ex-President held a majority of assets in Ethereum.","Additionally, Trump has also introduced three non-fungible tokens (NFTs) since leaving office. The demand for his NFTs skyrocketed, boosting sales by a jaw-dropping 650% in just a few days, said a Tweet.","CBDCs haven\u2019t scored well in the eyes of many politicians. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stood firm against CBDCs. He said in May 2023, \u201CIf CBDCs are the encroachment on our civil liberties that the majority of people believe they are, we don\u2019t have time to wait.\u201D He said that CBDCs must be stopped before the Feds try to get it.","Further, the Florida Blockchain Association helped in drafting the state\u2019s anti-CBDC bill, which was passed in Florida\u2019s Senate recently.","Bank of America said in November that though CBDCs are growing globally, a digital Dollar is unlikely to launch anytime soon. \u201CThe Federal Reserve (Fed) continues to pilot CBDCs but has not committed to a CBDC and will not issue one without executive branch and Congressional support,\u201D the bank wrote."],"entity":[{"type":"$250,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ron DeSantis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New Hampshire Trump","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank Digital Currencies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vivek Ramaswamy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Trump","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Florida","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"July 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Portsmouth","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bank of America","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bertman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 18, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$500,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Florida Blockchain Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"650%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Federal Reserve (Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","Donald Trump","USA"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
