This is when liquidity tokens are reused as collateral across numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols at the same time. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain.","\u201CRehypothecation could then result in a cascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value or is hacked or slashed due to malicious attack or a protocol error,\u201D the note said.","The increase in staking has also reduced the appeal of ether from a \u201Cyield perspective,\u201D especially given the backdrop of rising yields in traditional financial assets, the report added. The total staking yield has dropped from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to about 5.5%.","Read more: Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade Has Been \u2018Disappointing,\u2019 JPMorgan Says","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lido","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"7.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"5.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["ethererum","Ether","Shanghai upgrade","The Merge","JPMorgan","centralization","Lido"],"authors":["Will Canny"]}
