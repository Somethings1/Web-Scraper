Now the parties are delivering their closing statements. COPA\u2019s legal counsel Jonathan Hough said: \u201CFollowing the evidence in this trial, it is clearer than ever \u2013 clear beyond doubt \u2013 that Dr. Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto. He did not write the Bitcoin white paper, produce the Bitcoin code or implement the Bitcoin system.\u201D","Founded in 2020, COPA is an alliance to promote blockchain development through open access to patents. Its 33 members include Facebook parent company Meta, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s payments company Block, Bitcoin\u2019s biggest whale MicroStrategy, and centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini.","As a self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto (the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin), Craig Wright holds many blockchain-related patents and he has gone so far as to sue Bitcoin developers and companies over alleged violations of his copyright over Bitcoin\u2019s white paper.","Jack Dorsey got involved in the case early on and footed the developers and affiliated companies\u2019 legal bill through his crypto legal war chest, the Bitcoin Legal Defence Fund.","It also looks like Wright\u2019s story is unravelling. In January this year he offered COPA an out-of-court settlement, which the alliance strongly declined in a tweet.","Hard pass on that \"settlement.\"","Just like Craig Wright forges documents and doesn't quite tell the truth, his description of the settlement offer isn't quite accurate either \u2013 it comes with loopholes that would allow him to sue people all over again.","\u2014 COPA (@opencryptoorg) January 24, 2024","","Craig Wright\u2019s claims began to really unravel under cross-examination earlier this year. In early February, COPA\u2019s team called attention to the fact that many documents used in Wright\u2019s defence are intentional forgeries. Wright tried to rubbish the claim by suggesting a shady cabal of people on Reddit and across the web were conspiring to make him look bad.","Later that month, Wright claimed he destroyed hard drives containing his (\u201CSatoshi\u2019s\u201D) private keys while under the influence of sedatives.","Witness David Bridges threw a spanner in the works when he took the stand to suggest Wright could be Satoshi based on his love for Japanese things and the fact that, in the time they worked together, Wright proposed an alternative to the global SWIFT payments system.","Bridges also noted that Wright sent him several papers and documents and suggested one of these may have been Bitcoin\u2019s white paper but he didn\u2019t acknowledge it at the time because he found the gesture \u201Cvery annoying\u201D.","In what could now be his last, desperate attempt to convince everyone he is Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright released 160,000 pages of so-called evidence last month."],"entity":[{"type":"Crypto Open Patent Alliance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Legal Defence Fund","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Craig Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jonathan Hough","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Satoshi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January 24, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"David Bridges","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wright","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Craig Wright","crypto open patent alliance"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
