However, it\u2019s not the case in every country, as recent developments demonstrated.","To mine bitcoin, \u201Call you need is the internet. So you have this interesting geography arbitrage situation where bitcoin is a buyer of energy in those places where it might be curtailed otherwise. Where energy might be abundant but there\u2019s no buyer for it,\u201D Carter said. \u201CSo that was the case for instance in the southern provinces of China \u2026 where there was far too much hydropower and China hasn\u2019t done a good job at building the infrastructure to transport that to the population centers.\u201D","As reported, the BTC price rise will provide a boon for miners. And that will likely spur them on to intensify their efforts yet further in the troubled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, making use of old-fashioned coal power stations.","___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Ukraine Wants to Bolster its Budget with Nuclear-powered Crypto Mining\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Upgrade Runs Into an Obstacle as Some Miners Try To Stop It\n\u2013 Associated Gas Pilot Could Lead to Huge Boon for Russian Bitcoin Miners\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining in 2021: Growth, Consolidation, Renewables, and Regulation\n\u2013 Power-starved Abkhazians Face Internet Restrictions in Crypto Mining Crisis\n\u2013 Bitfarms Signs a Deal That Cuts Bitcoin Mining Power Costs in Half\n\u2013 Why Bitcoin\u2019s Energy Consumption May Be a Price Worth Paying"],"entity":[{"type":"Bloomberg TV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sichuan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Power Costs in Half\n\u2013 Why Bitcoin\u2019s Energy Consumption","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mongolia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Castle Island Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"September 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Russian Bitcoin Miners\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201CCambridge Centre for Alternative Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Mining\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Upgrade Runs Into","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shanxi","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nic Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Mining"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
