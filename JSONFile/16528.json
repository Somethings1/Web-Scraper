This is all at odds with what you would expect from a man who is said to hold $400m in bitcoins from his early mining efforts.","Furthermore, Nakamoto is trying to recover from prostate surgery undertaken in October 2012 and a stroke he suffered in October 2013, he stated.","Closing the statement, Nakamoto thanked people around the world \"who have offered me their support\" and asks for his privacy to be respected. \"This will be our last public statement on this matter,\" he says.","","Dorian Nakamoto official statement\/denial.
