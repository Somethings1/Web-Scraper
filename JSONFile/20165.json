This, said the Council, makes it \u201Cone of the most sustainable industries globally.\u201D","Also, it is estimated that the global Bitcoin Network\u2019s technological efficiency grew by 46% year-on-year, from 14.4 EH per gigawatt (GW) in the second quarter of 2021 to 21.1 EH per GW in the second quarter of this year.","The Bitcoin Mining Council is a voluntary forum of crypto mining companies spearheaded by MicroStrategy CEO and Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor. They said that the council\u2019s membership hashrate increased to 108 EH in Q2 2022, representing 50.5% of the global Bitcoin mining network.","\u201CIn the second quarter of 2022, the hashrate and related security of the Bitcoin Network improved by 137% year-on-year while energy usage only increased 63%,\u201D Saylor said and added:","\u201CWe observed a 46% year-on-year increase in efficiency due to advances in semiconductor technology, the rapid expansion of North American mining, the China Exodus, and the worldwide adoption of sustainable energy and modern bitcoin mining techniques.\u201D","In an accompanying briefing, Saylor also said that Bitcoin mining accounts for just 0.09% of the 34.8 billion metric tons (BMT) of carbon emissions estimated to be produced globally and consumed less than 0.15% of the global energy supply.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Efficiency Up 63% in Year, \u2018Sustainable Electricity Mix\u2019 Jumped 59% \u2013 Bitcoin Mining Council\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining in 2022: New Locations, Technologies, and Bigger Players\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining CO2 Footprint Is Below 0.08% Of Global Total\n\u2013 \u2018Bitcoin Is Being Embraced\u2019 by the Government & Regulatory Future Is \u2018Bright\u2019 \u2013 MicroStrategy\u2019s Saylor\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Step Towards PoS, Bitcoin Mining Difficulty\n\u2013 Despite the Bear Market, a Salvadoran Wants to Build a USD 200M Power Plant to Mine Bitcoin"],"entity":[{"type":"BMT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Government & Regulatory Future","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"second quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.09%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Network","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"second quarter of this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"second quarter of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"66.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"second quarter of 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"137%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"63%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Council\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"59.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD 200M Power Plant to Mine Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"0.08%","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Michael Saylor","Mining"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
