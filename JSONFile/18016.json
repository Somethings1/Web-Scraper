This protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It\u2019s not optional. It\u2019s the law.","The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that the Gemini Earn program constitutes an offer and sale of securities and that it should have been registered with the regulator. According to the SEC Chair Gary Gensler,","\u201CWe allege that Genesis and Gemini offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors. Today\u2019s charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws.\u201D","As a reminder, back in December 2020, Genesis, the parent company of which is Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group (DCG), partnered with Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss twins, to enable the exchange\u2019s customers to loan their crypto to Genesis in exchange for interest. ","In February 2021, Genesis and Gemini launched the Gemini Earn program to retail investors, where Gemini deducted an agent fee from the returns Genesis paid to Gemini Earn investors. \u201CAs alleged in the complaint, Genesis then exercised its discretion in how to use investors\u2019 crypto assets to generate revenue and pay interest to Gemini Earn investors,\u201D said the press release.","In November 2022, Genesis said Gemini Earn investors could no longer withdraw their crypto due to a lack of sufficient liquid assets as a result of the market volatility. Per the complaint, Genesis at the time held some $900 million in assets from 340,000 Gemini Earn investors. ","Gemini ended the Gemini Earn program days ago, but \u201Cas of today, the Gemini Earn retail investors have still not been able to withdraw their crypto assets,\u201D the SEC said.","Gemini\u2019s Earn program, supported by Genesis\u2019 lending activities, met the SEC\u2019s definition by including both an investment contract and a note, as the two features are part of how the SEC assesses whether an offering is a security, CNBC reported.","Per this report, citing the Commission, in the first three months of 2022, Gemini made around $2.7 million in agent fees off Earn, and over the same period, Genesis paid out $166.2 million in interest to clients, including Gemini, on $169.8 million of interest income.","In a tweet, Tyler Winklevoss called the SEC\u2019s actions \u201Ccounterproductive\u201D and claimed that Gemini has been in discussions with the SEC over the Earn program for months.","He wrote that,","\u201CDespite these ongoing conversations, the SEC chose to announce their lawsuit to the press before notifying us. Super lame. It\u2019s unfortunate that they\u2019re optimizing for political points instead of helping us advance the cause of 340,000 Earn users and other creditors. [\u2026]  We look forward to defending ourselves against this manufactured parking ticket.\u201D","2\/ As a matter of background, the Earn program was regulated by the @NYDFS and we\u2019ve been in discussions with the SEC about the Earn program for more than 17 months. They never raised the prospect of any enforcement action until AFTER Genesis paused withdrawals on November 16th."," ","Meanwhile, CNBC reported that, per the SEC officials, the possibility of a DCG or Genesis bankruptcy had no bearing on deciding whether to pursue a charge.","And the above seems not to be all the bad news coming the crypto industry\u2019s way, with the SEC stating that,","\u201CInvestigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing.\u201D","Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said that the recent collapse of crypto asset lending programs, as well as the suspension of Genesis\u2019 program, show that there is a \u201Ccritical need\u201D for platforms that are offering \u201Csecurities to retail investors\u201D to comply with the federal securities laws. ","Grewal added that, ","\u201COur investigations in this space are very much active and ongoing and we encourage anyone with information about this matter or other possible securities law violations to come forward, including under our Whistleblower Program if applicable.\u201D","The SEC\u2019s Whistleblower Program was created by Congress to provide monetary incentives for individuals to report possible violations of federal securities laws. The \u201Celigible whistleblowers\u201D can get an award between 10% and 30% of \u201Cthe monetary sanctions collected in actions brought by the SEC and related actions brought by certain other regulatory and law enforcement authorities,\u201D said the press release.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Gemini Exchange Seeks to Retrieve $900 Million from Crypto Lender Genesis\n\u2013 Crypto Brokerage Genesis Global Trading Asks for More Time to Resolve Lending Issues \u2013 What is Going On?\n\n\u2013 DCG Said to be in Talks with Creditors \u2013 Will Gemini Crypto Depositors Get Their Money Back?\n\u2013 Cameron Winklevoss Calls for DCG Board to Sack Barry Silbert"],"entity":[{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Lender Genesis\n\u2013 Crypto Brokerage Genesis Global Trading Asks","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DCG Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Genesis & Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$166.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"\u201Cbillions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gemini Trust Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$900 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gemini Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the first three months of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"LLC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Creditors \u2013 Will Gemini Crypto Depositors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Winklevoss twins","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini Earn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tyler Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$169.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gurbir S.
