Notable trends to watch include corporate involvement, Bitcoin-centric developments, and scalability across various blockchains.","","Addressing transaction speeds and costs on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks remains a priority.","Rollup projects are expected to gain prominence in 2024, offering scalable solutions. These layer 2 blockchains aggregate multiple transactions into a single off-chain batch, reducing on-chain data processing and storage, resulting in more cost-effective and faster transactions.","Among the projects expected to benefit from these developments are decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like PancakeSwap, Uniswap, and dYdX, with the latter recently passing $10 billion in trading volume.","dYdX Chain has officially passed $10 BILLION in trading volume just one month post mainnet launch ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªÂ lfggg pic.twitter.com\/KBWFnhBiZp","\u2014 dYdX (@dYdX) January 5, 2024","","","Decentralizing web-hosting and cloud-storage systems have also been identified as a key theme for 2024 by experts like ByteTrade Lab CEO Frank Hu, who recently told Cointelegraph:","\u201CDecentralizing frontends and backends is a critical issue, including when it comes to decentralized web-hosting and cloud-storage systems.\u201D","The growth of decentralized infrastructure is a response to the increasing demand for robust and secure decentralized solutions.","","Institutional investors and traditional corporations are playing a significant role in shaping crypto trends.","Coinbase\u2019s November survey revealed that 64% of institutional crypto investors plan to increase allocations in the next three years.","Among other things, corporate involvement is driving projects that offer interoperability between Web2 and Web3, making it easier for entities to transition.","","The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is set to be a significant business driver in 2024.","Anticipated variations of Bitcoin ETFs, including ETFs with built-in leverage and short ETFs (ETFs that rise in price when the underlying asset falls), are expected to enter the market, offering diverse investment opportunities.","The excitement around Bitcoin is also likely to boost its use as collateral for Bitcoin-based loans like those offered by companies such as Ledn.","The same view was echoed in an annual letter from Ledn founders Adam Reeds & Mauricio Di Bartolomeo from early January:","\u201CIn 2024, we expect even stronger growth for Ledn and our clients, on the back of imminent spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and the halving.
