Crypto asset companies have repeatedly tried to get guidance from the SEC only to be hit with enforcement actions, causing unnecessary harm to consumers,\u201D she said. ","Lummis added that it is Congress\u2019s responsibility to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework that provides clarity on what constitutes a security and what qualifies as a commodity in the crypto industry.","The SEC cannot continue ruling by enforcement. My statement on the Kraken lawsuit below: pic.twitter.com\/J3qhzU624N","\u2014 Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) November 21, 2023","","Lummis\u2019s remarks come in the wake of a recent lawsuit filed by the SEC against popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. ","The federal regulator alleged that Kraken operated as an unregistered broker, clearing agency, and dealer while commingling customer and corporate funds. ","According to the SEC, this violated federal securities laws and created significant risks for customers, with up to $33 billion in customer crypto assets mixed with the exchange\u2019s own corporate assets.","\u201CSimilarly, Kraken has held at times more than $5 billion worth of its customers\u2019 cash, and it also commingles some of its customers\u2019 cash with some of its own,\u201D the suit said. ","\u201CIn fact, Kraken has at times paid operational expenses directly from bank accounts that hold customer cash.\u201D","The SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Kraken follows similar actions taken against other crypto trading platforms, including Binance and Coinbase. ","The agency seeks a permanent ban on Kraken operating as an unregistered exchange, along with fines and the return of any ill-gotten gains. ","The latest comments from Senator Lummis come as she has been a vocal critic of the SEC. ","Just earlier this month, she expressed her concerns about the regulatory agency\u2019s actions and vowed to block one of its controversial new crypto policies.","\u201CI think the SEC is overreaching,\u201D she said.","The SEC has been pursuing aggressive measures, including lawsuits against major players like Coinbase and Binance.","One particular policy issued by the SEC in March 2022, known as \u201CStaff Accounting Bulletin 121,\u201D has caught Lummis\u2019 attention.","The policy requires financial firms holding customers\u2019 crypto assets to include them on their balance sheets while also warning investors about the risks involved in safeguarding those assets.","Lummis is actively working on multiple fronts to provide the crypto industry with more regulatory clarity in Washington.","She has co-sponsored a comprehensive piece of crypto legislation with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), which aims to outline the sector\u2019s regulatory framework.","In recent weeks, a portion of Lummis\u2019 bill addressing terrorist financing was included in the Senate\u2019s defense spending package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act.","The senator has also expressed support for the House Financial Services Committee\u2019s crypto framework, led by Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)."],"entity":[{"type":"N.Y.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"earlier this month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$33 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kirsten Gillibrand","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 21, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"National Defense","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cynthia Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Kraken","Securities and Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
