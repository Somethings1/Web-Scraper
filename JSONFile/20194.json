(FDIC), which was appointed as the bank\u2019s receiver, has estimated a loss of $54 million from its insurance fund to protect depositors. ","The collapse of Heartland came as four major US lenders failed last year, including Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and First Republic Bank.","Among these banks, the failure of Silvergate and Signature was partly related to the 2022 crypto meltdown. "],"entity":[{"type":"Joseph Otting","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elkhart","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Silvergate Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mnuchin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Shan Hanes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"42%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"New York Community Bancorp","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$54 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mnuchin)","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Steven Mnuchin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"spring of 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Silicon Valley Bank (SVB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kansas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"afternoon","content":"TIME"},{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"First Republic","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NYCB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hudson Bay Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alessandro DiNello","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 12, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"First Republic Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Signature Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Heartland Tri-State Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FDIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moody\u2019s Investors Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Otting","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Flagstar","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reverence Capital Partners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$13 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Silicon Valley Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto bank","USA"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
