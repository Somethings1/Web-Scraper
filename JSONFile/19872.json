So when the Fed does pivot, the trade-weighted dollar could really flip quite quickly and quite sharply, and that would be quite supportive for something like bitcoin.\u201D","Butterfill said that we are in the late stage of a bear market, and now we are seeing a holding pattern. Anecdotally, he said, clients are saying: \u201CI\u2019m just waiting for the Fed to pivot, and then I\u2019m buying bitcoin.\u201D","He added that now may be a good time to do some BTC shopping, saying that:","\u201CFor me, now is an interesting entry position. [\u2026] There aren\u2019t many opportunities that come along when bitcoin\u2019s on sale like it is right now.\u201D","Meanwhile, as previously reported, famous Canadian businessman and television personality Kevin O\u2019Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, argued that, once the \u2018Stablecoin Transparency Act\u2019 is passed in the US, which may happen soon after the November midterm elections, BTC could break out of the $19,000-$22,000 trading range.","At 9 UTC on Thursday morning, BTC was trading at $19,140, unchanged for a day and for a week. It\u2019s down 2% in a month and 70% in a year.","You can watch the full interview here:","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Expert Trader Peter Brandt Says 50% Chance Bitcoin Can Go to Zero\n\u2013 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD 30,000 Barrier Soon\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin and Hard Assets Will Win as Inflation Rises, Novogratz Says and Sees BTC at USD 500K\n\u2013 Crypto Winter Will End Before 2022 Is Out \u2013 Korbit"],"entity":[{"type":"Kevin O\u2019Leary","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wolf of All Streets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Scott Melker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD 500K\n\u2013 Crypto Winter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Butterfill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wonderful","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$22,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"James Butterfill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$19,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peter Brandt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital\u2019s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Federal Reserve (Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$19,140","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Federal Reserve","Forecast","Inflation","Market","USA"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
