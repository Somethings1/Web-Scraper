According to the investigation carried out by X Reviews, the breach was not due to any attacks affecting its infrastructure but instead was a result of the lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) tied to the SEC\u2019s account.","There was initial uncertainty regarding the legitimacy of the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals as the SEC website went down shortly after the announcement. The doubt was heightened by the previous hacking of the SEC\u2019s official X account. However, the website quickly came back online, confirming the authenticity of the approval for the spot Bitcoin ETFs.","In January, cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko experienced a security breach when their account fell victim to a phishing attack.","During a brief period on January 10, a phishing scam link was posted on their X account, falsely informing users of a CoinGecko token airdrop.
