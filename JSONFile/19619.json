And per Newsis, Yoon\u2019s Presidential Transition Committee has placed the creation of a Digital Asset Framework Act (literal translation) on a shortlist of 110 action points that his government will tackle in the weeks and months after he takes up the presidency.","The details of the plan include the creation of suitable \u201Cconditions\u201D for investors who wish to invest in \u201Cdigital assets\u201D with \u201Cconfidence.\u201D More importantly for big businesses, however, the committee made mention of enabling \u201Cdomestic ICOs,\u201D albeit with \u201Cissuance methods\u201D that provide \u201Csafeguards for investors.\u201D","This will be music to the ears of the likes of the SK Group, a powerful conglomerate that has already indicated that it will issue its own token via a subsidiary firm before the end of 2022. Unconfirmed reports in the country have also stated that other mega-companies (so-called chaebol firms) such as LG and Samsung may look to follow suit. Previously the likes of Kakao and a Hyundai subsidiary have had to issue their own tokens through international subsidiaries. But with the SK token \u2013 and possibly others \u2013 primarily intended for domestic use, companies are thought to prefer a domestic launch.","The proposed Digital Asset Framework Act would, the committee indicated, comprise \u201Cmeasures to protect consumers and improve transaction stability,\u201D and could extend to the policing of both ICOs and the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Further token listing regulations are also likely to be included for crypto exchanges.\n\nDomestic ICOs, under the proposed law, would be organized into a \u201Cregulatory system,\u201D where coins would be classified as \u201Csecurity type\u201D and \u201Cnon-security type\u201D tokens, with a government-appointed body ruling on matters such as the utility nature of a token and whether it was intended for use in the payments and settlements markets.","\u201CSecurity type\u201D coins would need to issued in accordance with the terms of the Capital Market Act, which governs the issuance of conventional securities, and includes a number of \u201Csafeguards for investors.\u201D","Yoon\u2019s team has indicated that if necessary, the new government will create a preliminary financial regulatory sandbox.","\u201CNon-security type\u201D coins, meanwhile, would need to be issued within a system that ensures that listing and \u201Cunfair trading prevention\u201D measures are adhered to.","An official from the committee was quoted as stating that \u201Cintroducing an insurance system against hacks and system errors\u201D was paramount.","South Korean media outlets have also reported that Yoon\u2019s team is adamant that the nation\u2019s forthcoming crypto tax law is postponed until legislation aimed at protecting consumers comes into force. Depending on the speed of this legislative rollout and promulgation dates, that could well mean the tax is delayed until 2024, with an eleventh-hour cross-party consensus in the National Assembly last year already delaying the start of crypto taxation until at least 2023.","Yoon has previously spoken of raising the threshold for capital gains levies on crypto-related earnings to grant crypto traders parity with KOSDAQ market stock traders.\n___\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin Maintains Dominance Despite Massive Proliferation of Altcoins\n\u2013 Web 3.0 Is Coming, and Crypto Will Be Essential to It\n\n\u2013 South Korea\u2019s Biggest Neobank Reportedly on Verge of Crypto exchange Banking Deal\n\u2013 South Korean Crypto Exchanges Resume Service as Usual after Travel Rule Breakthrough"],"entity":[{"type":"SK Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hyundai","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the end of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Biggest Neobank Reportedly on Verge of Crypto exchange Banking Deal\n\u2013 South Korean Crypto Exchanges Resume Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Samsung","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elect Yoon Suk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"National Assembly","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Maintains Dominance Despite Massive Proliferation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yoon\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Yoon\u2019s Presidential Transition Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"LG","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Ban","ICO","Regulation","South Korea","Tokenization"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
