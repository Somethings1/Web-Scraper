He claimed that crypto is \u201Cbuilt primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity.\u201D","The rant generated plenty of support \u2013 as well as much recrimination and criticism from Twitter users, particularly some more vocal supporters of bitcoin (BTC). Palmer hinted that just like the pigs in George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, crypto market players have evolved into the very thing they once hoped to destroy, writing:","\u201CDespite claims of \u2018decentralization,\u2019 the cryptocurrency industry is controlled by a powerful cartel of wealthy figures who, with time, have evolved to incorporate many of the same institutions tied to the existing centralized financial system they supposedly set out to replace.\u201D","He also questioned the credibility of major crypto proponents, particularly public figures, explaining:","\u201CThe cryptocurrency industry leverages a network of shady business connections, bought influencers and pay-for-play media outlets to perpetuate a cult-like \u2018get rich quick\u2019 funnel designed to extract new money from the financially desperate and naive.\u201D","And he added the opinion that crypto takes \u201Cthe worst parts of today\u2019s capitalist system,\u201D namely \u201Ccorruption, fraud and inequality,\u201D and adds \u201Csoftware to technically limit the use of interventions\u201D (namely auditing, regulation and taxation), that \u201Cserve as protection or safety nets for the average person.\u201D","The Castle Island Ventures partner and prominent bitcoiner Nic Carter was scathing in his criticism, writing that it was \u201Chard to conceive of anything more despicable than creating a meritless clone of bitcoin with no use case other than ripping off clueless investors\u201D \u2013 and then following up by \u201Cusing that notoriety to attack and undermine the technology that made you relevant.\u201D","Other bitcoiners were keen to point out the fact that diversity does exist in the BTC space, with the BTC advocate Gigi pointing in the direction of the \u201CBitcoin Voicepaper\u201D video, which features renowned BTC enthusiasts from all over the world reading the Bitcoin White paper.","Friar Hass (aka Hass McCook), a BTC maximalist, wrote,","\u201CI agree with every single thing he said in its application to crypto. It is 100% spot on. Bitcoin is not crypto, thankfully enough.\u201D","Others suggested, though, that bitcoiners were actually keen on adoption in order to provide inclusion, rather than simply see their own holdings rise in value.","Bankers gave Palmer\u2019s comments a big round of applause, however. The Bank of Finland\u2019s Aleksi Grym opined that people did not need to take his \u201Cword for it,\u201D as Palmer\u2019s criticisms were \u201Cstraight from the horse\u2019s mouth,\u201D adding the barb:","\u201CCryptocurrencies are an ugly caricature of financial markets designed to promote greed and harmful self-interest by swindling people obsessed with money.\u201D","And while Matthew Graham, the CEO of Sino Capital, agreed with Palmer\u2019s assertion that a \u201Cpowerful cartel of wealthy figures who, with time, have evolved to incorporate many of the same institutions tied to the existing centralized financial system they supposedly set out to replace,\u201D he later added that the former DOGE supremo\u2019s \u201Cbroader screed\u201D only contained \u201Ckernels\u201D of truth and was overall \u201Cextreme and one-sided.\u201D","Another crypto advocate, \u2018Taurus159\u2019, poured scorn on Palmer\u2019s assertions, claiming that they did not apply to crypto, nor to decentralized finance (DeFi), and writing:","\u201CFor me, crypto and DeFi was and still is a vehicle for financial freedom and inclusion. But, of course, if you [created] a joke coin [like] DOGE, you wouldn\u2019t think this way.\u201D","The 8th coin by market capitalization, DOGE, is trading at USD 0.19 (at 11:15 UTC). It\u2019s down 3% in a day and about 15% in a week.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Dogecoin Fee Structure Proposal Released, Marked \u2018Important\u2019 by Elon Musk\n\u2013 Billionaire Dismisses ETH, DOGE, Backs XMR, ZEC, Says His Bank Will Accept BTC","\u2013 Dogecoin Gets Another Boost from Coinbase, Elon Musk\n\u2013 Goldman Executive Quits After Reportedly Making \u2018Millions\u2019 Off Dogecoin","\u2013 Dogecoin Needs 3 Conditions Fulfilled to Move Beyond USD 1\n\u2013 DOGE\u2019s Rally Has Revived Dogecoin Development, But For How Long?"],"entity":[{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"George Orwell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Castle Island Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bank of Finland","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk\n\u2013 Goldman Executive Quits After Reportedly Making \u2018Millions\u2019 Off Dogecoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sino Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Hass (aka Hass McCook)","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin White","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Matthew Graham","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Says His Bank Will Accept BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aleksi Grym","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dogecoin Needs 3 Conditions Fulfilled","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Palmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Billy Markus","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nic Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jackson Palmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ZEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","Community","Dogecoin","Market"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
