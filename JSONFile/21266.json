After feedback and the development of a business case from Stage 2, a decision is expected to be made on advancing to Stage 3.","To understand the rationale behind the New Zealand CBDC, one must examine the motivations and objectives outlined in the consultation paper.","According to the Consultation Paper, New Zealand\u2019s Digital Cash will be a retail-focused CBDC, primarily targeting consumers and corporate users.","We\u2019re looking at introducing a new payment option for New Zealanders \u2013 Digital Cash \u2013 an electronic version of cash, that would sit alongside but not replace physical cash.

This could adversely affect financial inclusion for those who rely on cash.","The consultation paper also included a survey showing that about 58% of consumers used physical cash as of 2023, a drop from 63% recorded in 2021, indicating a gradual reduction in fiat usage.","In addition to declining cash usage, the RBNZ wants to provide digital cash to meet needs and play a key role in financial innovation.","The consultation paper also highlighted the rapid development of innovations in crypto assets, distributed ledgers, and digital currencies issued by global technology companies.","If innovation in these sectors occurs primarily outside the New Zealand dollar, the country\u2019s fiat currency, there is a risk that citizens may opt for alternative currencies for transactions, potentially leading to a loss of monetary sovereignty.","To address these concerns, the RBNZ sees digital cash as a way to ensure there are innovative payment services in New Zealand and protect the country\u2019s monetary sovereignty.","\u201CNew Zealand\u2019s payment services have become less innovative than other countries. Digital cash would help bring down barriers to entry to the payment system,\u201D the central bank wrote in the consultation paper. \u201CDigital cash would also be a new piece of digital public infrastructure that supports digital transformation.\u201D","The RBNZ has outlined a comprehensive four-stage approach to develop and implement the New Zealand CBDC.","RBNZ has adopted a four-stage approach to creating digital cash. The first stage started in 2021 and involved publishing an issues paper that assessed the need for digital cash in New Zealand (Aotearoa). The RBNZ received over 6,000 responses.","The RBNZ is currently in the second stage of its CBDC initiative, delving into design options for Digital Cash, conducting consultations, and establishing budgetary frameworks.","The @ReserveBankofNZ has just launched a consultation on a #CBDC for New Zealand called \"digital cash\" and lays out principles and design options for New Zealand\u2019s digital cash in its new consultation paper \u2013 comments accepted until 26 July ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿https:\/\/t.co\/xLIYQEC085 pic.twitter.com\/7tyy3fryQJ","\u2014 Central Bank Payments News (@cbpaymentsnews) April 16, 2024","","Once the consultation phase concludes, the RBNZ will continue developing the structure and policy requirements, with an expected completion date in June 2025. After this phase, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted.","The RBNZ anticipates completing Stage 2 in 2026. At this point, recommendations will be made on whether to progress to Stage 3 of the New Zealand CBDC issuance process.","Stage 3 involves developing and testing prototypes to ensure the functionality of the digital cash system. The final stage, Stage 4, will mark the official launch of the New Zealand CBDC, anticipated by 2030.","ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· South Korean Central Bank to \u2018Speed up\u2019 CBDC Project","The South Korean Central Bank is set to \u201Cspeed up\u201D its CBDC project, and will pilot its digital KRW with a group of 100,000 citizens later this year.#CryptoNews #newshttps:\/\/t.co\/zfzltVAjRU","\u2014 Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 17, 2024","","Other nations are also actively exploring CBDCs.
