According to the researcher, miners are now at a crossroads \u2013 they can either capitulate to current market conditions or await a potential BTC price increase.","Ju expressed his concernsÂ on X that bitcoin miners were holding onto their crypto holdings despite plummeting revenues. Revenues have dropped to 2023 levels due to the just concluded bitcoin halving, which slashed block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.","#Bitcoin miners' revenue has dropped to levels seen in early 2023 following the halving.","Now they have two options: 1. Capitulation, or 2. Waiting for a rise in $BTC price.","There are no signs of capitulation for now. pic.twitter.com\/8GrYk7zcN1","\u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) April 30, 2024","","While the miners saw temporary higher revenue of over $100 million on the halving day, it has since been reduced, with Ju indicating that \u201Cthere are no signs of capitulation for now.\u201D","Bitcoin miners capitulate when the price drops, and the less efficient miners are forced off the network because the bitcoin they earn is not worth the cost to mine. This can lead them to sell their bitcoin reserves, resulting in further price drops.","On the other hand, miners may wait for a price increase, hoping that bitcoin\u2019s price will rise in the future, making it more profitable for them to continue mining.","The #Bitcoin miners I know is a group of humam beings who have the strongest faith on bitcoion and cryptos, so capitulation is never an option.

Markus Thielen, Head of Research at 10x Research, indicated that the crypto markets might not see any major upward movement until October 2024.","In contrast, Coincodex projected an optimistic market sentiment leading up to and after the bitcoin halving, with predictions indicating that bitcoin\u2019s price could experience a minor retracement about a month after the event. However, this retracement would be followed by a 14-month-long rally, they suggested, culminating in a new all-time high of approximately $179,000 in August 2025."],"entity":[{"type":"$179,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$73,750","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ki Young Ju (","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"9.47%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Markus Thielen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CEO Ki Young Ju","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"17.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"10x Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 30, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Head of Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4.46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$BTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$60K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"August 2025","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Miner","CryptoQuant"],"authors":["Jimmy Aki"]}
