Drops 8.5% as Solana Meme Legend SEAL Raises $250,000","category":["Industry Talk "],"content":["Solana\u2019s second biggest canine meme coin, Bonk ($BONK), tumbled 8.5% overnight as meme coins take some of the heaviest losses amidst a market-wide dip.","Bonk now trades at $0.00002525. At this price, it\u2019s about 7% more expensive than it was last week.","These numbers make for a more volatile reading than those from market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), but they are more stable than other high-market cap meme coins.¬†","The world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency with a market cap of over a trillion dollars, Bitcoin, dropped 1.4% in the last 24 hours but grew 3.8% over the seven days and now changes hands around $64,275.¬†","Its number one contender, the most commercially important blockchain Ethereum dropped 2.4% overnight but appreciated 1.8% over the seven days and trades at $3,124 as of this writing.¬†","Solana-based meme coins like BONK fared much better than their Ethereum or proprietary blockchain counterparts over the last week.","Solana projects that posted notable seven-day appreciation include DogWifHat ($WIF), which grew 30%. Book of Meme ($BOME) rallied 27% and Popcat ($POPCAT) mushroomed a staggering 45% over the week.","These gains far outdo the top performers among non-Solana meme coins. Original meme\/canine coin Dogecoin ($DOGE) only added 14.5% over the seven days while Pepe Coin ($PEPE) added 21%.","BONK\u2019s trading chart for the last three months begins with the token setting an all-time high (ATH) of $0.00004547 on March 4, although today\u2019s price represents a 44.5% pullback since then.¬†","Bonk spent the rest of March and April in gradual free fall, bottoming out around $0.000015 before turning green again.","With a relative strength index (RSI) of 45 and no clear indication of buying or selling momentum, BONK\u2019s price could go either way by the end of the week, depending on the industry-wide or macroeconomic outlook.","Solana meme coins will likely be the target for many investors hoping to help the ecosystem develop into the so-called \u201CEthereum killer\u201D it\u2019s often touted to be.","Sealana ($SEAL) is the latest in a long line of hilarious new Solana coins vying for attention.","The hillbilly seal has already raised more than$250,000¬†in a hilarious new presale that\u2019s barely a week old.¬†","#Sealana\u2019s on his hog, hitting the drive-thru for his 4x Big Mac fix.

It\u2019s the American Dream rewritten in Web3!","For every 1 SOL, investors get 6,900 $SEAL tokens when the presale ends.
