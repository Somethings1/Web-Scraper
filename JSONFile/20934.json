The filing also mentioned that Terra\u2019s collapse wiped out $45 bilion from the market.","The securities regulator emphasized that pooling money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits primarily stemming from the efforts of the promoters aligns with the Howey test.Â  Howey test is crucial legal criterion used to determine if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract.","SEC further stated that Terraform and Kwon had committed fraudulent acts and made deceptive statements.","The regulator reiterated allegations of deceiving investors regarding the stability of the UST stablecoin. The company falsely attributed its algorithm for price stabilization while clandestinely arranging third-party intervention.","These actions, the SEC contends, rendered their claims about the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness misleading and omitted crucial information.","Terra\u2019s collapse in May of the previous year resulted in the substantial loss of investor wealth, further fueling the SEC\u2019s arguments.","Earlier, Do Kwon\u2019s defense team urged the court to rule in their favor, asserting that the SEC had not sufficiently demonstrated that securities were being offered.","Do Kwon is currently serving a sentence in Montenegro for document forgery after being apprehended with counterfeit passports.","During his trial in South Korea, Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform, attributed Terraform Labs\u2019 failure to Do Kwon\u2019s mismanagement. He claimed to have distanced himself from the company and its operations two years prior to its collapse."],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Howey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$45 bilion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Terra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Daniel Shin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Do Kwon"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
