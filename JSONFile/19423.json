In addition, the report said that the central bank should strengthen its own capacity on cyber security and other areas to \u201Csafeguard financial integrity\u201D as the CBDC is pushed out to more users.","In terms of regulations, the report stated that the IMF sees it as \u201Cimportant\u201D that the Bahamas develops \u201Ca robust supervisory and regulatory framework\u201D for digital assets more broadly.","The Sand Dollar was originally rolled out by the Central Bank of the Bahamas in October of 2020, with the bank at the time promoting it as the world\u2019s first CBDC. However, adoption of the CBDC has hardly taken off, with the report claiming that less than 0.1% of currency in circulation on the island nation is currently made up of the central bank-issued token.","In a statement published along with the IMF report, Philip Jennings, Executive Director for the Bahamas, said that the central bank views the Sand Dollar as \u201Can important vehicle for payments systems modernization and resilience, as well as financial inclusion.\u201D","Jennings further blamed the slowdown in the adoption of the CBDC on the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that it \u201Cslowed the momentum of public education and roll out to businesses.\u201D ","Going forward, however, Jennings said that the authorities plan to accelerate information campaigns and other initiatives to push adoption forward.","\u201COur authorities welcome the [IMF\u2019s] prioritization of developing internal and external capacity in the area of CBDCs,\u201D the statement said.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bahamians Will be Allowed to Pay Taxes Using Digital Assets\n\u2013 First or Not, The Bahamas Trumps Leading Economies with CBDC Rollout\n\n\u2013 Bahamas, Cambodia, China Lead Global CBDC Race, UK Launches Taskforce\n\u2013 Alipay Provides Digital Yuan Boost as COVID-19 Deals PBoC Blow\n\n\u2013 Number of Central Banks Involved in CBDC Projects Almost Doubles in One Year\n\u2013 Russia Sanctions May Lead More Countries To Consider CBDCs, Ex-Central Banker Says"],"entity":[{"type":"UK Launches Taskforce\n\u2013 Alipay Provides Digital Yuan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"International Monetary Fund (IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank of the Bahamas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jennings","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Philip Jennings","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October of 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cambodia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"0.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"The Bahamas Trumps Leading Economies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Caribbean","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bahamas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CBDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","CBDC","Central Bank","Coronavirus","IMF","Regulation"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
