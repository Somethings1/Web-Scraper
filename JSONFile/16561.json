It is a sequence (chain) of sets (blocks) of transactions that everyone in the network agreed to be legitimate.","If you wondered where the blockchain is \u2013 it is in the nodes. Each node holds an identical version of the transactions.","When there\u2019s a new group of transactions (a block) on the blockchain, it gets broadcast from node to node so that every one of them can update its own database in the same way.","You may have heard that a blockchain network is \"distributed\" and \"peer-to-peer.\" This is because nodes are responsible for maintaining the correct database of past transactions in a distributed way, validating each other\u2019s dealings on the network.","Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work","In traditional finance, payment networks such as Visa or Paypal are held by a central administration.","In the case of most cryptocurrencies, the nodes of a blockchain do not rely on any validation from the top of the system because they check and verify each other by a consensus mechanism.","Thus, anyone can set up a node by downloading the blockchain\u2019s software onto their personal computer anywhere in the world.","Read More: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?"],"entity":[{"type":"Paypal","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Learn","Beginner","Technology"],"authors":["Benedict George"]}
