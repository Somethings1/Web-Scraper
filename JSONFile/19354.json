The SEC alleging it had been operating an unregistered securities trading platform.","This suit came months after settling charges over Kraken\u2019s former staking service.","In February 2024, Kraken filed to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that it relied solely on a registration-based argument regarding Kraken\u2019s operation as an unlicensed securities entity.","Kraken argued that cryptocurrencies listed as SEC-compliant should be treated like commodities and not securities.","However, now Kraken has escalated its position, urging the court to dismiss the claims to avoid a \u201Csignificant reordering\u201D of the US financial regulatory structure, according to court filings submitted in the Northern District of California on Thursday.","The SEC filed an opposition to Kraken\u2019s motion to dismiss, asserting that its enforcement action falls within its congressionally granted authority. They emphasize its role in enforcing registration requirements for securities intermediaries.","\u201CIn applying the Howey test in its determination that Kraken must register, the SEC is simply following its Congressional mandate.\u201D","They also stated that it\u2019s not overstepping its powers and doesn\u2019t need to \u201Cenact bespoke laws to each new technology that emerges.\u201D","Kraken\u2019s response to the SEC\u2019s motion centers on interpreting the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction through the Howey test.","This assesses whether an investment qualifies as a security based on 4 main criteria: an investment of money, expectation of profits, common enterprise, and reliance on the efforts of others. Kraken\u2019s lawyers argued against:","\u201CThe SEC cannot satisfy Howey\u2019s additional requirements that there be investments of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.\u201D","According to Kraken, the SEC\u2019s interpretation would unnecessarily broaden its jurisdiction beyond what was intended, potentially drastically changing the financial regulatory environment. They said:","\u201CThis would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. Such a significant reordering of the US\u2019s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.\u201D","Kraken is just one of many leading companies within the crypto space battling with the SEC. Coinbase, Uniswap, Metamask, and Robinhood have also received regulatory action.","Despite making no progress on individual cases, the SEC continues to challenge major players in the space.","In 2023, like Kraken, Coinbase locked into a battle with the SEC after the federal agency accused the crypto exchange of selling unregistered securities.","Legal counsel for Coinbase had requested that DC Judge Katherine Polk Failla determine whether or not the matter falls outside of the agency\u2019s delegated authority.","During a January hearing, Failla pushed back against Coinbase\u2019s request to restrict the SEC\u2019s regulatory scope.","However, Judge Failla placed the case on hold questioning the overreach of the SEC in their claims. She stated:","\u201CI worry that I would be doing exactly the thing you\u2019re alleging the Commission is doing here, which is to take power that I don\u2019t have to stop activity I shouldn\u2019t be stopping.\u201D","The continued assault on the crypto space has prompted many figures to speak out, citing the SEC\u2019s anti-crypto agenda to be an attempt to push crypto out of the US.","Ethereum Co-founder Joseph Lubin criticized the SEC\u2019s approach, alleging that instead of fostering open discourse and providing clear regulatory guidelines, the SEC has opted for strategic enforcement actions.","This has caused unease within the cryptocurrency industry amidst such regulatory uncertainty,Â  causing US investors have become hesitant to enter the space. Lubin commented:","\u201CThe SEC probably doesn\u2019t want to see a wave of innovation that will really transform the landscape.\u201D","In February 2024, the Crypto and Financial Technology Advocacy Group (CFAT), which includes prominent figures like Paradigm, Coinbase, and Ledger, filed a lawsuit against the SEC.","This came under claims that \u201CThe SEC\u2019s novel attempt to extend its regulatory power to virtually all digital assets reach far beyond the scope of its statutory authority.\u201D","CFAT also argued that SEC\u2019s ruling-by-enforcement approach has hindered crypto\u2019s innovation. They claim the SEC has:","\u201CLeft this trillion-dollar industry in an unsustainable state of uncertainty, subject to the arbitrary enforcement whims of an agency with an overly broad view of its own authority.\u201D","Today, we at @LEJILEX and the Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas sued the @SECGov to put an end to its aggressive and unorthodox enforcement actions against our industry: https:\/\/t.co\/HPQfsOtML1","\u2014 Mike Wawszczak ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@mikewawszczak) February 21, 2024","","Hence, Kraken\u2019s position on the matter urged a dismissal. For the SEC to continue, it must revaluate the current US legal framework.
