It had risen 20% over the course of a week amid indications of pending approval and updated odds of the ETFs getting approved. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index that tracks the biggest tokens, fell 4.5% over 24 hours and the crypto market cap lost 2.9% to $2.5 trillion.","\u201CEthereum's sell-off on positive news is a typical \"buy the rumors, sell the facts\" reaction of speculators,\u201D Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk. \u201CWe shouldn't be surprised if the price pulls back to the $3000 area again, returning to an important consolidation area. From these levels, large institutional investors can start building a position in ETFs.","\u201CWe saw the same in January after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, which took 19% off its price in the following two weeks before there was a spectacular reversal,\u201D he said.","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday approved key regulatory filings tied to ether ETFs, a historic milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency. They are not, however, cleared to trade. Although the SEC approved the 19B-4 form that allows for the offering and listing of ETFs, it must still green light the funds' S-1 filings before investors can buy them.","The regulator approved documents for eight ETFs \u2013 from VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK Invest 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy and BlackRock \u2013 for listing on the Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX exchanges.","If the ETFs are approved for trading, a significant influx of institutional capital is likely. Standard Chartered predicted inflows of as much as $45 billion in the first 12 months.","Some traders say they expect ether to rally over 60% in the coming months, with a marked increase in futures and spot buying demand for the token in the past week.","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"4.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2.9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitwise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Franklin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex Kuptsikevich","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$3000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.5 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Cboe","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Invesco Galaxy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$45 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NYSE Arca","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Markets","Bitcoin","ether ETF"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
