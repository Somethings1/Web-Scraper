Market analysts say that they expect the bank to raise interest rates up to three times this year, with the next rise possibly coming in the next few weeks. This, they say, could lead to an \u201Cadjustment\u201D in share prices \u2013 and possibly more movement in the crypto markets as a result.","Per Digital Today, a large number of South Korean securities providers have begun reporting on the state of crypto markets after witnessing \u201Cexplosive growth\u201D last year. Hana Financial Investment, a wing of the KEB Hana banking group, yesterday devoted a third of its monthly investment report to the crypto space for the first time.","The media outlet noted that the new year has seen a new trend for securities providers, with most now including some sort of section devoted to crypto. Most of these reports are thus far relatively conservative in nature, and when they do give advice on crypto, are being careful to advise \u201Csmall\u201D investments as part of a wider portfolio of conventional assets. However, some claimed that such crypto investments could \u201Cgreatly improve the performance\u201D of investors\u2019 portfolios.\n\nThe \u201Cheads of large securities firms\u201D appear to have \u201Cexpressed interest in the sector by mentioning virtual assets in their New Year\u2019s addresses,\u201D the media outlet noted \u2013 with attention also given to the blockchain, metaverse and non-fungible token (NFT) spaces. The heads of Mirae Asset Securities, NH Investment & Securities and the aforementioned Shinhan Financial Investment were all quoted as making note of how crypto and the rest had \u201Ccreated new markets and businesses.\u201D","Both media outlets noted that the trend appears to be global to some extent, claiming that major financial advisors in Europe and North America had given similar advice about including a small amount of crypto in investment portfolios. ","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 S Korean Lawmaker to Launch Bitcoin, ETH Political Donations Platform \u2013 with NFT Receipts\n\u2013 South Korean Gaming Regulator to Force Crypto Games off Google, Apple App Marketplaces\n\n\u2013 S Korea Now Has 24 Licenced Crypto Exchanges \u2013 But Most Are Stuck in Crypto-to-Crypto Purgatory\n\u2013 South Korea to Tax Crypto Gifts, Inheritances, Plans Crackdown on Manipulators\n\n\u2013 Rising Number Of Investors Sell Stocks, Bonds To Buy Crypto \u2013 Survey\n\u2013 Mom Starts Crypto Consulting Firm, Makes up to USD 80K per Month\n\n\u2013 5 Key Trends to Watch in 2022 According to Grayscale CEO\n\u2013 5 Crypto Index Tokens That Allow You to \u2018Buy the Market\u2019"],"entity":[{"type":"Crypto Purgatory","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NH Investment & Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shinhan Financial Investment","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"North America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Shinhan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hana Financial Investment","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bank of Korea","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"KEB Hana","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Newspim","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NongHyup Bank\u2019s NH","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Force Crypto Games","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Tax Crypto Gifts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mirae Asset Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Banking","Cryptocurrency","Investing","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
