The cryptocurrency\u2019s recent uplift is attributed to dovish economic data from the U.S., hinting at possible Federal Reserve rate cuts.","This anticipation has weakened the dollar and, in turn, boosted Bitcoin\u2019s value. Additionally, significant inflows of $11.54 million into Bitcoin ETFs, like Grayscale and Bitwise, along with Trump\u2019s positive remarks on cryptocurrencies, have further fueled the upward movement.","The latest US employment data reveals a slowing labour market, stirring optimism within the cryptocurrency sector. Recently, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly to 231,000 for the week ending May 3, significantly higher than the anticipated 210,000.","This uptick suggests a softening job market, which might prompt the Federal Reserve to consider rate cuts sooner than anticipated\u2014a scenario that typically benefits cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.","Investors are now keenly awaiting further economic reports, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), to gauge future monetary policy directions.Â ","This expectation fosters a bullish outlook for cryptocurrencies.","Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will reach at least $1 million by 2030. This forecast coincides with his recent departure from the decentralized platform BlueSky, motivated by shifts away from its original vision of true decentralization.","Jack Dorsey's Bold Bitcoin Bet: $1M by 2030https:\/\/t.co\/pzkx48CVoz","\u2014 C-Dub (ðŸ”‘,ðŸ”‘) (@Stocktrader) May 10, 2024","","Simultaneously, Dorsey\u2019s fintech enterprise, Block, faces regulatory scrutiny, impacting its services like Square and Cash App. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin shows robustness in the market, maintaining a price of around $61,000.","While Dorsey remains optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s potential, the ongoing regulatory pressures and market uncertainties continue to pose significant challenges.","","Today, Bitcoin is priced at $60,620, witnessing a decline of around 4% within the last 24 hours.Â Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC is holding below $60,975. Above this pivot, immediate resistance levels are observed at $63,400, followed by $65,050, and extending to $67,160, which may challenge further upward movements.","Conversely, support levels are marked distinctly, beginning at $59,075 and subsequent support at $56,640 and $54,400.","Technical indicators reflect a cautious outlook; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 38, indicating a potential overselling scenario. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $62,325, providing a reference point for current price actions.","Bitcoin\u2019s recent market behaviour shows a bearish engulfing pattern on the 4-hour chart, breaching the upward trendline at $60,975. This breakdown suggests potential downward pressure, targeting the immediate support level at $59,075.","Conclusion: Bitcoin\u2019s current market stance is bearish, below the $60,975 threshold. A decisive move above this level could, however, pivot towards a bullish trend.","","","","The 99BitcoinsÂ presale is currently underway, offering a unique opportunity in cryptocurrency education. By participating in this \u2018learn-to-earn\u2019 platform, users can enhance their understanding of digital currencies while acquiring $99BTC tokens, which are both a reward mechanism and a gateway to premium content and community benefits.","With the token price set at $0.00104 each, early investors are provided a cost-effective entry point to start growing their expertise and investment simultaneously.","As of now, the presale has successfully raised $1,169,037, moving closer to the target of $1,892,544.
