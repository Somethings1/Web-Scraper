While historical data exists on the blockchain, cryptocurrency\u2019s history is relatively short, and its future uncertain.\u201D","However, CoreData believes that the majority of advisers\u2019 reluctance to explore the cryptocurrency market presents an opportunity for advisory firms to specialize in or enhance their understanding of this emerging asset class.","Financial advisers are beginning to allocate to $BTC, around 3.5% of a client\u2019s portfolio. If this practice becomes widely adopted, the inflows into crypto will be staggering, in the $trillions.","Beyond that, managed funds are also now able to expose themselves to crypto by\u2026","\u2014 Sam (@SamCKx) March 19, 2024","","Interestingly, the survey revealed that 67% of crypto holders expressed interest in receiving professional advice on the subject.","The highest demand for advice came from individuals who hold cryptocurrency due to their belief in its potential for value appreciation or concerns about inflation.","\u201CFor advisers seeking to develop their skills in the area, crypto-assets represent an opportunity to build a unique offering for their business,\u201D the survey said.","\u201CPractices that put in the effort to develop competency in the area will have the chance to increase their assets under management among cohorts of crypto-curious investors, as well as seasoned crypto holders who have built wealth via blockchain,\u201D it added.","As younger generations, who are digitally savvy, become a larger part of the market, the demand for digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokenized real-world assets, is expected to rise.","Consequently, building expertise in blockchain-based assets becomes a crucial consideration for future-proofing advisory practices in Australia.","As reported, Morgan Stanley, one of the leading financial institutions, is exploring the possibility of expandingÂ its sales of Bitcoin ETFs by allowing its approximately 15,000 brokers to actively recommend these products to customers.","Currently, Morgan Stanley offers Bitcoin ETFs on an unsolicited basis, meaning that customers must approach their advisors independently to express interest in investing.","By enabling advisors to actively recommend these products, the firm could potentially broaden its customer base, although it would also expose itself to additional liability.","Some financial institutions, like Raymond James Financial and Vanguard, have chosen not to offer cryptocurrency products, citing concerns about their suitability for long-term portfolios.","LPL Financial, the largest independent brokerage with over 22,000 brokers, announced plans in February to evaluate which Bitcoin funds it could offer to customers."],"entity":[{"type":"CoreData\u2019s \u201CAustralia\u2019s Crypto Investors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Morgan Stanley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoreData","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"3.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sam (","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"89%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"67%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"LPL Financial","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$trillions","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Australia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 19, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$BTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Morgan Stanley","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Raymond James Financial","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vanguard","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Cryptocurrency","Financial Advice"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
