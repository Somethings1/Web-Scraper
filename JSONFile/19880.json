He explained:","\u201CI don\u2019t think that the ban on cryptocurrencies [\u2026] is the right decision. Yes, many of the arguments given by the regulator are reasonable and correct from the point of view of economic security. But I share the position of experts [\u2026] who see a future in blockchain technologies and believe that a ban on cryptocurrencies would negatively affect the IT development of Russia.\u201D","Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the parliamentary committee that deals with financial markets and the chief broker of crypto legislation, also played down talk of an outright ban, stating:","\u201CVarious options are being discussed and will continue to be discussed. It is too early to say that the committee has come to an unequivocal position on this issue.\u201D","He said that his committee would look at the Central Bank\u2019s proposal, but \u201Cwill also consider other proposals.\u201D","\u201CSo far,\u201D Aksakov said, \u201Cpoints of view differ quite dramatically,\u201D adding:","\u201CThe committee is an arbiter in this discussion and it is important for us to hear all sides. Based on these discussions, we will make a decision.\u201D","Lenta reported that Andrey Lugovoy, the First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, has also spoken out against the proposed ban.","And the same media outlet noted that MPs had asserted that \u201Cthe Central Bank is alone in calling for total bans\u201D within the working group charged with creating a law to regulate crypto and mining this year.","The outlet noted that \u201Cnot a single government body supports the position taken up by the Central Bank so far.\u201D","Indeed, MPs were quoted as expressing the fear that talk of such \u201Crepressive\u201D measures \u201Cmay make Russia a laughing stock for the whole world.\u201D","PlusWorld quoted Lugavoy as stating:","\u201CIf you make statements asking to \u2018categorically prohibit everything,\u2019 then you need to justify them as much as possible, with specific, clear and understandable numbers and with an explanation of what we should do about people who currently hold cryptocurrency. No one knows why the Central Bank has taken up such a radical position.\u201D","He added that talk of \u201Chigh volatility\u201D and \u201Cpyramid schemes\u201D would not do as it is possible to \u201Cgive examples of many things that are part of our lives, but are also risky for citizens.\u201D","Meanwhile, Aksakov also added that a crypto bill may hit the State Duma (Russia\u2019s parliament) in time for its spring session, but added that \u201Cno bills on this matter\u201D have come before committees as of yet. Regardless, he called on the government to hurry. Tass quoted him as stating:","\u201CDuring the spring session, it is important for us to adopt some kind of legal document that determines the shape of regulation in the market. It is developing too fast, there are too many investors. And it is important to draw a line under many issues, especially because mining is creating problems for consumers\u2019 electricity, for local authorities. And in order to regulate this issue at least, we must make the appropriate legal decision.\u201D","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Ban Crypto, but Legalize Mining and Issue Gold-backed Stablecoin, Urges Top Russian MP\n\u2013 Russia: Total Ban on Crypto Ownership Still on Table, Says Top Official\n\n\u2013 Crypto Anonymity Must End, States Top Russian Policymaker\n\u2013 Russian Intelligence Service Wants More Power to Seize Crypto, Freeze Wallets\n\n\u2013 Time to \u2018Resolve All Crypto Issues\u2019 Says Russian Parliament\n\u2013 Russian Provinces Free to Make Crypto Miners Pay Higher Electricity Rates, Says Gov\u2019t"],"entity":[{"type":"Crypto Ownership Still on Table","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tass","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elvira Nabiullina","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Andrey Lugovoy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u2019s Committee on Information Policy, Information Technology and Communications","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State Duma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anton Gorelkin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Russian Intelligence Service Wants More Power to Seize Crypto, Freeze Wallets\n\n\u2013 Time to \u2018Resolve All Crypto Issues\u2019 Says Russian Parliament\n\u2013 Russian Provinces Free to Make Crypto Miners Pay Higher Electricity Rates","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aksakov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Anatoly Aksakov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Committee on Security","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moscow","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"spring","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency","Mining","Politics","Regulation","Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
