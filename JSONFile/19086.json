The letter is a so-called Wells notice, used by the regulator to notify companies of possible enforcement action taken against them.","Paxos issues both the Pax Dollar (USDP) and the popular Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoins and is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.","According to a Wall Street Journal report that cited sources \u201Cfamiliar with the matter,\u201D the notice alleged that Paxos\u2019 dollar-pegged BUSD stablecoin is an unregistered security. The stablecoin is issued by Paxos for Binance, but it is also traded on several other crypto exchanges, including Coinbase.","The report added that it was unclear whether the notice related to the issuing of BUSD, the listing of the coin on exchanges, or both.","Paxos has so far not commented on the story, but Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), said in a Twitter thread on Sunday that \u201Cfunds are SAFU!\u201D","According to CZ, the only thing that will change in practice, for now, is that Paxos will no longer mint new BUSD tokens.","\u201CAs a result, BUSD market cap will only decrease over time,\u201D he wrote. The Binance CEO added that Paxos \u201Cwill continue to service the product, and manage redemptions.\u201D","Despite these reassurances, CZ admitted that users will likely migrate to other stablecoins \u201Cover time.\u201D He said Binance will make the necessary adjustments internally, including \u201Cmove away from using BUSD as the main pair for trading.\u201D","7\/ Binance will continue to support BUSD for the foreseeable future. We do foresee users migrating to other stablecoins over time. And we will make product adjustments accordingly. eg, move away from using BUSD as the main pair for trading, etc.","BUSD currently has a market cap of close to $16 billion and ranks as the third largest stablecoin after Tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC).","According to the Wall Street Journal, the SEC\u2019s move is seen as part of an escalating campaign against crypto companies in the US.","Over the past few days, US regulators have acted against the crypto exchange Kraken for alleged securities violations, including offering unregistered securities to users. The action led to a settlement agreement, where Kraken agreed to pay a $30 million fine for failing to register its crypto staking-as-a-service program.","Kraken CEO Jesse Powell responded to the situation sarcastically on Twitter, saying that if it was as easy as just \u201Cfill out a form on a website\u201D he would have done so long ago.","Oh man, all I had to do was fill out a form on a website and tell people that staking rewards come from staking? Wish I'd seen this video before paying a $30m fine and agreeing to permanently shut down the service in the US. How dumb do I look. Gosh. ‚õΩÔ∏èüí°https:\/\/t.co\/UPdQdnI6xN","Prior to that, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also commented on the escalating situation, saying on Twitter that he had heard rumors that the SEC \u201Cwould like to get rid of crypto staking\u201D in the US.","\u201CI hope that\u2019s not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen,\u201D Armstrong said at the time, while also calling staking \u201Ca really important innovation in crypto.\u201D","2\/ Staking is a really important innovation in crypto. It allows users to participate directly in running open crypto networks. Staking brings many positive improvements to the space, including scalability, increased security, and reduced carbon footprints.",""],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$16 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$30 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jesse Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Twitter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paxos","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Armstrong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$30m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"New York State Department of Financial Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Binance","SEC"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
