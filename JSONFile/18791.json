The fund directly backs its shares with a fixed amount of BTC, which gradually declines over time due to management fees.","The other two Bitcoin-related investments include a $99,000 position in the Bitcoin ATM provider Bitcoin Depot and a $1.2 million position in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), a Bitcoin futures ETF.","The total position represents just a drop of Wells Fargo\u2019s $603 billion in assets under management and has likely shrunk alongside Bitcoin\u2019s price since the reporting period.","Nevertheless, the crypto community has hailed the bank\u2019s allocation as a massive step toward institutional Bitcoin adoption.","Back in 2018, the same bank temporarily banned crypto credit card purchases, but its analysts came to recognize Bitcoin\u2019s rapid adoption growth and price appreciation over the coming years.","In 2020, Wells Fargo closed my accounts and ended their banking relation with me after 22 years in 2020. Why? Because I was buying too much #bitcoin. Now look.","They are all coming to #Bitcoin. They have no choice. Game theory is at play now and it's just getting started.\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/lZkfaRwAkc","\u2014 Oliver L. Velez ⚡️ 13%'er Bitcoiner (@olvelez007) May 10, 2024","","Wells Fargo began offering Bitcoin ETFs as an investment option in February for clients who specifically requested the product. Since launching in January, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs have absorbed $11.8 billion of net inflows.","Other major financial institutions have also disclosed substantial allocations to Bitcoin ETFs in previous weeks. So far, the largest known owner of the products is Susquehanna International Group, an investment firm with $438 billion AUM holding $1.8 billion in Bitcoin ETFs.","Interestingly, both Wells Fargo and Susquehanna invested most heavily into GBTC, which is the most expensive of all its competitors. The fund charges 1.5% per year in management fees, compared to a 0.3% management cost from most other rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity.","Grayscale is currently the largest Bitcoin ETF thanks to its pre-ETF launch Bitcoin stack, but only by a thin margin. The fund has suffered nearly endless outflows since January 11."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wells Fargo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 10, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AUM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Susquehanna International Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$438 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Oliver L.
