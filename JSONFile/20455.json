Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. ","\u201CAs alleged in our complaint, Coinbase was fully aware of the applicability of the federal securities laws to its business activities, but deliberately refused to follow them.\u201D","The regulator also named 13 cryptocurrencies as securities, according to the complaint. ","\u201CThroughout the Relevant Period, Coinbase has made available for trading crypto assets that are being offered and sold as investment contracts, and thus as securities. This includes, but is not limited to, the units of each of the crypto asset securities further described below\u2014with trading symbols SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO\u2014(the \u2018Crypto Asset Securities\u2019),\u201D the SEC said.","Some of those coins were also labeled as securities in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance on Monday. ","\u201CThe SEC\u2019s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America\u2019s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,\u201D said Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, in an emailed statement. \u201CThe solution is legislation that allows fair rules for the road to be developed transparently and applied equally, not litigation. In the meantime, we\u2019ll continue to operate our business as usual.\u201D ","This comes just one day after the regulator sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao over 13 charges. ","Binance Holdings Ltd., and its US affiliates, were charged on Monday by the SEC for a slew of different charges, from allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange to offering unregistered securities. ","Coinbase is also facing an ongoing feud with a US regulator after it was served a Wells notice in March over some of its products. ","A Wells notice means that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is ready to recommend formal charges to its five-member commission. ","SEC Chair Gary Gensler has called on exchanges to register and recently said this month that they tend to be \u201Crife with conflicts.\u201D ","Updated at 8:48 a.m. ET to include cryptocurrencies named securities by the SEC and add that Coinbase executives had not been charged. ","Updated at 10:14 a.m. ET to include a statement from Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal "],"entity":[{"type":"FIL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase, Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10:14 a.m.","content":"TIME"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Relevant Period","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gurbir S.
