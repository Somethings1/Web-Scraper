Others include SocialConnect, a privacy-focused naming service; and FiatConnect, a ramp that will make it easier for users to transact using USDT.","Tether wants to take advantage of this broad base to promote the adoption of Celo solutions and see more users adopt USDT. With USDT minting on Celo now available, users can use the stablecoin transparently and in a cheap environment.","The collaboration extends beyond offering USDT on Celo. A proposal on the Celo community forum suggests using USDT to pay transaction fees. This approach could streamline transactions and enhance the efficiency of decentralized applications (dapps).","\u201CWe are committed to providing accessible and reliable digital currency solutions,\u201D said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. This integration with Celo represents a significant step forward\u2014together, we can make Tether more usable and accessible for millions.\u201D","On March 7, Rarible, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, integrated Celo.
