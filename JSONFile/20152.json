By utilizing the Lightning Network, Aperture transforms any API into a pay-per-use resource gated via L402 functionality. ","Lightning Labs has also presented the L402 bLIP, a Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal for the L402 protocol standard that would share the fundamental building blocks of these components.","The L402 protocol, derived from the HTTP 402 Payment Required status response code, represents a significant advancement in decentralized payment systems. ","It combines the authentication functionality of macaroons, an authentication mechanism for distributed systems, with the global permissionless payments offered by the Lightning Network. ","An additional advantage these tools bring is their ability to monetize access to various software applications. ","As the expenses associated with training GPUs for AI applications can be significant, developers often look to recoup costs through credit cards, resulting in higher fees for end users due to chargebacks and fraud expenses. ","The L402-enabled tools now offer users the opportunity to sell and pay for API queries, unlocking new revenue streams and promoting a more sustainable economic model.","\u201CWith the L402 protocol and LangChainBitcoin, we\u2019re able to ensure the open models can be accessed using an open payment system,\u201D the company said in the announcement, concluding that \u201Cin the end, open source will win.\u201D","The AI industry has seen a surge in popularity after the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT last November. ","OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research company and ChatGPT is one of its advanced chatbots that garnered more than 100 million users a mere two months after launching. "],"entity":[{"type":"Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lightning Network Daemon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lightning Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"GPT","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Artificial Intelligence","Bitcoin","Lightning Network"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
