Schumer voted in support of nullifying SAB 121 today. If anyone can convince POTUS to sign, it\u2019s Schumer. We have a very real chance of getting this across the finish line. https:\/\/t.co\/z0S9ttwaZc","\u2014 Perianne (@PerianneDC) May 16, 2024","","\u201CIt is unfortunate that the SEC would attempt to circumvent the rulemaking process while falsely claiming that SAB 121 is simply non-binding staff-level guidance,\u201D Flood continued.","While Biden may veto the resolution to nullify SAB121, Thursday\u2019s strong show of bipartisan support for the resolution may prove hopeful for advancing crypto legislation in general.","\u201CThe second most powerful democrat in the country Sen.
