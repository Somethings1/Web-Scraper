This move is in line with the crypto exchange\u2019s ongoing strategy to exit the Russian market.","Binance\u2019s collaboration with Advcash started in 2019. It allowed Binance customers to deposit and withdraw rubles, facilitating transactions for Russian traders using its service.","Through Advcash, customers could move funds from the sanctioned Russian banks to Binance. Advcash\u2019s site provided links to \u201Cindependent exchange providers\u201D that could handle transfers from customers\u2019 accounts at Russian banks to the platform. Users could then move funds between their Advcash and Binance accounts.","An Advcash spokesperson mentioned they had not received any updates from Binance regarding ceasing the partnership. Yet, the unfolding scenario mirrors the shift in Binance\u2019s operational strategy in Russia.","In September, Binance announced the sale of its Russian operations to the crypto exchange CommEX. This marked a significant step in Binance\u2019s endeavor to comply with global regulatory standards, particularly amidst the evolving legal landscape governing cryptocurrencies.","Binance\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer, Noah Perlman, emphasized the compliance-centric motive behind the exit. \u201CAs we look toward the future, we recognize that operating in Russia is not compatible with Binance\u2019s compliance strategy,\u201D Perlman stated on Sept 27.","This operational realignment demonstrated Binance\u2019s commitment to adhering to regulatory norms. By opting out of the ruble payment partnership with Advcash, Binance is signaling its adherence to a compliance-driven business ethos, a crucial pivot in its broader company strategy in the world."],"entity":[{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Perlman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Noah Perlman","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Russia"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
