{"summary":"Justine Bone, a cybersecurity firebrand whose research led to recalls of half a million faulty pacemakers, leads the soon-to-launch information-sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for crypto firms.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2024\/05\/06\/crypto-now-has-a-neighborhood-watch-to-guard-against-hacks\/","publishDate":"2024-05-06T13:00:00","id":16904,"type":null,"title":"Crypto Gets Another 'Neighborhood Watch' to Guard Against Hacks","category":["Finance"],"content":["The cryptocurrency industry, for years plagued by hacks and other malfeasance, has a new group dedicated to cleaning things up, headed by cybersecurity veteran Justine Bone.","Bone is the executive director of Crypto ISAC, the industry's first information-sharing and analysis center, essentially a hub for cybersecurity analysis. A leader in cybersecurity and cryptography for more than 25 years, she was the CEO of medical security research firm MedSec, where her work (in partnership with a short-selling hedge fund) led directly to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalling half a million pacemakers that were susceptible to hacking. The devices' manufacturer, Abbott (formerly St. Jude Medical), later issued a firmware update to patch the security holes.","The full roster of Crypto ISAC's founding members, who are providing financial support for the organization, will be revealed on-stage May 29 at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. Included in the list are two of the biggest exchanges, a major stablecoin issuer, one of the best-known custody firms in the field as well as many other household names in crypto.","\u201CUp until now, there has not been a crypto ISAC and some people are surprised when they learn that,\u201D Bone said in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201CSo a few years ago, some cybersecurity companies who were then joined by some other heavy hitters in the crypto industry, recognized this gap and started organizing.\"","A similar effort, known as SEAL-ISAC, launched last month. It is led by Samczsun, head of security for the venture capital firm Paradigm. \"The SEAL org[anization] has saved over $50,000,000 for crypto users and projects so far,\" said a spokesperson for SEAL-ISAC, in a May 7 email to CoinDesk.","About $1.7 billion was lost to hackers of crypto platforms in 2023, according to blockchain-sleuthing firm Chainalysis.","ISACs were introduced as non-profit organizations in the late 1990s to facilitate and legitimize information sharing around cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents between public sector and private sector organizations. They are often compared to neighborhood watch programs.","The unveiling of Crypto ISAC, which has been several years in the making, is something of a badge of honor, as it joins the crypto industry with many other established verticals that use information sharing to protect critical infrastructure, such as healthcare, retail, the financial sector, the automotive industry and many more.","Bone describes an ISAC as \u201Ca trusted intermediary that sort of sits in the middle of the conversation around security issues.\u201D Typically these issues could be a heads-up about a new vulnerability in a type of technology, or an active incident underway, where practitioners need to hustle and collaborate to fix the problem, she said.","Bone served for years as a member of the Blackhat Review Board, the internationally recognized cybersecurity event series and provider of security research. She also worked as an information security lead at Dow Jones and Bloomberg, has advised several Fortune 50 companies and continues to serve on tech giant HP's advisory board.","The organizers of Crypto ISAC run the gamut \"from crypto-native companies through to investors ... and cybersecurity solutions providers who specialize in crypto and Web3,\" Bone said. The team has met with and briefed government officials, she said.","The information-sharing protocol underpinning the platform is thoroughly vetted and already adopted by most other ISACs, she said. As well as having the necessary cybersecurity certificates, she said the Crypto ISAC will be \"FedRAMP-ready,\" an important designation that qualifies an organization to deliver services to the U.S. government.","\u201CWe\u2019re going to be setting up this platform in the next couple of weeks, so when we launch at Consensus, our members will actually have a platform they can log into and see this threat intelligence,\u201D Bone said.","UPDATE (May 6, 2024, 19:10 UTC): Clarifies government officials' role in 10th paragraph.","CORRECTION (May 7, 2024, 17:00 UTC): Adds passage about a similar group, SEAL ISAC; tweaks headline and subheadline accordingly.","Edited by Marc Hochstein and Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Justine Bone","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Austin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Marc Hochstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dow Jones","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"HP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"late 1990s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"St. Jude Medical)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paradigm","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Samczsun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blackhat Review Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 7, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto ISAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$50,000,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Cybersecurity","Hacks","Exploits"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
