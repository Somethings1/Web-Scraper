Upland has now been bringing that proposition to life with Property-to-USD. By spending the past two years building a metaverse that offers true ownership of digital assets via blockchain tech, Upland has asymptotically been approaching their goal of building a fully realized market-based digital economy.","So far, they have allowed purchasing of digital assets via fiat or crypto (through UPX) and the in-game resale and trading of those assets. Upland has established a true free market based on supply and demand. While they acknowledge that they have been host to speculators and hodlers, optimists and pessimists, buyers and sellers alike, Upland\u2019s new partnership with Tilia Pay marked the day when Upland became a true market-based economy. Why?","Because in Upland, the value of your digital assets can now be converted back into a real-world value form: U.S. dollars.","Upland is now an extension of the international economy. The surplus value of players\u2019 engagement with their metaverse\u2014from the properties they decide to buy, to their locations, down to the very moment when players decided to buy them, all of those critical decisions that propel and agitate, on a macro level, Upland\u2019s free market\u2019s demand curves\u2014can now be recouped in U.S. dollars.Upland is the first and only blockchain metaverse to offer this ability.","Upland\u2019s users can sell their virtual NFT property assets using Second Life\u2019s payments network, called Tilia Pay. This integration supports PayPal as a main payment mechanism. This means that players will be able to buy real estate in Upland\u2019s virtual world and sell it for real U.S. dollars.","Known as the Property-to-USD beta program, already facilitated many high-value sales of Upland digital properties for USD. The top three sales have been USD 1,000 a piece. To date, Upland\u2019s players have spent USD 29,250 on properties in the Upland metaverse, and their average spend is USD 39.50","Unlike many other blockchain games, Upland has a clean, smooth user experience on the web, iOS, and Android in order to attract the widest possible audience. Since the Property-to-USD program is still in beta, the ability to sell properties for USD is currently open to 100 Uplanders. However, that number will increase in the near future and the feature will soon be available for all players. However, any player can purchase properties from the beta testers for USD.","Here\u2019s how Upland\u2019s beta testers earn real money with their virtual property portfolio:","The Upland community has welcomed the ability to earn money from their virtual properties with open arms. There have already indeed been some big sales! The spending frenzy kicked off when one player, an Upland Executive named ThankMeLater, sold three different properties for USD 500 USD. The buyer of those 3 properties is a player called Wulfinite, who joined Upland just a few months prior. He was interviewed about his rationale behind purchasing the properties:","Tilia Pay will allow Upland players to trade virtual properties, based on real-world locations and factored by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), for U.S. dollars. This makes Upland the only blockchain game to enable players to convert the financial value of virtual assets back into real money.","Upland continues to experience significant wins. With a highly active community, more than 10,000 daily active users, and over 40,000 monthly active users, Upland is continuing to grow significantly.
