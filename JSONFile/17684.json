This programmed adjustment occurs every four years and follows the pattern set since the first halving in 2012. It is designed to control inflation and mimic the scarcity of traditional resources.","In an interview with Cryptonews.com, Adam Sullivan, President and CEO of Core Scientific, discusses the challenges and opportunities this halving presents. Core Scientific is one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the U.S. with seven facilities across five states.","Sullivan first established the peculiar environment and the transformative nature of this upcoming event coinciding with the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the same year.","\u201CThis halving is interesting, it\u2019s a bit different than 2020. I would say we\u2019re more decentralized than we were in 2020 in terms of where miners are located,\u201D he explained.","\u201CWe\u2019re at a point now where majority of the hash rate that\u2019s online today actually can stay online post-halving,\u201D said Sullivan. \u201CI think that\u2019s going to elongate the cycle.\u201D","Due to the potential infrastructure constraint, Sullivan believed that there would be limited new generation machines that may go online. In addition, the miners are going to see a considerable margin compression over the course of the first few months after the halving.","\u201CI would say a number of marginal operators are actually going to be able to survive, but only for so long,\u201D said Sullivan.","As he anticipated a hard time for miners, Sullivan also argued that many players in the industry would sell their assets and even companies for cash by the end of 2024.","\u201CYou can only survive on getting cash, making some money some amount of money for three to four months before a lot of these companies have to say \u2018I need a big cash infusion. Let me go sell some of my assets,\u2019\u201D he elaborated.","\u201CI think no one will be surprised by a significant amount of M&A (mergers and acquisitions) that occurred,\u201D noted Sullivan.","In addition to the halving event, the future of the U.S. mining industry faces major changes driven by external economic factors and the ongoing search for cost-effective mining locations.","As the power prices trend higher in regulated markets, Sullivan predicts a restructured and redefined mining business in North America, especially when miners struggle to find opportunities to operate sizable facilities across the United States.","\u201CI would say it\u2019s amazing how people can find low-cost power in other countries,\u201D he said. \u201CThe China shutdown in 2021 accelerated the exploration throughout the world. And I would say we\u2019re kind of going through that again.\u201D","Looking into the next cycle till 2028, Sullivan pointed out the emerging opportunities in Africa and South America, and highlighted the Middle East as a burgeoning hub for low-cost power.","\u201CA number of locations that have access power and want to find a way to bring jobs to those communities, some of that\u2019s being advertised right now by some countries,\u201D said Sullivan. \u201CBut we might find Northern Canada ending up being the Holy Grail of Bitcoin mining four years from now.\u201D","$CORZ Full Fiscal Year 2023 Highlights","\u2013 19,274 bitcoin mined in our data centers; 13,762 by self-mining, more than any other publicly listed miner in North America, and an estimated 5,512 for our hosting clients\n\u2013 Total revenue of $502.4 million\n\u2013 Operated total hash rate of\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/ylVHPyJRW5","\u2014 Core Scientific (@Core_Scientific) March 13, 2024","","Even if Bitcoin mining operations were to emerge in uncharted territories, Sullivan stated that the existing leaders will probably pilot the projects with the assistance of local parties.","\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of nuances to running the game,\u201D he said. \u201CYou learn how to design these buildings much more efficiently from experience.\u201D","\u201CThe local parties give us the conditions like the temperature, the humidity, the wind speeds, what direction is the parcel facing, and we can design a facility that is optimized for all those weather conditions,\u201D claimed Sullivan. \u201CThat\u2019s something you can\u2019t just learn in your first build.\u201D","Adam Sullivan also discussed the potential impact of the Bitcoin halving on its price, noting, \u201CWe are definitely going to see more volatility post-halving.\u201D He mentioned the role of ETFs in providing broader access to Bitcoin, which could eventually help stabilize fluctuations over time.","Addressing external factors, Sullivan said, \u201CPolicies from the Fed (Federal Reserve) during an election year could boost Bitcoin prices if inflation rises\u2026But I think there\u2019s a real possibility here where we just stay flat post halving.\u201D","Concluding his insights, he suggested that the long-term prospects for Bitcoin are likely positive, saying, \u201CEasier access to Bitcoin through ETFs could lead to greater price increases as more financial institutions engage.\u201D","\u201CAnd for Core Scientific, we believe we\u2019re very well prepared for this upcoming halving. We have a plan over the next four years that we\u2019re executing on to remain a very competitive Bitcoin miner in 2028,\u201D said the CEO."],"entity":[{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CORZ Full Fiscal Year 2023 Highlights","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$502.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2028","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"North America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2012","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sullivan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"South America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Adam Sullivan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Northern Canada","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fed (Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Holy Grail of Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin halving","Mining"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
