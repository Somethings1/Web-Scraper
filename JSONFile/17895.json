Everything the Post alleges in its story is the exact opposite. The $282 million that was withdrawn from Genesis in August 2022 was in fact Earn\u2026","Following the collapse of FTX, which significantly impacted the crypto market, Genesis froze customer withdrawals.","In January this year, Genesis Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York. Gemini has since filed a claim in the bankruptcy court seeking $1.1 billion on behalf of its Earn program users.","Over the months following the initial withdrawal freeze, Gemini, Genesis, and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) engaged in settlement negotiations, which sometimes turned public with disputes involving DCG\u2019s founder, Barry Silbert, and the Winklevoss twins.","While a tentative agreement was reached in February, it was never finalized.","Mediated negotiations that followed failed to yield a mutually agreeable settlement, leading Gemini to sue DCG for fraud in July.","In the lawsuit, Gemini claimed that it had attempted to terminate the Earn program in mid-October 2022, and one of its founders had a face-to-face meeting with Silbert, who sought to address concerns about insolvency. A DCG spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as a \u201Cpublicity stunt\u201D and denied any wrongdoing.","Adding complexity to the situation, Genesis sued its parent company, DCG, in September for over $620 million in unpaid loans. ","Both Genesis and Gemini also faced charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January, alleging that the Earn program constituted an unregistered sale of securities. "],"entity":[{"type":"$282 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The New York Post","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Post","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"mid-October 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$280 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Winklevoss twins","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cameron Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$620 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Gemini"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
