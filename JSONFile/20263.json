Hashes that match *future* scans.","Don't catalogue eyeballs. https:\/\/t.co\/uAk0NYGeZu","\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) October 23, 2021","","According to the Foundation, privacy and security were top priorities in the Orb\u2019s construction.","\u201COne privacy-critical step is sending individual data from the Orb to World App for a feature called \u2018Personal Custody\u2019. Individuals can use this self-custodied data, for example, for Face Authentication in World App,\u201D they stated.","The Foundation added that it may reduce the frequency in which users must visit the orb to re-verify their identity in the future.","A white-box audit report by Trail of Bits found that the Orb collects no personally identifiable information from its users besides an Iris code. It also said that it collects no information from users\u2019 devices that have the World App installed.","\u201CFurther audits are underway and, combined with open sourcing, reflect the Foundation\u2019s aim to maintain a continuously high level of transparency around privacy and security,\u201D the Foundation stated.","The WLD token has risen $3.45 to $8.16 over the past three months. In February, the foundation revealed that World App\u2019s daily active user count has crossed 1 million."],"entity":[{"type":"Edward Snowden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MIT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Worldcoin Orb on Github","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 23, 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Worldcoin Orb","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Worldcoin Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.45","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$8.16","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Data privacy","Sam Altman","Worldcoin Orb"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
