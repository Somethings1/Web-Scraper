Last year, 24.4% of the population was reported to have made a purchase with Bitcoin.","","Among those surveyed, nearly half (49.7%) made a Bitcoin transaction one to three times, while 20% used it 10 or more times. The main expenditures in Bitcoin were for groceries (22.9%) and supermarkets (20.9%), followed by veterinary clinics (15%).","The survey also revealed changes in perception regarding the impact of Bitcoin as a legal tender. In 2023, 6.8% of respondents felt their family\u2019s life improved during the past year due to Bitcoin being legal tender. This is a 3.8% increase from the results in 2022.","However, more than a third (34.3%) believed that the overall economic situation in the country improved. This was primarily attributed to a decline in crime (24.3%), with only 0.5% associating Bitcoin with economic improvement.","According to the survey in 2022, only 24.4% of respondents reported using BTC as a means of payment since the country\u2019s government recognized it as legal tender. Despite the government\u2019s efforts to promote Bitcoin adoption, 95% of respondents stated that their lives \u201Cstayed the same\u201D or \u201C[have] gotten worse\u201D since Bitcoin became legal tender.","El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin. He has initiated various Bitcoin-related projects, including proposing the establishment of a \u201CBitcoin City\u201D with nominal tax rates set at 0%. The government has also made significant Bitcoin purchases using the national budget, amounting to over $107 million.","In El Salvador, they continue to build Bitcoin city near the Conchagua volcano \u2013 a settlement for crypto investors, the construction and economy of which would be entirely based on cryptocurrency. pic.twitter.com\/37UMdYbmai","\u2014 Half Moon Bay üåö (@halfmoonbay_vmv) January 16, 2024","","Interestingly, the survey did not include questions about the Salvadoran government\u2019s BTC investments. In 2023, 77.1% of respondents expressed the desire for the government to stop \u201Cspending public money on Bitcoin.\u201D The overall profit of the government\u2019s BTC portfolio is around 0.57% at the time of writing.","","In September 2021, El Salvador\u2019s government passed the \u201CBitcoin Law,\u201D making the cryptocurrency legal tender in the country. The move aimed to provide financial access to the unbanked population by allowing anyone with a phone and internet connection to access a central-bank-backed cryptocurrency wallet.","However, a study revealed several key issues. Results showed that the primary demographic eager to adopt BTC as a currency is \u201Cyoung, educated men with bank accounts.\u201D The research identified privacy and transparency concerns as significant barriers to adoption. This is surprising given that decentralized currencies aim to address these concerns.","It was also noted that initial adoption costs were substantial. However, benefits increased as more people adopted the technology. Additionally, resistance from businesses was identified as a factor hindering adoption.","Contrary to some hypotheses that suggested crypto could benefit the poor and unbanked the most, the study found that the already wealthy and banked were the primary users of crypto in El Salvador. This finding challenges the notion that cryptocurrencies inherently serve the interests of an underserved population.","The study also pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s lack of privacy contradicted claims made by its supporters. Some argued that Bitcoin\u2019s system could evade surveillance by traditional banks. On the other hand, law enforcement authorities adapted to using other checks and balances to track, monitor, and potentially apprehend Bitcoin users.","Meanwhile, the government of El Salvador has been bolstering its efforts to increase crypto investment within the nation.","In December 2023, it was reported that the country had initiated a fresh citizenship-by-investment initiative. The process would grant residency visas and citizenship to individuals who invest $1 million in Bitcoin or Tether within the nation."],"entity":[{"type":"El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"3.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"September 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"77.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"24.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$107 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"0%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January 16, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"6.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.57%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"34.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"95%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"49.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"22.9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"20.9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"24.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jos√© Sime√≥n Ca√±as Central American University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","btc","El Salvador"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
