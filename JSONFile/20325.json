And the Andorran government has been keen to adopt a number of pro-crypto policies in recent months.","Last year, it made its first moves to regulate crypto operators that have a base in the country. And in April, per the news outlet Diari Andorra, the ruling Democrats for Andorra party put forward a proposal to \u201Callow the state to create its own token.\u201D","The draft law made mention of what its authors called \u201Cprogrammable digital sovereign money\u201D that could \u201Cserve as a means of payment\u201D and would be issued by the \u201Ccentral bank or a sovereign government authority.\u201D It would also be \u201Cintended for use by the general public,\u201D and could be used to make government bond issuances.","The proposal makes mention of \u201Cblockchain technology\u201D and, perhaps more pertinently, also looks to grant private businesses permission to launch their own digital tokens \u2013 cryptoassets in all but name \u2013 under certain conditions.","The proposal was put out for public consultation. But last month, the same newspaper reported, its architects hit the pause button on the plan. Instead of accepting it completely, politicians instead decided to approve \u201Ctokenization\u201D in \u201Cclosed ecosystems,\u201D such as \u201Cski resorts.\u201D As such, coins could not be publicly traded or listed on exchanges \u2013 and would have more in common with \u201CDisney Dollars\u201D than with bitcoin (BTC).","The revised bill, now the Digital Assets Law, dictates that cryptoassets \u201Ccannot be [used] as a legal tender in the Principality,\u201D and appears to have been diluted heavily at the request of the Andorran Financial Authority (AFA), the top financial regulator.","The AFA claimed that it \u201Crequired more resources to be able to carry out the necessary controls\u201D on cryptoassets.","However, the proponents of the bill will be back for a second bite of the cherry. The terms of the act require the architects to return with a \u201Cnew bill\u201D before a period of 15 months is over.","And this new proposal will contain details on the prosed \u201Cissuance of digital assets that can be considered financial instruments.\u201D This seemingly opens the door for a cryptoasset to attain legal tender status, El Salvador-style.","The media outlet remarked that this delay would provide \u201Croom for maneuver\u201D for politicians who wanted to keep track of how European Union regulators police the crypto sector and \u201Cthus be able to follow in their footsteps.\u201D","But some in the private sector would prefer not to wait \u2013 and have proposed ambitious-sounding plans to follow other more maverick nations\u2019 leads.","A more recent proposal from the Andorra-based crypto firm 21 Million drew up the case for adopting BTC in the principality.","The firm remarked that adopting bitcoin could allow the Treasury to \u201Copen a lot of economic activities,\u201D as it would \u201Callow Andorran banks and businesses to transact outside\u201D bank messaging networks like SWIFT. Instead, parties could \u201Csettle transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, while allowing Andorran businesses and citizens to make daily transactions on the Lightning network.\u201D","The firm explained that bitcoin would \u201Cprovide additional resilience to legacy channels while preserving Andorra\u2019s financial independence.\u201D","The company\u2019s CEO urged politicians to act fast, explaining:","\u201CBy attracting innovative entrepreneurs who want to enjoy a high-quality European lifestyle in a safe environment, the country could climb up some more ranks towards the most prosperous nations on earth, while remaining in control of its future, and that\u2019s great!\u201D","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Crypto Community Unimpressed as ECB President Pushes for Digital Euro with Privacy \u2018of the Highest Standard\u2019\n\u2013 CBDCs \u2018An Investment\u2019 to Protect the Fiat System, Cash Will Disappear, Swedish Central Banker Says\n\n\u2013 El Salvadoran Government to Back New Token, Bukele Says \u2018Don\u2019t Panic\u2019 About Falling Bitcoin Prices\n\u2013 Central Africa Rolls Out Sango Coin Amid Transparency, Credibility Worries\n\n\u2013 Spanish Crypto Holders to Be \u2018Burdened\u2019 with Fresh Crypto Declaration Rules\n\u2013 French Lawmaker Releases New Report to Push for Crypto Legislation"],"entity":[{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"France","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"New Token","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Principality","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ECB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Euro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Disney Dollars","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvadoran Government","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Community Unimpressed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andorra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"European Union","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Diari Andorra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Andorran Financial Authority (AFA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Legislation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Spain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fiat System","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AFA","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","Blockchain","CBDC","Cryptocurrency","Lightning Network","Regulation"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
