XMR Plummets, Yet This Bitcoin Protocol Just Hit $10.3 Million in Funding","category":["Industry Talk "],"content":["After a tumultuous Binance announcement, the leading privacy token Monero has seen its price plummet. This XMR analysis takes a look at whether Monero is doomed to fall even further.","Monero token\u2019s huge price drop has been attributed to an announcement from Binance, which yesterday spooked XMR markets after revealing plans to de-list the dark-web favorite cryptocurrency from public trading on the exchange.","The decision comes following Monero\u2019s refusal to comply with increased KYC requirements due to the arrival on more stringent Western cryptocurrency regulations, which as a popular privacy oriented token, XMR seeks to avoid.","Are we looking at $600 $XMR? pic.twitter.com\/n2AquWnTiP","\u2014 SirJaɱzAlot (@MgkMshrmBrkfst) February 6, 2024","","Crypto community sentiment remains surprisingly bullish despite the sell-off, with traders commenting on XMR\u2019s commitment to continued privacy as a compelling fundamental factor that could be seen as bullish for XMR\u2019s continued future use as a currency.","As XMR price recoils from the aggressive dumping move, Monero token is currently trading at a market price of $127.1 (representing a 24-hour change of +20.49%).","This comes following the catastrophic -39% sell-off move Yesterday, which saw XMR price hammer down through the vital support of moving averages, in a resounding market panic that caught bedrock support around the lower trendline at $101.","Now trading back above $126.60, a historic support level with precedents from June 2023 and November 2022, XMR price appears to be past the worst of the dumping move.","","As the market stabilizes, Monero (XMR) is setting sights on recovery, with investors aiming for the 20-day moving average (DMA) at $156.10.","The resilience shown during the recent sell-off positions XMR for a potential rebound from the lower trendline, fueled by optimistic indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to a bullish 36.57, indicating the price may bounce back from its oversold condition.","However, concerns arise with the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicating a significant loss of momentum at -4.0, contrasting the positive outlook from the RSI.","In summary, while the initial price drop may have ceased, Monero\u2019s path to recovery is laden with challenges. The absence of trading volume from Binance could significantly test XMR\u2019s short-term price movements.","","To the upside, XMR is targeting a recovery move to higher support at $136.40 (a potential +6.4%).","While downside risk could see XMR targeting a drop back to lower support at $126.60 (a possible -1.25%).","XMR price analysis therefore leaves Monero with a risk: reward ratio of 5.13 \u2013 a strong entry dominated by recovery on the short-time frame.","But while Monero token shifts into recovery mode, a more strategic play emerges ahead of the Bitcoin halving event in April, with viral-momentum fuelling growth in the Bitcoin Minetrix presale.","","Dive into the innovative world of Bitcoin Minetrix and its pioneering stake-to-mine system \u2013 as the skyrocketing presale smashes +$10,391,923 raised \u2013 with the latest Stage 24 just kicking off!","Offering an enticing 75% Staking APY, Bitcoin Minetrix provides a platform where users can buy, stake, and then watch as the rewards start accumulating.","The true essence of passive income in the crypto world has never been this accessible.","With the Bitcoin Minetrix approach, gone are the days of heavy initial capital and navigating complex mining contracts.","Since the 2021 Bull Run, Bitcoin mining has defied expectations by undertaking something of a renaissance in network growth.","Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Rate (a measure of the total amount of computational power directed at mining Bitcoin blocks) has surged to an incredible all-time high of 525 Exahashes per second (EH\/S).",""," ","The significant growth in the Bitcoin mining sector has been driven by the expansion of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms\u2019 operations.","Marathon, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin miner, reported a Q3 2023 average hash rate of 14.2 EH\/s, a 500% increase year-over-year, accounting for about 4% of the total network hash. This capacity enabled them to mine approximately 1153 BTC per month, valued at $42.2 million USD.","Riot Platforms achieved a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH\/s, mining around 368 BTC per month, worth $13.3 million USD. Riot anticipates growing its operations to 20.2 EH\/s by summer 2024.","However, the record-high Bitcoin network hash rate, while enhancing network security and profitability for miners, raises concerns about moving away from Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original vision of decentralization.","Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history.","A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking 55.79% of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools.","AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%).","This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third-place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.","","This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin.","Currently standing at 70,440,798,833,881 \u2013 it has never been harder for individual participants to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining.","","This challenge of heightened network difficulty, fuelled by increased competition and centralization of mining power, has created the need for new solutions for the retail investor to participate in Bitcoin mining \u2013 both for network decentralization and preserving Bitcoin as a profitable activity for the individual.","Enter Bitcoin Minetrix, which was launched to deliver secure and transparent Bitcoin mining rewards for the retail investor through an innovative, decentralized Bitcoin cloud mining approach.","","In sum, Bitcoin Minetrix is set to redefine the Bitcoin landscape.
