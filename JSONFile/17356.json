His analysis showed that Bitcoin prices tend to follow a repeating pattern, suggesting a bullish trajectory.","The seasoned trader analyzed Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior in a thread on X, where he classified the asset into three phases: Hump-Slump, Bump-Rump, and Pump-Dump.","According to the chart presented by Brandt, the current Bitcoin market has completed the first and second phases and is in the third phase.","He noted that the \u201Cdump\u201D part of the third stage had taken place while the \u201Cpump\u201D phase was yet to materialize, suggesting a forthcoming BTC price increase.","His deduction of a potential major Bitcoin price move comes amid a bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market, largely due to the news of the geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran.","Brandt\u2019s analysis offers a potentially deeper perspective on the recent trajectory of BTC\u2019s price, however.","For instance, when Israel launched a retaliatory attack on Iran overnight, Bitcoin briefly dipped to $59K from its prior price of $63.4K before recovering to $65K. This rapid shift in trend has also fueled gains in other cryptocurrencies, indicating the possibility of an altcoin rally.","Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data indicates that large Bitcoin holders (crypto whales) may have used the price dip to accumulate more cryptocurrencies at a discount.","Earlier this week, Cryptonews.com reported a transfer of over 27.7K BTC ($1.75 billion) sent into accumulation wallet addresses between April 16 and April 17. This exceeded the previous record of 25,500 BTC (almost $1.6 billion) sent to such wallets on March 23, when the Bitcoin price was around $63.5K.","Additionally, the impending Bitcoin halving event strengthens Brandt\u2019s Bitcoin price prediction. The halving is designed to reduce incentives for mining new blocks, thereby slowing down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created.","JUST IN: 100 blocks remain until #Bitcoin halving. pic.twitter.com\/w6NkuxlqF5","\u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) April 19, 2024","","Bitcoin halving has a history of driving up the demand and price of BTC.","Peter Brandt\u2019s optimism for a BTC price increase aligns with market analysis insights from other experts as well, including pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital.","The trader claimed that the current dip period of BTC, which is dubbed as the third or \u201CDump\u201D stage in Brandt\u2019s projection, might be the last opportunity for Bitcoin holders to purchase BTC at a relatively low value before post-halving sets in.","In a post on X, Rekt Capital explained that recent BTC price movement features are similar to previous Bitcoin halving cycles, during which price declines gave way to rallies.","#BTC","3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving","1.
