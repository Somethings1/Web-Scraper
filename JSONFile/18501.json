The latest figure marks the lowest recorded since CertiK began tracking such incidents in 2021, as flash loan attacks and private critical hacks decreased.","","#CertiKStatsAlert üö®","Combining all the incidents in April we\u2019ve confirmed ~$25.7m lost to exploits, hacks and scams.","The lowest figure we\u2019ve recorded, dating back to 2021.","A 141% decrease from March","Exit scams: ~$4.3m\nFlash loans: ~$129k\nExploits: ~$21m","More details below pic.twitter.com\/zfSh8mabzJ","\u2014 CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) April 30, 2024","","According to the report, only $25.7 million was lost in attacks throughout the month, marking the lowest amount since CertiK began tracking such data in 2021.","The firm highlighted that April\u2019s total losses represented a 141% decrease from the previous month. Breaking down the figures, CertiK reported that approximately $21 million was attributed to exploits, with only three breaches exceeding $1 million in damages.","Flash loan attacks accounted for $129,000 in losses, with the largest incident causing $55,000 in damages. This marked the lowest incidence of flash loan attacks since February 2022, and $4.3 million was lost to exit scams.","The decline was primarily attributed to a reduction in private vital compromises. In March, 11 attacks against protocols via private key compromises were reported, whereas April witnessed only 3 such incidents.","Despite the overall positive trend, several major hacks and scams still occurred during the month, resulting in substantial losses. For instance, memecoin CondomSol\u2019s presale address on the Solana network was exploited, causing approximately $933,000 in losses for unsuspecting users.","Among the bigger incidents, the attack on the FixedFloat project stood out as the most prominent. It marked the second breach by the same attackers who compromised the project in February 2024.","Exit scams ranked as the second most financially damaging exploit, with losses totaling $4.3 million. Instant loans followed, accounting for $129,000 in compromised funds.","CertiK clarified that the¬†suspected¬†rug pull by crypto casino ZKasino was not included in the report due to unconfirmed details. Although not yet labeled as a scam by CertiK, the platform noted that it would update its figures if ZKasino\u2019s nefarious actions were confirmed.","ZKasino transferred funds to the Lido protocol on April 22, sparking outrage among its users. It is estimated that approximately $32 million has been lost in this suspected scam, however, with the ZKasino team allegedly collecting 10,515 ETH during the ZKAS token presale.","‚ö†Ô∏è Hackers have successfully exploited the smart contracts of the now-defunct DeFi lending protocol Yield Protocol, draining¬†crypto assets amounting to approximately $181,000.#YieldProtocol #Exploithttps:\/\/t.co\/9VepY77KNs","\u2014 Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 30, 2024","","Shortly after the issuance of CertiK\u2019s report, the decentralized finance app Yield Protocol¬†fell victim to an exploit, resulting in $181,000 in losses. Despite the developer\u2019s official closure of Yield Protocol, some users could still interact with its smart contracts due to their immutable nature.","Looking at broader trends, Immunefi reported that the cryptocurrency industry¬†lost¬†$336 million to hacks and fraud in the first quarter of 2024. This figure reflects a huge decrease compared to previous years, as in 2023, hackers stole an estimated $1.8 billion, half of the $4 billion recorded in 2022.","Data from DefiLlama¬†revealed¬†that as of April 1, total losses from cryptocurrency hacks surpassed $7.7 billion, despite a 23% decline in incidents during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the previous year.
