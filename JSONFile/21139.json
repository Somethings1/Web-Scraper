If ETF-related inflows materialise as we expect, we think an end-2025 level closer to USD 200,000 is possible.\u201D","Previously, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said Bitcoin price could reach all-time high in 2024 in an interview with CNBC. van Eck also illustrated the similarity between the performances of Bitcoin and gold in 2023.","\u201CThey both peaked in 2021; they\u2019ve both been rallying this year, obviously Bitcoin way more than gold for obvious reasons,\u201D said van Eck.","Other major Bitcoin ETF issuers like Galaxy and Bitwise have also predicted Bitcoin to pump as an imminent impact of the pending approval. The SEC is expected to decide on the applications on Jan. 10 while the spot Bitcoin ETFs may start trading as soon as Jan. 11 if approved."],"entity":[{"type":"VanEck CEO Jan van Eck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$50","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitwise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$34 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.2 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$200,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.86 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2004","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 2004","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SPDR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$88 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$130 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"ETP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Head of Crypto Research Geoffrey Kendrick","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GLD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Standard Chartered Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Standard Chartered","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin ETF","Standard Chartered"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
