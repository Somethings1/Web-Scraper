The price is still down by almost 9% in a day. Ethereum (ETH) recovered from USD 2,051 to USD 2,839, trimming its daily losses to less than 17%. Other coins from the top 10 list are down by 13%-29% in a day.","\u201CThis will feel very uncomfortable for many traders and investors who are new to this high volatility area of the market and rightfully so, we\u2019ve seen a lot of higher leverage positions be liquidated in a short span of time,\u201D Jeffery Wang, Head of America\u2019s at the Amber Group, said in an emailed comment.","This was \u201Ca large flushout,\u201D Wang added, and if the market wants to continue higher it was \u201Clikely necessary to remove some of the froth from overleveraged positions.\u201D","The next few days will be important to see how overall sentiment is, \u201Ca term we\u2019ve heard repeatedly over the past 6 months is many traders wanted the opportunity to buy lower, ie buy the dip, so with the opportunity now upon us will see if people do put new money to work or if their stance has changed.\u201D","In light of this massive drop across crypto markets, many in the Cryptoverse, such as FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, have noted large liquidations across the board.","So that's why it reached 30k. ATH liquidations of bitcoin longs pic.twitter.com\/oFEb0gL6Kg","USD 8.7bn worth of trading positions (790,625 in total) in the crypto derivatives market were liquidated in the past 24 hours, per Bybt.com data. USD 3.7bn of these are trading positions in BTC. Ethereum traders lost over USD 2.3bn.","\u201CThe last 48 hours in the markets were bloody \u2013 really bloody,\u201D wrote Anthony Sassano, SetProtocol product marketing manager and author of the Ethereum-focused newsletter The Daily Gwei, and ETH fell \u201Cmuch lower than almost anyone thought it was going to drop.\u201D","That said, Sassano suggested that investors might want to \u201Cthink in years, not days.\u201D","Also, per Ju Ki-young, CEO of crypto analytics provider CryptoQuant, people should wait for whales to stop deposits for selling in the next few hours. \u201CDon\u2019t try to be a hero who captures the bottom,\u201D he said. \u201CBe safe.\u201D","On the other hand, some of those who wanted to purchase bitcoin and other crypto found themselves unable to. \u201CThere is nothing more frustrating than trying to buy bitcoin on sale but every exchange struggling under the high traffic,\u201D said prominent crypto investor Anthony Pompliano.

Some of these reportedly include Blockfolio, BlockFi, Cryptowatch, Binance desktop, Bitpanda, FTX, Bitstamp, Kraken, Huobi, and a number of others.","One of the major exchanges experiencing issues (once again) was Coinbase, who said: \u201CWe\u2019re seeing some issues on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro and we\u2019re aware some features may not be functioning completely normal.\u201D They added that customers are experiencing some issues with logging in, seeing their balances, and trading, but that funds are safe.","There's a difference.\n\nEveryone in the queue to the bank is trying to get money out.\n\nSome people in crypto are trying to put money IN at the same time as others taking out.","\u201CWith hundreds of projects getting built across various blockchains, key crypto segments like DeFi up at USD 71B of total value locked, NFTs getting their fair share of attention in mainstream media, Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain in the world, getting multiple efficiency updates and moving to proof-of-stake in the upcoming months, the markets are bound to make a quick comeback sooner,\u201D Ganesh Swami, CEO and Co-Founder of Covalent, a blockchain data provider, said in an emailed comment.","\u201CMore than anything, however, what this undeniably large correction and those before it prove is that the crypto market is resilient, that it\u2019s a long-term game ill-suited to the weak-handed,\u201D Antoni Trenchev, Co-founder and Managing Partner of major crypto lender Nexo, said.","Â ","Also, according to him, \u201Ca lot\u201D of their clients roll out of BTC into ETH because, \u201Con the surface, Bitcoin is now where ETH was a few months back: it hit USD 2,000 in February and then failed to reconquer that territory for more than a month.\u201D","Meanwhile, Gunnar Jaerv, Chief Operating Officer of First Digital Trust, a Hong Kong-based digital asset custodian, stressed that it is paramount that those in the crypto space spend sufficient time researching facts before believing any social media discourse, especially given the reactivity of so many of the comments that have driven the crash of both BTC and ETH.","At the same time, the BTC advocate and Quantum Economics analyst Jason Deane stressed that Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals, network, and objectives remain entirely intact.","\u201CMusk\u2019s musings are, ultimately, irrelevant to any of these factors. He can influence the markets temporarily in terms of value, but he can\u2019t change any other factors,\u201D he said, claiming that the recovery is \u201Cinevitable.\u201D","He also suggested that new BTC investors should understand their own strategy better.","\u201CYou\u2019ll find your level of comfort is directly proportional to how clear you are on what you\u2019re doing, what your level of exposure is and, most importantly, what confidence you have in what you\u2019re buying (or selling). If you\u2019re feeling stressed and worried, something in that mix is wrong,\u201D he said.","Another Quantum Economics analyst Lou Kerner has shared his own BTC investment strategy.","\u201CSo I dollar-cost average. It eliminates the effects of investor psychology and market timing on my bitcoin holdings. I simply committed to a certain dollar amount I\u2019m going to invest on a daily basis, and I set it and forget it. When the market goes down, I get to buy bitcoin cheaper, and cheaper, as has been happening for the last 10 days,\u201D he said.","At the same time, some big investors, such as the MicroStrategy boss, Michael Saylor, and Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk also chimed in. Saylor said that they did not nor plan to sell their BTC, while Musk suggested that the company has \u201Cdiamond hands,\u201D meaning that they are not selling their BTC now. According to Musk, credit for this goes to their Master of Coin \u2013 the Chief Financial Officer of the car manufacturer, Zachary Kirkhorn.","Entities I control have now acquired 111,000 #BTC and have not sold a single satoshi. #Bitcoin Forever.","Â ","Are you referring to #bitcoin or Doge?","Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer at Ark Investment Management, a major investor in Tesla and Coinbase, told Bloomberg TV that BTC is \u201Con sale\u201D right now, although it is not necessarily at a bottom. Also, she estimates that BTC will hit USD 500,000 eventually.","____","Obvious warning signs of pain coming a month ago:\n\n\u2013 ETHheads gloating about flippening\n\u2013 \"DogeArmy\" talking about HODLing Doge ðŸ¤¦\n\u2013 Mark Cuban becomes self appointed \"crypto\" expert\n\nThe pain is necessary to purge this nonsense.","Unprecedented opportunity in the midst of a #bitcoin bull market.","#BTC\n\nThe reason prices are not much higher right now is b\/c MOST exchanges absolutely SUCK\n\nI don't think that most people have any clue of what is happening right now to pause price\n\nSickening!","Literally the worst gas spike I've ever seen. pic.twitter.com\/SEYKsx8711","Bitcoin correction update: -53% from last month's high. $BTC pic.twitter.com\/utX4Puaxgb","This was not a black swan event.
