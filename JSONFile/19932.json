The silver trust is another BlackRock-owned product and gives exposure to the day-to-day movement of the price of silver bullion. The SLV trust has approximately $9,787,865,530 AUM just shy of $10 billion.","Bitcoin ETFs are moving up the Commodity ETFs leaderboard.","Note the YTD performance difference of $IBIT $FBTC $ARKB $BITB vs. $GLD $IAU $SLV $GLDM $PDBC $SGOL $DBC $USO $UNG pic.twitter.com\/fg3vl4AJTj","\u2014 HODL15Capital ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@HODL15Capital) March 3, 2024","","Â ","Hector McNeil, co-CEO and the co-founder of HANetf, a firm which markets and distributes exchange-traded products, told Cryptonews, that it is unsurprising IBIT has overtaken the silver trust.","\u201CThe success of IBIT I think reflects how hot bitcoin is as an asset class driven by the excitement and frenzy around the US ETF approvals,\u201D explains McNeil.","BlackRock is a global powerhouse, the world\u2019s largest asset management, with $10 trillion in assets as of December 31. Unsurprisingly, the firm entering Bitcoin with a new Spot Bitcoin product has triggered another bull run.","\u201CTons of competition and masses of marketing dollars being spent. As long as the price momentum keeps going then I see the AUM rising. This is both down to Bitcoin price as well as inflows,\u201D said McNeil.","Commenting on the IBIT ETF overtaking the iShares Silver Trust in terms of AUM, McNeil explains, \u201CPrecious metals have had a good price run over the last year but nowhere near the frenzy of Bitcoin so doesn\u2019t surprise me it\u2019s surpassing the silver trust.\u201D","On Thursday, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin product trading under the ticker symbol \u201CGBTC\u201D faced a sluggish trading session, marked by net outflows nearing $600m. This day marked the second largest outflow since Jan. 11. Total GBTC outflows since Jan. 11 now amount to $8,406.3m.","\u201CIt\u2019s great to witness from a capital markets perspective that [BlackRock] iShares has superseded and replaced Grayscale\u2019s GBTC from being the main trading vehicle for Bitcoin,\u201D Laurent Kssis, a crypto expert on trading and ETFs at CEC Capital told Cryptonews.","\u201CWe always said the GBTC product was substandard for institutional investors but the first one to make it on the secondary market through a loophole in the rules to admit products on OTC markets,\u201D explains Kssis.","Back in July 2013 the Winklevoss twins first filed for a Bitcoin ETF but this was rejected over and over again.Â ","\u201CIt has taken 10 years after the filing of the S1 from the Winklevoss brothers to get where we are and we are still scratching the surface where many trading platforms are still holding off and deliberating from allowing their clients to trade the ETFs \u2014 it\u2019s inevitable \u2014 and this will allow a second layer of investment yet not seen so far,\u201D said Kssis.","On Wednesday, it emerged that Morgan Stanley is considering adding spot Bitcoin ETFs to its brokerage platform and is currently in the process of conducting due diligence, according to a CoinDesk report citing two sources familiar with the matter.","During press time Bitcoin was trading at around $63,755. \u200B\u200BBitcoin\u2019s price prediction remains a focal point for investors as Bitcoin is climbing to $63,800, an increase of nearly 3.25% on Monday.
