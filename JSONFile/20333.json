But when you sell BTC you get paid Tether. To get actual cash for Bitcoin you must accept a huge discount.\u201D","Unsurprisingly, he was heavily criticized for his posts by the crypto community, some of which jokingly claimed that Schiff himself is a BTC buyer looking for sellers. Others are \u2018begging\u2019 the crypto critic to let them know when and where they can buy BTC below $10,000.","Despite this, Schiff continued urging people to abandon the world\u2019s most popular crypto, saying:","\u201CGBTC is trading at a 46% discount now. New record. Something is definitely going on. Bitcoin is in real trouble. Get out while you can!\u201D","He went on to discuss possible reasons behind the lower NAV, saying that GBTC may have loaned out its Bitcoin and the borrower can\u2019t repay the loan, or the BTC was stored with a custodian who lost it \u2013 but that the NAV could be \u201Creally a lot lower.\u201D","Today the #Grayscale Bitcoin Trust traded at a 43% discount to its NAV. With #Bitcoin trading at $16,700, shareholders of $GBTC were willing to sell their Bitcoin for the equivalent of $9,500. What does that tell you about retail and institutional investor confidence in Bitcoin?","That said, cryptoasset manager Grayscale Investments stated on Friday that \u201Cthe laws, regulations, and documents that define Grayscale\u2019s digital asset products prohibit the digital assets underlying the products from being lent, borrowed, or otherwise encumbered.\u201D","All digital assets that underlie Grayscale\u2019s digital asset products it added, are stored under the custody of Coinbase Custody Trust Company, stating that:","\u201CTo be perfectly clear: the BTC underlying Grayscale Bitcoin Trust are owned by GBTC and GBTC alone.\u201D","And in their announcement on this topic, the company claimed that,","\u201CCustody of the digital assets underlying Grayscale\u2019s digital asset products is unaffected, and our products\u2019 digital assets remain safe and secure. \u201C","Schiff also looked back on one of his older BTC-related tweets, saying that it didn\u2019t take long for his prediction to come true. The tweet in question, posted in July, argued that the need to sell BTC would worsen as the recession deepens and as \u201Cmany HODLers lose their jobs, especially those working for soon-to-be bankrupt blockchain companies.\u201D","Schiff also claimed that,","\u201CThe lion\u2019s share of the selling has not even started yet. Bitcoin still has a long way to fall.\u201D","He also turned his focus to the topic of the month \u2013 the disastrous collapse of the FTX exchange, stating that the former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was \u2018obviously\u2019 a conman. ","I never looked into #SBF as I never even considered investing in #FTX. But had I done ten minutes of due diligence the red flags would have been obvious. That so many in #crypto were so easily duped by an obvious conman calls into question their judgement on everything crypto.","Schiff is an outspoken stock broker and the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, who evangelizes gold-buying as an investment strategy, but claims that BTC is a scam. He has become pretty infamous in the world of crypto Twitter over the years, where he often trolls BTC advocates.","This prolonged downturn in the crypto markets has given him plenty of opportunity to again declare crypto dead and to urge people to purchase gold. ","\u201CBitcoin mania is over. Buy gold,\u201D he said today.","The supply of #CryptoCurrencies is soaring as demand for #cryptos is collapsing. Over the past year the supply of cryptos grew by around 50% to almost 22,000. But during that same time period the combined market capitalization fell by about 73%. #Bitcoin mania is over. Buy #gold.","He further claimed that the value of stablecoins would \u201Csoon\u201D exceed the value of Bitcoin.","With the market capitalization of all #crypto tokens below $793 billion, the value of the two largest dollar-backed stable coins represents 14% of the market. That's 80% of the value of #Etherum, the 2nd largest. Soon the value of stable coins will exceed the value of #Bitcoin.","At 10:00 UTC on Monday morning, BTC was trading at $16,119. It is down 3% in a day, over 1% in a week, 16% in a month, and 73% in a year.","BTC 30-day price chart:","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin Billionaire Michael Saylor Gets Into Twitter Spat with Gold Bug Peter Schiff\n\u2013 Peter Schiff Gets an Unexpected Lesson in the Benefits of Bitcoin as Banking Woes Bite\n\n\u2013 Billion-Dollar Crypto Fund Grayscale Refuses to Post Proof-of-Reserves \u2013 Next Firm to Collapse?\n\u2013 Grayscale Ramps Up Efforts Against SEC For Rejecting Bitcoin ETF\n\n\u2013 Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert Kiyosaki Calls FTX Founder \u2018Bernie Madoff of Crypto\u2019, Says \u2018Bitcoin is Not the Problem\u2019\n\u2013 Binance Now Holds Nearly 600,000 Bitcoin Worth $9.6 Billion \u2013 Largest BTC Holder in the World?"],"entity":[{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peter Schiff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase Custody Trust Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$793 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$16,700","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Schiff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$9.6 Billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Euro Pacific Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"43%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"NAV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bernie Madoff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"73%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$GBTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$10,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"14%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"$9,500","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$16,119","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Dad Robert Kiyosaki Calls FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Forecast","FTX","Market","Regulation","Stablecoin"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
