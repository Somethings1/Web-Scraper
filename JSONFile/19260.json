This arguably provides legitimacy not only to him as a crypto and finance figure, but to his companies as well, placing them on \u2018the respectable firms\u2019 list.  ","The billionaire made the above-stated comments in an interview with Bloomberg, where he was asked about the next big risk that could threaten the world in the coming years.","\u201COne thing that has seemed particularly important to me is how we handle future pandemics,\u201D SBF said, noting that the world was not ready when COVID-19 hit.","He said there was no coordination among countries in terms of what the response should be. Therefore, he expressed concern that there could be a \u201Crepeat of what happened\u201D if another pandemic hits, killing many people while also bringing the economy to a halt amid the chaos and lockdowns.","\u201CThe biggest problem is that there weren\u2019t that many lessons we really learned as a society,\u201D the billionaire said. \u201CWe are in much the same place we were beforehand. There\u2019s almost no discourse about a future pandemic and almost no momentum.\u201D","The COVID-19 outbreak sent shock waves across global markets. Not only did it lead to supply chain bottlenecks, but it also resulted in a massive increase in monetary supply as countries attempted to nullify the impacts of the devastating economic hit with relief packages.","SBF noted that all of the measures \u201Cnever really averted\u201D economic impact from the pandemic, which is evident from soaring inflation, a slumping economy, and slumping markets \u2013 all of which \u201Ctrace back to COVID or our responses to it to try to mitigate the short-term economic impact.\u201D","\u201COne of the fortunate things is that this is bipartisan: No one wants pandemics,\u201D he added. \u201CThis isn\u2019t one party against another, in the way that some debates over some specific mitigation techniques ended up being.\u201D","Meanwhile, Abby Joseph Cohen, former Goldman Sachs strategist, argued that the biggest issue that could threaten the US in the coming years is a lack of labor force. Cohen said that the US has been very dependent on immigration. And as of now, there is a massive labor shortage at all ends.","\u201CI spent a lot of time looking at the other end,\u201D he said. \u201CDo we have enough new scientists? Do we have enough new engineers? Do we have enough new doctors? And the answer is: No, we don\u2019t.\u201D","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 FTX CEO: Some Smaller Exchanges Are \u2018Too Far Gone,\u2019 \u2018Insolvent,\u2019 and Unlikely to Be \u2018Saved\u2019\n\u2013 US Fed to Blame for Downturn, Large Crypto Players Have Responsibility Toward Ecosystem \u2013 FTX CEO\n\n\u2013 SEC\u2019s Peirce Says Crypto\u2019s Lack of \u2018Bailout Mechanism\u2019 Is a Strength; FTX CEO as a \u2018White Knight\u2019\n\u2013 Crypto Turmoil: 3AC Files for Bankruptcy, FTX and BlockFi Agree, Suspensions at Voyager\n\n\u2013 FTX\u2019s Bankman-Fried Hints at Bitcoin Lightning Network Integration After Community Backlash\n\u2013 Skeptical Twitter Users Say SBF\u2019s Proposed USD 1B Campaign Donation Is an \u2018Investment\u2019 Strategy\n__\n(Updated at 11:02 UTC to clarify that pandemics are considered to be the biggest threat.)"],"entity":[{"type":"19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Large Crypto Players Have Responsibility Toward Ecosystem \u2013 FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cohen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Lightning Network Integration After Community Backlash\n\u2013 Skeptical Twitter Users","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Abby Joseph Cohen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Peirce Says Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Coronavirus","Economics","Forecast","FTX","Inflation","Politics","Sam Bankman-Fried"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
