Additionally, much of the trading in ETH and other altcoins happens on offshore exchanges that are not regulated in the US.","In the past, Rostin Behnam, chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has said that bitcoin (BTC) is the only cryptocurrency that can be considered a commodity for regulatory purposes.","Similarly, Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has in the past called Bitcoin a commodity without saying anything about how he sees other cryptocurrencies.","In the statement on the action taken against KuCoin, Attorney General James also said that the action is part of a larger effort to \u201Crein in shadowy cryptocurrency companies and bring order to the industry.\u201D","\u201COne by one my office is taking action against cryptocurrency companies that are brazenly disregarding our laws and putting investors at risk,\u201D she said while adding:","\u201CAll New Yorkers and all companies operating in New York have to follow our state\u2019s laws and regulations. KuCoin operated in New York without registration and that is why we are taking strong action to hold them accountable and protect investors.\u201D","The Attorney General is now seeking a court order that would stop KuCoin from calling itself an \u201Cexchange,\u201D and that prevents the company from operating in New York via geo-blocking based on the \u201CIP addresses and GPS location\u201D of users."],"entity":[{"type":"KuCoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Letitia James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rostin Behnam","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York State","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"GPS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["ETH","Ethereum","KuCoin","Regulation"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
