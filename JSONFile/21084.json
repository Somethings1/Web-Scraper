The defense team argued that Kwon may not be in the United States until February or March at the earliest, prompting the request for a trial delay.","","In the event the court denies the postponement, Kwon\u2019s counsel has proposed that the jury be instructed to consider his absence and inability to testify as \u201Cnot unduly prejudicial to him.\u201D","The trial is currently scheduled to commence at the end of January. Kwon\u2019s extradition process faced delays as his legal team successfully appealed a decision by the Montenegro high court to extradite him to either the U.S. or South Korea. The Appeals Court ordered a retrial due to procedural issues.","In the U.S., both Do Kwon and the SEC have filed for summary judgment in their legal dispute. Each party is urging a federal judge to decide in their favor without proceeding to trial, arguing that the opposing side has not sufficiently substantiated their case.","The US SEC recently cited Terraform ruling in Binance and Coinbase lawsuits to make its case stronger."],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Appeals Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Terra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Do Kwon","Terra","US SEC"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
