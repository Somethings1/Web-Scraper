By the same logic, the definition would fail to capture that of crypto wallets where users maintain control of their private keys.","\u201CSubjecting developers of non-custodial crypto asset software to potential criminal liability\u2026 will only serve to stifle innovation and shake confidence in the DOJ\u2019s respect for the rule of law,\u201D the letter concluded.","By contrast, the DOJ\u2019s interpretation of the money-transmitting business statute posits that a money transmitter need not have actual control of the funds that it transfers. It likens money transmission to a USB cable transferring data between devices or a frying pan transmitting heat from a stove to the pan\u2019s contents.","Custodial vs self-custodial doesn't matter, legally","The DOJ also makes it crystal clear that a service does not have to be custodial in any way to be considered a money transmitter, and thus required to implement KYC\/AML, register with FinCEN, etc.","If this definition of a money\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/A9D5xukhM4","\u2014 Seth For Privacy | #FreeSamourai (@sethforprivacy) April 27, 2024","","The DOJ has since issued a warning to crypto users that they could lose funds in wallets provided by non-regulated entities, which could face future prosecution by the department."],"entity":[{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BSA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FinCEN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Samourai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Treasury Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Justice Department (DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MSB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 27, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cynthia Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ron Wyden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Privacy","US Senators"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
