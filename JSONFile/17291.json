The creator\u2019s non-profit, the Layer 1 Foundation (L1F), will now oversee the protocol\u2019s token management.","Domo announced that L1F will collaborate with UniSat and Best in Slot, key Bitcoin infrastructure providers, to serve as BRC-20\u2019s lead maintainers.","Overheard@isabelfoxenduke :","\u201CLayer 1 foundation will explore decentralized governance structure for BRC 20 tokens\u201D","\u2014 ðŸ§©Cosmos JoeðŸ§© (@CosmosDefi) March 11, 2024","","BRC-20 operates on the Bitcoin network\u2019s Ordinals Protocol, enabling the movement of non-BTC digital assets. The technology utilizes \u201Cinscriptions\u201D on satoshis, which are small units of BTC, to track, store data, and facilitate asset transfers on the Bitcoin Network.","","Governance for both the protocol and within the broader Bitcoin network has historically been a complex issue.","This was evident earlier in the year with a disagreement between Domo and UniSat, an Ordinals Protocol marketplace. UniSat supported a protocol upgrade for Ordinals known as \u201CJubilee\u201D which Domo opposed, stating it had the potential to divide the growing environment.","Despite this past conflict, Domo recognized UniSat\u2019s crucial early role in decentralizing the BRC-20 ecosystem.","","UniSat was the first marketplace to list BRC-20 tokens and collaboration between UniSat and Best in Slot resulted in the creation of a decentralized indexing product for BRC-20.","\u201CThe goal is to support the growth of Bitcoin metaprotocols on Ordinals and beyond,\u201D Domo stated. \u201CBRC-20 was an early experiment\u2014but we\u2019re seeing a wave of standards that need tools, infrastructure, and support to thrive.\u201D","To support the BRC-20 standard\u2019s governance framework, Domo created an oversight committee, which includes the Bitcoin Ordinals wallet, Oyl (which recently completed a pre-seed funding round with Domo\u2019s investment), and UXTO Management, part of Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s parent company, BTC Inc."],"entity":[{"type":"Cosmos Joe","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC Inc","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BRC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 11, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Domo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UXTO Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Asset","BRC-20","Ordinal Technology"],"authors":["Jimmy Aki"]}
