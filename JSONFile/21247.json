And most importantly, perhaps, was the point about how bitcoin\u2019s volatility should be embraced, and not feared.","Commenting on bitcoin\u2019s past volatility, Bhatia said that the volatility is indeed down, statistically speaking. However, he added that it \u201Cappears the opposite\u201D to the eyes of holders of the cryptocurrency, given the \u201Cmagnificent size\u201D of bitcoin price movements. ","Bitcoin price and volatility:","And while there will be questions about how something that claims to be a currency can be this volatile, Bhatia said that bitcoin adoption will still continue, as it has always done in the past. \u201CStay the course throughout this volatility, and you\u2019ll be rewarded over the long term,\u201D the popular author wrote.","Further in the newsletter, Bhatia noted that he sees no chance of any altcoin, stablecoin, or central bank digital currency (CBDC) posing a threat to bitcoin\u2019s adoption.","\u201CThese new digital instruments and securities orbit bitcoin but in no way threaten it,\u201D Bhatia wrote, explaining that both CBDCs and stablecoins are liabilities on the balance sheet of either a central bank or a private issuer, and therefore come with certain risks.","\u201CNeither of these two instruments offer buyers an asset without counterparty risk, and neither will work in an open way,\u201D Bhatia said, noting that the real innovation is the \u201Crise of a currency for everybody, controlled by nobody.\u201D ","He added: ","\u201CThe adoption cycle is still early. Based on past technology adoption cycles, bitcoin will attract a billion new users over the next few years. Eyes on the prize. Or have fun at the slot machines.\u201D","Lastly, Bhatia also said that although bitcoin holders are likely correct in their long-term view that the number one cryptocurrency may eventually become a contender for world reserve currency status, they need to be patient. ","\u201CThe dollar will be the world\u2019s reserve currency until bitcoin replaces it, sometime over the next few decades,\u201D Bhatia wrote, adding that part of his conviction about bitcoin is that its rise will take decades, not years or months.","At 13:38 UTC, BTC trades at USD 58,986 and is down by almost 6% in a day and 9% in a week, trimming its monthly gains to 36%.","\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 \u2018Extreme Volatility\u2019 Expected as Bitcoin Investors Learn to Value It\n\u2013 How Traditional Finance World Could Cause Traditional Global Financial Crisis\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Enters Price Discovery Mode, Lures Gold Investors\n\u2013 Volatility Is Crypto\u2019s Best Friend"],"entity":[{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nik Bhatia","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"36%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"How Traditional Finance World Could Cause Traditional Global Financial Crisis\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Enters Price Discovery Mode","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"University of Southern California","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bhatia","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","CBDC","Forecast","Stablecoin","Volatility"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
