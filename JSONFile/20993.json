Total payments jumped 410%.","Lightning Payments Except for Deposits\/Withdrawals to trading services:"," ","Meanwhile, Arcane\u2019s researchers also found that of the total payment volume in the first two months of 2022, about half of the value transacted came from transactions directly between individuals.","The next most popular way to use Lightning was exchange deposits and withdrawals, which came in with 32% of transactions. Lastly, 20% of payments were made up of purchases of goods and services, handled either through payment processors or by buying gift cards.","Distribution of Lightning Payments Volume in 2022:","When looking at usage in terms of the number of transactions, the report said so-called micro rewards dominate the picture.","These are transactions that are typically sent to a user for using a service, for example through a gaming service that rewards its players with satoshis (1\/100 million BTC) for playing a game \u2013 a concept known as play-to-earn (P2E).","\u201CAccording to our estimates, individuals sent each other more than 300,000 payments, made more than 200,000 payments for goods and services, and over 100,000 deposits or withdrawals to or from trading services in the first two months of 2022,\u201D the report said.","In terms of the future of Lightning \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s most popular Layer-2 network \u2013 Arcane said that although the network\u2019s usage is still far behind legacy payment networks like Visa, the potential for \u201Cexplosive growth\u201D exists. This potential comes from both users using bitcoin over the Lightning Network directly, and for the network to be used as a payment rail for fiat currencies, the report said.","Also, according to them, with the Lightning Network, usage can continue to grow even as we \u201Cwait for hyperbitcoinization to explode\u201D through the use of the network simply as a payment rail for traditional currencies."," ","____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Play-to-Earn Bitcoin Games: How Lightning Network Enables Gamers to Earn Sats\n\u2013 Taproot Adoption Remains Low, But Devs Say It Isn\u2019t a Problem for Bitcoin\n\n\u2013 New Bitcoin\u2019s Chance to \u2018Bitcoinize the Dollar\u2019\n\u2013 7 Popular Bitcoin Lightning Network Wallets for 2022\n\u2013 Bitcoin Lightning Network Is Growing Faster Than You Think\n\n\u2013 A Non-Custodial Bitcoin Interest Rate Account?
