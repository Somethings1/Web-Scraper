Well done to the ONBTC and @BFXSecurities on this historic milestone! https:\/\/t.co\/6SCPvjiunx","\u2014 Liquid Network ðŸŒŠ (@Liquid_BTC) May 15, 2024","","Liquid is a Bitcoin sidechain managed by Blockstream and a federation of 65 Bitcoin-centric companies globally. Utilizing BTC as its native asset, the blockchain facilitates faster, cheaper, and more private transactions than the main Bitcoin blockchain.","Beyond BTC, Liquid allows for the issuance of tokens representing diverse assets, including stablecoins like Tether (USDT), meme coins, and real-world assets and securities.","One of El Salvador\u2019s token offerings involves investing in constructing the first hotel at El Salvador International Airport. The investment would yield 10% annually over a five-year term, requiring a minimum investment of $1000.","\u201CThe infrastructure will include 80 rooms, five commercial spaces each measuring 99 square meters, a swimming pool, and various amenities such as restaurants, a gym, gardens, multipurpose rooms, among others,\u201D the offering states on the Inverlag Hotels website.","Investors would also secure free nights at the hotel they are helping build. Anyone who invests $1 million gets an all-year-round free stay throughout the bond\u2019s five-year lifespan.","\u201CThese opportunities are typically unavailable to the general public,\u201D explained Roberto Laguardia, CEO of Inverlag, in an interview. \u201CThey are usually reserved for large-scale or institutional investors and private equity firms\u2026 However, with a minimum investment of $1000, individuals can access a 10% interest rate, paid bi-annually, over a five-year period.\u201D","The tokenized issuance was conducted by El Salvador Bitcoin startup DitoBanx, while the exchange platform used to issue the tokens is Bitfinex. Due to regulations, the investment is not available to U.S. investors.","El Salvador is the first and only country in the world to treat El Salvador Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The state regularly invests in BTC and runs a Bitcoin mining operation powered by geothermal energy from the region\u2019s local volcanoes.","El Salvador\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin extends beyond its legal tender status, as these new tokenized investment offerings demonstrate. The Bitcoin Office said this week that the nation has mined 474 BTC since 2021 and now holds 5,750 BTC ($378 million) in total."],"entity":[{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Blockstream","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"El Salvador Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"\u2019s National Bitcoin Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Roberto Laguardia","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"El Salvador International Airport","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$378 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"El Salvador\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Asset tokenization","Bitcoin Blockchain","El Salvador"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
