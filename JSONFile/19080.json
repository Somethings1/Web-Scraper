It is relying on the Catena Blockchain Suite built by Bitaccess to securely store up-to-date information on government grants.","Each time a grant is awarded, Bitaccess creates a permanent record of the data on the blockchain and the NRC IRAP posts the information online. Canadians can search for funding opportunities by date, recipient, amount and geographic area. Each grant also has a unique transaction ID on the Ethereum transaction explorer.","The project is now live, and it currently shows a top grant of USD 11.8 million was given to Ryerson University in late 2016. The most recent award released was to Chinova Bioworks for USD 19,997 in late 2017.","NRC IRAP first revealed plans for this initiative in June 2017 at a blockchain \u201Ckickoff session\u201D at the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) Service Lab. Funding for the blockchain project also comes from Public Services and Procurement Canada\u2019s Build in Canada Innovation Program (BCIP)."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitaccess","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ryerson University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chinova Bioworks for USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NRC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Public Services and Procurement Canada\u2019s Build","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Catena Blockchain Suite","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Canada\u2019s National Research Council Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD 11.8 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Blockchain","Canada","Ethereum","Transparency"],"authors":["Julia Travers"]}
