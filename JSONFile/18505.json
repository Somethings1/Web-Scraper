Singaporean law stipulates that the foreign owners of certain firms can apply for citizenship if they meet a number of criteria. These include living in Singapore for a period of two or more years \u2013 a criterion Kwon has seemingly already fulfilled.","Applicants must also contribute a certain amount of money to Singaporean national funds.","The same report quoted an unnamed \u201Cformer Terra network developer\u201D as claiming that Kwon was indeed currently \u201Ctrying to acquire Singaporean citizenship.\u201D The same developer claimed that they were one of those who had been told to remain in South Korea until the investigation had been completed.","The report stated that the ban does not apply to Kwon. South Korean officials claim Kwon is currently residing in Singapore.","But more travel bans could be in the pipelines \u2013 the unnamed developer reportedly stated that \u201Csince several developers worked together\u201D on the Terra network, \u201Cmore employees\u201D will likely be \u201Cbanned from leaving the country\u201D in the coming days.","The same developer, KBS reported, was \u201Cin charge of designing and developing core projects\u201D such as the Anchor lending and borrowing protocol.","The Anchor lending protocol housed the majority of UST\u2019s circulating supply, and it was used as a key incentive mechanism for users to hold the UST stablecoin with its high yields of 20%.","However, the report noted that prosecutors have thus far made \u201Cno significant progress\u201D in their investigation of Kwon.","MBC, another national broadcaster, reported that the United States regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) interviewed Kwon for four and a half hours as part of its investigation into the Terra network\u2019s Mirror Protocol in July last year. The SEC followed up by serving Kwon with a subpoena in September 2021.","The same report added that the SEC had asked Kwon to provide answers on 27 points, and conducted its interview via video link.\n____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 How Tokenomics Might Change in the Wake of the Terra Collapse\n\u2013 New Luna Token Down Almost 90% From Its All-Time High and Keeps Trending Lower","\u2013 Big Wallets Exited Anchor\/UST While Smaller Fish Continued to Invest \u2013 Jump Crypto\n\u2013 \u2018Speculative\u2019 Luna Classic Best Seen as a Meme Coin","\u2013 After Terra\u2019s Collapse, Cryptoverse Reflects on \u2018Ponzi-like Assets\u2019, Role of VCs, and \u2018Ignorant\u2019 Crypto People\n\u2013 A Curious Coincidence \u2013 Major Terra Backers Break Silence on Same Day"],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Terra\u2019s Collapse","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Big Wallets Exited Anchor","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Time High","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"\u2018Ignorant\u2019 Crypto People\n\u2013 A Curious Coincidence \u2013 Major Terra Backers Break Silence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"KBS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"How Tokenomics Might Change","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Do Kwon","Legal","Singapore","South Korea","Terra"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
