Meanwhile, 50% of SHIB\u2019s total supply is deposited to the wallet of Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin, while the Ethereum fees skyrocket yet again and DOGE received another boost from Elon Musk.","DOGE has become such a widespread phenomenon both within the Cryptoverse and outside of it, that it\u2019s little surprise we\u2019re seeing projects trying to capitalize on its image\/likeness.","And today, Elon Musk took to Twitter yet again to fuel the flames, asking if Tesla should accept the coin \u2013 with 77% of nearly 1.24m votes saying \u2018yes\u2019 and 22 hours to go.","DOGE jumped by around 14% in half an hour and is now (10:10 UTC) trading at USD 0.519. The price is unchanged in a day and is up by 19% in a week.","However, a digital \u2018dog\u2019 coin, launched in August 2020, is the talk of the town today. Called SHIB, it\u2019s referencing the Shiba Inu dog breed, which has been so firmly connected to DOGE that it\u2019s its first association.","Perhaps there\u2019d be nothing much to talk about SHIB has its price not jumped in the past month, the speculations being that it caught the eye of Chinese investors, in addition to being listed on major exchanges Binance, OKEx, and Huobi \u2013 all popular with Chinese traders.","Binance\u2019s May 10 announcement describes it as \u201Can experiment in decentralized community building and another meme coin similar to Dogecoin [and] the first token to be listed and used as an incentive for using ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange.\u201D It also adds that three wallets hold 60.5% of the coin\u2019s total supply.","Binance shortly suspended all withdrawals on the same day, with some suggesting it was due to the SHIB trading traffic.","CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also said that \u201Ca large number of users\u201D were demanding SHIB.","\u201CSHIB token allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them,\u201D stated OKEx\u2019s announcement.","The Shiba Token website adds to all this that SHIB is nicknamed \u2018the DOGECOIN KILLER\u2019, and that it\u2019s an ERC-20 only token which \u201Ccan remain well under a penny and still outpace Dogecoin in a small amount of time.\u201D","50% of the total supply is locked in Uniswap and the keys were thrown away, they said, while \u201Cthe remaining 50% was burned to Vitalik Buterin and we were the first project following this path, so everyone has to buy on the open market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where devs don\u2019t own team tokens they can dump on the community.\u201D","The \u201Cwoofpaper\u201D explains further that the founder, called Ryoshi \u2013 who claimed to dislike centralized exchanges \u2013 chose Ethereum as a \u201Csecure and well-established\u201D network that allows decentralization and growth, while half of the total supply is sent to Ethereum co-founder\u2019s wallet because \u201Cthere is no greatness without a vulnerable point and as long as VB doesn\u2019t rug us, then SHIBA will grow and survive.\u201D","So the team gave Buterin the coins he didn\u2019t ask for to do as he pleases, but his move could potentially bring the price down should he ever decide to sell them.","Per CoinGecko, at 7:43 UTC, the coin\u2019s price is up 120% in a day, 1,944% in a week, and 39,205% in a month, now trading at USD 0.00003249. The maximum token supply is 1 quadrillion, while the circulation supply and the market capitalization remain under a question mark. According to CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization is USD 11.95bn, and ranks 18th by this metric.","SHIB price chart:","Those behind SHIB also launched LEASH, the purpose of which was \u201Cto tame DOGE [in a way that, every day] the price of LEASH will rebase to 1000\/1 the price of DOGE.\u201D Now, it has been unleashed and will not rebase, the website added, announcing the next token called BONE Dogecoin Killer, with the details to be revealed along with ShibaSwap.","They also claim that a percentage of purchases using Amazon Smile goes to a non-profit Shiba Inu Rescue Association.","Speaking of the Ethereum network \u2013 while dropping somewhat by the beginning of the month, Ethereum median transaction fee started rising on May 2 and then jumped on May 7, altogether seeing a 684% increase in a matter of eight days. On May 10, the number stood at USD 31.","This is in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC)\u2018s median fee of USD 8.25 on the same day, while its highest in the past month was USD 28 \u2013 still lower than Ethereum\u2019s latest jump.","This, some find, could be SHIB\u2019s work as well.","And while some claim that a lot of money can be made with a portfolio comprised entirely of dog-themed coins, with the sudden rise in SHIB, much like what happened with SafeMoon in late April, came many warnings against purchasing the coin.","Many are also calling it a scam, likening it to the famous Bitconnect scam.","To others, there\u2019s no difference between the \u2018dog\u2019 coins, or others described as scams. While everybody are free to do what they want, \u201Cthings like DOGE, SHIB, SafeMoon take away the spotlight from the decentralized future we\u2019re trying to build,\u201D argued analyst Michaël van de Poppe, adding that \u201C90% of the people will lose money on it.\u201D","\u201CYou can make a lot of money short term on memecoins, but the stink stays on you for a while if you are looking to stick around and build,\u201D tweeted Messari CEO Ryan Selkis.","Per CZ, \u201Cit seems people don\u2019t care about use cases anymore. We are probably in a bull market.\u201D","Pierre Rochard, a Bitcoin strategist at the Kraken exchange, called the entire situation absurd:","_____","__","__","__","__","__","____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Traders Rotate From Bitcoin To Alts, While JPMorgan Sees Ether As Overvalued\n\u2013 Dogecoin Needs 3 Conditions Fulfilled to Move Beyond USD 1","\u2013 New Generation of \u2018Bitconnectors\u2019 Flock into SafeMoon Despite Warnings\n\u2013 Are GameStop-Style Surges In Crypto Any Different From Old Pumps & Dumps?\n{no_ads}"],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"SafeMoon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pierre Rochard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dogecoin Needs 3 Conditions Fulfilled to Move Beyond USD 1","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michaël van de Poppe","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shiba Token","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"120%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ShibaSwap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ryan Selkis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"39,205%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD 0.00003249","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Any Different From Old Pumps & Dumps","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Amazon Smile","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"77%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"684%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1,944%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Uniswap","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cryptoverse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cryptoverse","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"14%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shiba Inu Rescue Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"late April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"60.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shiba Inu (SHIB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinMarketCap","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Binance","Bitcoin","Dogecoin","Elon Musk","Ethereum","Fees","OKEx","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
