On November 9, the average transaction network fee reached USD 62 per transaction. As of now, Ethereum transactions cost around USD 44, according to BitInfoCharts.","After highlighting concerns regarding the transaction fees on the Ethereum network, Buterin suggested the new EIP-4488, saying that it would \u201Cdecrease transaction calldata gas cost, and add a limit of how much total transaction calldata can be in a block.\u201D","In other words, EIP-4488 would limit the total transaction calldata, where data from external calls to functions are stored, before reducing the calldata gas cost to remove the possibility of breaking the network.","\u201CSimply decreasing the calldata gas cost from 16 to 3 would increase the maximum block size to 10M bytes. This would push the Ethereum p2p [peer-to-peer] networking layer to unprecedented levels of strain and risk breaking the network; some previous live tests of ~500 kB blocks a few years ago had already taken down a few bootstrap nodes,\u201D Buterin said.","He added that the \u201Cdecrease-cost-and-cap proposal\u201D would increase the maximum block size to 1.5 MB, which \u201Cwill be sufficient while preventing most of the security risk.\u201D","The new solution is anticipated to reduce data transaction costs. As per BitMEX Research, an industry analysis firm, the update could reduce gas fees by five times.","Looks like Ethereum may soon effectively have a 1MB blocksize limit!\n\nThis is part of the process to lower the gas cost of data by around 5 times, to make rollups cheaperhttps:\/\/t.co\/W98cePpnKP","If the proposal is approved, the implementation would require a scheduled network upgrade. ","Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the implications of the update. For one, Alex Krusz, an Ethereum developer, said that there could be several far-reaching consequences as a result of the update.","\u201CWhile ostensibly simple, it could be argued that the calldata limit is an architectural decision with greater implications than just modifying a gas constant,\u201D Krusz said. \u201CIf there is an arbitrary limit imposed, why not make it a soft limit, or impose it on the entire block size rather than on calldata specifically?\u201D","Tim Beiko, an Ethereum Core developer, said that one of the challenges to the calldata solution is that it \u201Cinfluences the block sizes on Ethereum.\u201D","\u201CIt\u2019s literally data we add to each transaction. If we lower the gas cost, and keep the same gas limit, we then have bigger blocks, which can be problematic in the short and long term,\u201D Beiko said.","Long term, it increases the size of the Ethereum blockchain. If we go from adding 0.1MB of chaindata per block to even 0.5MB, that's a 5x increase in the rate of chain growth.","Notably, EIP-4488 is a \u201Cshort-term\u201D remedy for Ethereum\u2019s sky-high gas fees. Arguably, the main update that is expected to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability issue is the shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.","At 10:12 UTC on Monday morning, ETH was trading at USD 4,298. It\u2019s up almost 6%, erasing almost all its losses in the past week. ","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Ethereum Gas Fees Highest During US Business Hours, Coin Metrics Finds\n\u2013 Ethereum Fee Debate Heats Up as Avalanche Enters and Exits Top 10\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Fees Pushed Higher by DEX Trading as Optimism\u2019s Upgrade Nears\n\u2013 Ethereum Tests All-Time High as On-Chain Activity Grows, SHIB Burns ETH\n\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 Helped Coinbase Save ETH 27 on Daily Fees\n\u2013 Ethereum Users Flock To Arbitrum In Search of Scalability"],"entity":[{"type":"November 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Burns","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"4488","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex Krusz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1559","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Krusz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tim Beiko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"BitMEX Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Beiko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum Gas Fees Highest During US Business Hours","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Users Flock To Arbitrum In Search of Scalability","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Fees"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
