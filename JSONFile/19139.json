The bank is now refocusing on its core clientele.","The relationship between Goldman Sachs and Apple faced challenges from the beginning. ","Apple\u2019s advertisements stating that the card was not from a bank reportedly irritated certain Goldman executives. ","Moreover, Apple insisted on approving nearly all applicants, leading to increased loan losses for Goldman. ","Apple\u2019s requirement to send cardholders\u2019 bills at the beginning of the month also caused significant customer service challenges for Goldman, as most card programs stagger bill distribution to avoid overwhelming call volumes.","Some Goldman executives privately attribute regulatory scrutiny faced by the bank to its association with Apple. ","Last year, Goldman disclosed that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was investigating its credit card account management practices, including billing error resolutions and cardholder refunds. ","The Federal Reserve has also been examining Goldman\u2019s broader consumer-lending business."," In response, Goldman has initiated Project Blue, an internal effort focused on addressing regulatory issues, and has been reassigning employees from consumer lending to support this endeavor."," "],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Amazon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2029","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Synchrony Financial","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goldman","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"next 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"American Express","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs\u2019","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Apple","Goldman Sachs"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
