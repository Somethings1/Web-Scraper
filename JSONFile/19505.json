At 09:13 UTC, it trades at USD 0.0000166 and is up by 4% in a day, having dropped by 56% from its all-time high of USD 0.00003791 (per Coingecko), reached on May 10. However, the price is still up by 2,341% in a month.","Last week, Buterin made a series of donations to charitable organizations, totaling some USD 1.2bn, and which included 50trn SHIB tokens donated to India\u2019s Crypto COVID Relief Fund.","Now, according to Etherscan, Buterin burned (destroyed) 90% of his remaining SHIB, worth billions worth of dollars, including with the transaction an explanation.","\u201CSimply holding the remaining coins in the 0xab58 wallet forever was never an option; for security reasons alone they would have to be moved to a better wallet eventually, and any transaction I make would get interpreted as an action,\u201D he said, adding that it was better to do something useful with it right away.","Therefore, SHIB 410.24trn SHIB tokens, worth USD 6.58bn at the time of the transaction, was burned.","The remaining 10% will be sent to a charity \u201Cwith similar values to cryptorelief (preventing large-scale loss of life) but with a more long-term orientation,\u201D Buterin said.","As a reminder, 50% of SHIB\u2019s total supply was deposited to the wallet of the Ethereum co-founder.","However, he emphasized that he does not want any coins or power in a project to be given to him without his consent. \u201CI don\u2019t *want* to be a locus of power of that kind. Better to just print the coins into the hands of a worthy charity directly (though do talk to them first),\u201D he noted.","Nonetheless, the new billionaire said that he\u2019s been \u201Cimpressed by how the dog token communities have treated the recent donations,\u201D with \u201Cplenty of dog people\u201D focusing not only on their own profits but also being interested in improving the world.","But despite this burn, with the positive sentiment among commenters apparently increasing in relations to Buterin\u2019s move \u2013 donating some, while burning the most, presumably to prevent the price from plunging \u2013 some commented that there is \u201Cstill a bajillion coins\u201D out there. Its circulating supply, per CoinGecko, is SHIB 497.72trn.","That said, not all were happy with Buterin the Shiba Burner. The Telegram group War on Rugs created the rug ethereum (RETH) token following Buterin\u2019s donation, claiming the move had crashed the market and hurt the investors. A 4% tax is applied on all transactions, said the retaliation coin creators, with 2% going to holders, and 2% towards borrowing ETH to be dumped on decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Venus Protocol, built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), in favor of binance coin (BNB).\n____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Buterin Paid USD 800+ In Fees For 9 Major Transactions on Ethereum\n\u2013 \u2018DOGE Killer\u2019 Shiba Inu Clogs Ethereum While Musk Lifts Dogecoin Again","\u2013 Dogecoin Needs 3 Conditions Fulfilled to Move Beyond USD 1\n\u2013 Who Let the DOGE Clones out?
