B made their money by \u201Cmanaging\u201D crypto investments and wallets for customers, and the duo had begun a \u201Cromantic relationship.\u201D","A introduced B to C, telling the latter that B was an exceptional crypto broker who could help safeguard C\u2019s funds. Eventually, C decided to place their trust in B. And in October 2017, C finally handed over the funds or the private keys to their wallet to B in a coffee shop in Gangnam, Seoul, paying a commission fee in the process.","However, the couple then almost immediately proceeded to convert almost USD 1m worth of the tokens to cash, which they subsequently spent on expensive cars and \u201Cprecious metals,\u201D and failed to return the rest of the funds.","C eventually discovered what had happened and alerted the police, who eventually arrested A and B. The duo was tried in August last year under the terms of the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes (fraud) Act, with the presiding judge handing them both identical seven-year sentences.","The couple had hoped to reduce their sentences or overturn the verdict, but the Suwon High Court justice upheld both, stating:","\u201CThe defendants inflicted damages worth [around USD 3.76m] on the victim: The size of the fraud was large; the damages were not repaired, the defendants bought expensive precious metals and automobiles after commiting the crime; and the victim wanted them to be punished for what they had done.\u201D","_____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Illicit Activity\u2019s Share in Crypto Shrinks, \u2018Significant Problem\u2019 Remains\n\u2013 Metaverse Offers Future Full of Potential \u2013 for Terrorists and Extremists, too\n\n\u2013 Tether Freezes USD 160M-Heavy Addresses on Law Enforcement Request\n\u2013 Prosecutors Want to Put \u2018Bogus\u2019 Crypto Exchange Chiefs Behind Bars for Life in Legal First"],"entity":[{"type":"Suwon High Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Shrinks","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gangnam","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Metaverse Offers Future Full of Potential","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Exchange Chiefs Behind Bars","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Seoul","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"August last year","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Crime","Fraud","South Korea","XRP"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
