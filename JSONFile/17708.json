With AI, however, there\u2019s no telling whether it will strengthen smart contacts or their attackers the most, and the balance of its benefits may oscillate over time.","The absolute volume of stolen DeFi funds dropped from $3.1 billion in 2022 to $1.1 billion in 2023, with the number of incidents also falling from 273 to 172.","Beyond its impact on DeFi, artificial intelligence could have worrying implications for romance scams, also known as \u201Cpig butchering\u201D scams. These scams begin with seemingly innocent contact, evolving into a fabricated relationship that the scammer then exploits for financial gain.","\u201CThat is an area where a large language model that has infinite patience and is quite creative could be used to devastating effect by illicit actors,\u201D Jardine noted.","Romance scammers in crypto nearly doubled their revenue last year compared to 2022, despite a decline in total scam volume from $6.5 billion to $4.6 billion. The average size of a romance payment is $4,593, though the average victim likely paid far more since such scams often involve multiple payments.","As a share of all crypto transactions, illicit activity fell to just 0.34% of blockchain activity in 2023."],"entity":[{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.34%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jardine","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$6.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Chainalysis Cybercrimes Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eric Jardine","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 29, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4,593","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4.6 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.1 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["AI","Artificial Intelligence","crypto scams"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
