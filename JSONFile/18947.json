Rather, attackers are highly adaptable.","\u201CThe relationship between security measures and cyber threats is more akin to a continuous cat-and-mouse game, particularly in our rapidly evolving industry,\u201D he said. ","\u201CAttackers possess the ability to identify vulnerabilities in current infrastructure and exploit them for their benefit.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"mid-December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kate Kurbanova","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lazarus Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mixin Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$114 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$600 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Chainalysis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$126 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Raz Niv","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$120 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Euler Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$200 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CTO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Crypto hack"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
