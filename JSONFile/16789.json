But crypto is such a striking example of old world meeting new that it offers firms a rare opportunity to break into a market that would simply be impossible under normal circumstances.","","","\u201CIn the traditional world you can\u2019t really build a custodian, it\u2019s not something you can just break into,\u201D said Diogo Monica, co-founder of Anchorage, a Silicon Valley-based custody platform specializing in crypto. \u201CBNY Mellon has been around for 300 years and now, in crypto, we have a chance to actually build a foundational company that is potentially going to last for that long,\u201D added Monica.","","","It\u2019s an inspirational long view for sure, but how will things evolve over the short term?","","","Recent acquisitions in the crypto space have seen a bundling together of services such as custody, settlement, lending and trade execution. The latest push along the prime broker route came Wednesday with bitcoin futures platform Bakkt teaming up with Galaxy Digital to combine custodial and trading capabilities.","","","Read more: Behind \u2018Prime Broker\u2019 Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms","","","If crypto is entering a period of accelerated consolidation and following similar lines to the traditional world, firms specializing in standalone custody or trade execution may need to pivot to offer additional services or risk being swallowed up.","","","An evolution towards something like traditional finance is definitely how regulated crypto custodian BitGo sees it playing out. ","","","\u201CThis space is going to consolidate very quickly around big strong reputable brands, much like what happened with State Street, JPMorgan, BNY Mellon,\u201D said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe.","","","The recent unveiling of BitGo Prime allows the platform\u2019s customers to trade directly from cold storage (where cryptographic keys are held deep inside BitGo\u2019s offline, insured vaults) across a choice of two exchanges and two large over-the-counter (OTC) desks. ","","","This saves firms the rigmarole of opening and funding accounts at various exchanges and moving assets around, said Belshe, declining to name the venues currently connected to BitGo\u2019s incipient trading offering.","","","\u201CAll four are tier-one, top-ranked, regulated businesses you\u2019d recognize. We will start naming them in due course. The plan is to grow that by the end of the year to more than a dozen,\u201D Belshe said.","","","Although a one-stop-shop prime broker platform seems to be what many crypto firms now aspire to, it could be about the buzzword rather than a full understanding of the services being provided.  ","","","Prime brokerage is more of a financial services function than a tech function, a fact that may be lost on the new breed of crypto pioneers, said Michael Moro, CEO, Genesis Trading, which recently acquired standalone custodian Vo1t. (Disclosure: Genesis is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.)","","","Read more: Genesis Trading Buys Crypto Custodian Vo1t in Bid to Become Prime Broker","","","\u201CAs well as having a large balance sheet, attention to client services is an essential aspect when it comes to choosing a prime broker platform,\u201D said Moro. \u201CI think everyone wants the white glove, high touch service, which is how prime brokerage works in traditional finance. But that\u2019s very different from a tech software model.\u201D","","","The latter approach is to try and scale the business through technology as much as possible, rather than hiring customer service representatives or business development staff, Moro said.  ","","","\u201CIn institutional finance, the ability to pick up the phone and speak to your coverage person is so important,\u201D he said. \u201CBeing able to speak to a human being, as opposed to clicking a few buttons on a platform, I think will be a differentiator among what prime broker platforms are around in a year or two.\u201D","","","It\u2019s tempting to write this off as an overly cautious crypto boomer approach, pandering to traditional legacy systems. But to do so could be a strategic error.","","","A focus on gently transitioning traditional capital markets over to crypto is gaining traction for London-based Koine, which is offering a post-trade solution for digital assets combining custody, settlement and cash management. Koine\u2019s solution has so far been rubber-stamped by regulators in the U.K. and the United Arab Emirates. ","","","\u201CThe path we envisage involves the ability to transition from existing infrastructure, rather than a new model everyone must switch to,\u201D said Phil Mochan, Koine\u2019s co-founder and head of strategy.","","","Read more: Coinbase Buys Tagomi as \u2018Foundation\u2019 of Institutional Trading Arm","","","Building bridges between existing market infrastructure and crypto native exchanges is something Koine is tackling in stages, said Mochan. Bitfinex was the first exchange to publicly announce an integration with Koine, and there are currently 12 other workflow models at different stages depending on the trading venue or OTC desk, he said. ","","","\u201CIt\u2019s not going to happen overnight,\u201D said Mochan, framing the technological challenge specifically in terms of old-meets-new. \u201CWe find there are operational issues around API work almost everywhere, and that\u2019s because 21-year-olds have built these platforms.\u201D","","","Over the past couple of years, custody platforms have sought to differentiate themselves by offering new and innovative services such as earning yields on proof-of-stake (PoS) tokens by verifying transactions on a network or participating in governance decisions.  ","","","However, Moro of Genesis said that while this might have looked like a product differentiator at one stage, it no longer really counts \u2013 since many custodians now offer staking and even exchanges such as Binance have gotten in on the act.  ","","","\u201CIf you\u2019ll pardon the pun, staking has become like table stakes for holding onto customers' funds,\u201D said Moro. \u201CI think it\u2019s really hard to differentiate yourself because the barrier to mimicking is not that high.\u201D","","","But not all staking services are the same, just as not all custody is the same, said Monica of Anchorage, which uses a complex blend of hardware security modules (HSMs), threshold signing and multiple signatures to lock down crypto assets. ","","","Read more: Beyond Storage: How Custody Is Evolving to Meet Institutional Needs","","","\u201CThe space is rife with people using manual operations from 10 years ago, where they have to actually go to a vault,\u201D Monica said, adding that cold storage solutions of this type became unworkable under COVID-19 lockdown and social distancing.","","","On the subject of providing staking services, Monica said: \u201CThis stuff is hard to build. It may be table stakes in the sense that nobody wants to store an asset with you unless you can generate yield for it. Nobody wants to drop dividends on the floor in the traditional market so why would that be different in crypto?\u201D","","","Anchorage\u2019s strategy from day one has been to build everything in-house, said Monica, pointing to the Frankenstein-like assemblage of crypto\u2019s recent crop of aspiring prime brokers. ","","","\u201CThis can\u2019t just be bolted on. Everything that touches a cryptographic private key is deserving of the ultimate security and attention,\u201D he said. \u201CThe path to prime [brokerage] is not by bolting on different solutions built by different individuals and companies with different backgrounds and philosophies.\u201D","","","An unavoidable consequence of crypto prime brokerage is further centralization in a sector built on the premise of decentralization. While the prime broker model may bring a concentration of risk plus added costs, asking traditional players to try out new variants like DeFi (decentralized finance) is a big ask.","","","Nevertheless, the fast-growing world of DeFi is attracting lots of attention since it eschews traditional finance rather than simply trying to replicate it. With that, comes alternative approaches to trading, settlement and also custody. ","","","Read more: Crypto Long & Short: The Emergence of Prime Brokers Adds Resilience but Also Risk","","","\u201CWe have exactly the same goals but we always try to be slightly less centralized, as much as we possibly can,\u201D said Alex Batlin, CEO of Trustology, a custody platform backed by ConsenSys and Two Sigma Ventures. ","","","\u201CThe question is,\u201D Batlin said, \u201Cdo you wrap it all up like in the old days into a single prime broker with all the risks associated with that, or do you try achieve the same goals but with the lower prices and lower risk associated with decentralization?\u201D","","","The DeFi custody hypothesis also does away with cold storage: Trustology uses HSMs for near real-time access to assets that cannot be commingled in omnibus accounts. ","","","While the DeFi space is definitely tech-first, Trustology recognizes self-custody without controls is not fit for business or institutional contexts.","","","\u201CThere\u2019s an emerging white space which we are trying to fill,\u201D said Batlin, \u201CWe can sign any ethereum transaction or any DeFi protocol fast and segregated, and apply controls.\u201D","","","Trustology sees decentralized clearing as a viable alternative option, with custodians acting as settlement agents, trying up with protocols like AirSwap. Brokers are also eyeing the billion or so dollars of liquidity locked up in DeFi, said Batlin.  ","","","\u201CBrokers are looking to access liquidity and margin on those protocols; asset managers are looking at it the same,\u201D he said. \u201CThere are possibly some really interesting plays around committing funds to staking, to collateralized lending, so you get the ability to do a long while being at yield that\u2019s relatively safe.\u201D","","","While Trustology is focused on Ethereum, Fidelity-backed KNØX is applying its energy towards Bitcoin. ","","","Read more: In Rare Deal, Crypto Custodian Wins Insurance on Full Value of Client Assets","","","The Canada-based custodian, which holds insurance from mega-broker Marsh, is \u201Cphilosophically aligned\u201D with Bitcoin and the technologies being built on top, according to KNØX co-founder and CEO Alex Daskalov.","","","\u201CWe have yet to see a custodian that has a tight integration with the Lightning Network, for example,\u201D Daskalov said, referring to the bitcoin scaling solution built for faster payments. \u201CWe would love to be there in lockstep with a lot of the tech riding on Bitcoin and layers above it such as Lightning and Liquid.\u201D","","","Growth in the traditional trading space is not all about competition, there\u2019s co-operation too, which benefits the whole market. There\u2019s also evidence of this among some crypto custodians and brokers ","","","For example, recently launched prime broker BeQuant, which has its own custody solution, says it is open to working with other custodians in the space, as clients want to spread risk just as they do in traditional finance.","","","\u201CI think you need those standalone guys,\u201D said Richard Shade, BeQuant\u2019s head of custody. \u201CWe are open to working and collaborating with a number of these guys and we are talking to all of them, because we realize our customers may already be using them.\u201D","","","Read more: Bequant Launches Crypto Prime Brokerage to Compete for Institutional Money","","","London-based custodian Copper, which raised an $8 million Series A in February, says it is also happy to collaborate, as well as compete.","","","\u201CWe are happy to work with people on financing and with people on clearing,\u201D said Copper founder and CEO Dmitry Tokarev, who added that the recent funding affords the firm a further 18 months of runway.","","","Copper\u2019s ClearLoop settlement solution differs from something like BitGo\u2019s, which is geared towards everyone having a BitGo account, Tokarev said. ","","","\u201CWe have already asked other custodians to join the network because that is the best solution for clients at the end of the day. The more exchanges and custodians that join the network, the more efficient (and secure) the entire trading ecosystem becomes. It\u2019s better for everyone, not just Copper,\u201D Tokarev said.","","","It\u2019s not all kumbaya around the crypto-custody campfire, however. When it comes to the crypto prime broker race, BitGo likes to take a jab at arch-rival Coinbase.","","","Last year, when Coinbase acquired the institutional business of crypto wallet and custody provider Xapo, that brought the San Francisco exchange\u2019s assets under custody to over $7 billion. At that time, BitGo publicly courted former Xapo clients, which were said to have expressed concern over the new arrangement.","","","Read more: Crypto Exchange Coinbase Acquires Xapo\u2019s Institutional Custody Business","","","Following this train of thought, BitGo\u2019s Belshe said the recent acquisition of Vo1t by Genesis was probably a strategy to take back custody of about $2.7 billion worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust assets and bring these under common ownership. (Like Genesis, Grayscale is also a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.)","","","\u201CGrayscale was with Xapo and was sold over to Coinbase, for a pretty high premium by the way,\u201D said Belshe. \u201CI\u2019m guessing that DCG, the Genesis team and the Grayscale team want to pull that custody back.\u201D","","","But Michael Moro of Genesis scotched Belshe\u2019s theory. ","","","\u201CAs I evaluated Vo1t, that was not a consideration at all,\u201D said Moro. \u201CI'm actually not even privy to the contract that Grayscale and Coinbase have so I don\u2019t know the terms or how long it lasts. My understanding is it\u2019s longer-term so that wouldn\u2019t be a near-term event, regardless.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"Batlin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anchorage","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Moro of Genesis","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Belshe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Phil Mochan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex Daskalov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Moro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Koine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Custodian Wins Insurance on Full Value of Client Assets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mike Belshe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Daskalov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Genesis Trading Buys Crypto Custodian Vo1t","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Frankenstein","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monica","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bequant Launches Crypto Prime Brokerage to Compete for Institutional Money","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monica","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Silicon Valley","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tokarev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Two Sigma Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"San Francisco","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Alex Batlin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Become Prime Broker","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United Arab Emirates","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Long & Short","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Xapo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Firms","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Koine","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Exchange Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marsh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"from 10 years ago","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dmitry Tokarev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"State Street","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Richard Shade","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Diogo Monica","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AirSwap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNY Mellon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Genesis Trading","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["BitGo","Xapo","Institutional Investment","Institutional Investors","Custody","Genesis Trading","Anchorage","Knox Wallet","Trustology","Copper","Koine","Prime Brokerage"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
