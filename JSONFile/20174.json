The latter is an agency that answers to the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the top financial regulator.","Per Money Today and GetNews, the FSC and FIU are keen to discover if the trading platforms have successfully integrated AML solutions that allow them to communicate data to one another, as well as the regulators, and effectively flag suspicious-looking transactions.","AML protocols are a new development for most exchanges, who were told to start complying with regulations as of September 2021, after the government passed the nation\u2019s first piece of crypto-specific legislation in 2020.","The audit does not appear to have been scheduled, but over 100 other \u201Cdigital and electronic\u201D financial services providers working in the field of conventional finance will also be checked for their own AML compliance.","The regulators, along with the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), will test \u201Ccommon risk factors,\u201D as well as assess the adequacy of AML risk evaluation, in addition to factors such as transaction size, frequency, and more.","The probe will also focus on the implementation of customer verification protocols (also known as Know-Your-Customer, or KYC), the establishment of trading platforms\u2019 internal control systems, and the systems used to notify other parties of potential AML violations.","Interestingly for the sector, perhaps, the bodies will also check to see how effectively the crypto exchanges are preparing for the implementation of the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s much-maligned Travel Rule \u2013 which is set to be enshrined into South Korean law later this year.","All four of the exchanges have revealed they are working on their Travel Rule solutions. Upbit has developed its own solution, which operates via its operator Dunamu\u2019s blockchain subsidiary, while the remaining three have co-developed their own Travel Rule compliance platform.\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Crypto Exchanges in 2022: More Services, More Compliance, and Competition\n\u2013 2022 Crypto Regulation Trends: Focus on DeFi, Stablecoins, NFTs, and More\n\n\u2013 Prosecutors Want to Put \u2018Bogus\u2019 Crypto Exchange Chiefs Behind Bars for Life in Legal First\n\u2013 Upbit Crypto Exchange Traders to Face Fiat Services Disruptions over Lunar New Year Period"],"entity":[{"type":"Upbit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Coinone","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South Korean","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fiat Services Disruptions","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"KRW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Upbit Crypto Exchange Traders","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Exchange Chiefs Behind Bars","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"More Compliance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Supervisory Service (FSS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lunar New Year Period","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FIU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Financial Services Commission (FSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Action Task Force","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stablecoins","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Exchange","Regulation","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
