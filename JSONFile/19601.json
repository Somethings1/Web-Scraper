He also said that his division will expand \u201Cas appropriate\u201D in 2023.","According to Bloomberg, the digital asset team now has around 70 staff, up from just four people in 2020 when McDermott took over as head of the unit.","At the event, McDermott explained that he expects Goldman\u2019s blockchain platform to also be used for other assets than bonds in the future. Among the possibilities are alternative investments, fund units, derivatives and private equity.","For stock trading and initial public offerings (IPOs), however, McDermott said the blockchain platform will most likely not be used, given that systems currently in place are already efficient enough.","Bloomberg cited McDermott as saying that Goldman\u2019s blockchain platform potentially could make markets more efficient:","\u201CThe blockchain platform allows investors to see more data, have more transparency, more accurate pricing on an asset, which will then encourage more liquidity and hopefully bring in more investors in the secondary market.\u201D","Despite the potential for more efficient markets, McDermott admitted that large-scale tokenization of financial assets will still take time to gain traction due to regulatory issues. Still, the bank is committed to continue investing in its own blockchain program, as other banks, including JPMorgan, also move forward with their own blockchain plans."],"entity":[{"type":"Mathew McDermott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday this week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"McDermott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs \u2013","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Goldman Sachs"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
