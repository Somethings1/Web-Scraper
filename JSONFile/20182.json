Woori Financial is developing blockchain-based financial services. Woori is also looking to launch a blockchain-powered payment service through its Woori Card subsidiary, possibly making use of the Klaytn network.","Line, which could end up merging with the equally blockchain- and crypto-keen Yahoo Japan and its parent company SoftBank, is also building up its traditional finance sector ties.","Line has also been building up its conventional finance industry ties. Its fintech subsidiary LVC has recently announced a blockchain partnership with Nomura, Japan\u2019s oldest brokerage. Nomura has stumped up considerable investment funds for LVC in the past few months. Fn News claims that the companies are keen to combine Line\u2019s mobile app technology and user base with Nomura\u2019s traditional financial knowhow.","And Fn News states that the government is likely to ease the regulatory path for both Naver and Kakao due to the sheer size of the two companies \u2013 after the South Korean parliament last week voted in favor of a new set of cryptocurrency regulations.","\u201CIt is becoming more and more possible to run a legitimate cryptocurrency business entirely on-chain, without the need for existing financial infrastructure or even the support of traditional business. However, if we are to bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream public, there needs to be an alignment of the old and new financial worlds,\u201D Alexis Roussel, CEO and Co-Founder of Bity, a Swiss crypto-finance services provider, argued in an opinion piece. \u201CWithout this synchronization, current financial providers are just delaying inevitable transformation, and may be left behind as the new digital economy is built around them.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Woori Card","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shinhan Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nomura","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SoftBank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"fintech","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"keen Yahoo Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fn News","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Naver","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Woori Financial Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alexis Roussel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Woori Financial","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Banking","Blockchain"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
