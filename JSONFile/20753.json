For example, this was BTC\u2019s worst month on record, with a 40% drop.  ","Yet, after the initial shock of the market crash and all the massive issues surrounding companies such as Terra (LUNA), Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network (CEL), Voyager Digital, BlockFi, and others, the market finally saw green.","Looking at the top 10 coins by market capitalization clearly shows what a turn for the greener July had taken. All coins \u2013 except for one \u2013 saw double-digit increases (not taking stablecoins into consideration).","The undeniable winner of the month is ETH, with a rise of more than 58%. It is notable that the month was filled with the news of the upcoming Merge, when the project will move from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This has been tentatively scheduled for September.","ETH is followed by BNB, the native token of the Binance exchange, which went up 30%, as well as solana (SOL) and its 29% rise. Then come XRP and BTC, both of which appreciated more than 19% during the past month.","Finally, the last double-digit increase of nearly 15% was that of cardano (ADA), while the only coin that went up less than 10% is dogecoin (DOGE).","And the greenery continues in the top 50 category by market capitalization, where the throne is occupied by ethereum classic (ETH) \u2013 it appreciated nearly 150% in July. At one point in mid-July, ETC rallied in the market and outperformed ETH on a year-to-date basis. This is all happening as a narrative about Ethereum miners potentially switching over to Ethereum Classic as Ethereum transitions to PoS is gaining traction. Also, in late July, mining pool AntPool confirmed that it had invested USD 10m to support the Ethereum Classic ecosystem and plans to continue investing more.","The second in line is filecoin (FIL), which also went up over 100%, and while polygon (matic) and quant (QNT) were up over 90%, aave (AAVE) and uniswap (UNI) stood in the 72%-75% zone.","As for the other coins on this list, they all appreciated between 52% and 59%, while the only coin from the top 10 included here is ETH.","Observing the red-to-green ratio in the top 50 is always among the best ways to learn how the coins performed in the month behind us.  ","Indeed, today we see a completely opposite situation from the one exactly a month ago. Only one coin ended July in red in this category, and that is LEO, an exchange token issued by Bitfinex. Interestingly, this had been the best performer in the month of June.","There were plenty of green coins to talk about in July among the top 100 by market capitalization. The first place is occupied by lido DAO token (LDO), with a monthly increase of 365%. Lido Finance made news in July, as it announced that it aimed to expand services across various Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions, but it also put forward a proposal that turned out to be unacceptable \u2013 the community members voted against selling LDO 10m tokens to crypto investment firm Dragonfly Capital for DAI 14.5m, and the team soon came back with a second, \u201Cbetter\u201D, proposal.","LDO is followed by the already mentioned ETC, FIL, and MATIC. The second part of the ten best performers among the top 100 include bitcoin gold (BTG), QNT, curve DAO token (CRV), and convex finance (CVX), respectively \u2013 all of which are up between 95% and 80%. The last on the list is the troubled CEL, which, despite the mess it has found itself in, managed to finish July with a rise of 79%.","Not taking stablecoins into consideration, there were only four red coins among the 100. Huobi token (HT) is in the sixth place with a drop of 3%, the mentioned LEO is in the third place, the very troubled terra classic (LUNC) occupies the second place with a 17% fall, and in the first sits tenset (10SET) with a fall of 17%.  ","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Bad News is Good News: Bitcoin Plays With USD 24K as Traders Speculate on Fed Pivot and US Recession\n\u2013 Bitcoin Could Fall to USD 13.6K This Year, Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again\n\n\u2013 Volatile Months Ahead for Ethereum & USD 1,711 Likely for Year-End, Says Crypto Industry Panel\n\u2013 BNB to Grow Modestly This Year, Might Tripple by 2025 \u2013 Analyst Panel\n\n\u2013 Little Upside for Solana This Year, But Long-Term Future Remains Bright, Panel Predicts\n\u2013 Cardano Price to End Year at USD 0.63, Increasingly Bearish Panel Predicts\n\n\u2013 Dogecoin is Heading to Zero, According to Industry Panel\n\u2013 Global Economic Growth Slows Amid Gloomy and More Uncertain Outlook"],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"150%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"79%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Plays With USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"a month ago","content":"DATE"},{"type":"mid-July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dragonfly Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Industry Panel\n\u2013 Global Economic Growth Slows Amid Gloomy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CRV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"365%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"58%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Recession\n\u2013 Bitcoin Could Fall","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the month of June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum Classic","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FIL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"72%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"52%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again\n\n\u2013 Volatile Months Ahead for Ethereum & USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"29%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"MATIC","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"17%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Voyager Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Panel Predicts\n\u2013 Cardano Price","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Traders Speculate on Fed Pivot","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Increasingly Bearish Panel Predicts\n\n\u2013 Dogecoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crypto Industry Panel\n\u2013 BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"95%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Lido Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Bitcoin","BNB","Cardano","Dogecoin","Ethereum","Ethereum Classic","Market","Polygon","Solana","Uniswap"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
