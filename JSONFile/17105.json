Currently, miners\u2019 Bitcoin holdings stand at 1,812,482 BTC, with some miners looking to take profits following the recent Bitcoin price hike.","Miners\u2019 offload since January totaled $530 million, with serious fees following into centralized exchanges and other custodians.","The Bitcoin and entire cryptocurrency ecosystem braces for the next halving in April, which will reduce block rewards by 50%. Miners receive 6.25 BTC per block with the slash bringing rewards down to 3.125 BTC.","The halving event takes place every four years, and although rewards are slashed, it is generally perceived as a bullish activity. This is based on statistically increasing asset prices following halving due to the reduced supply.","Several crypto commentators opine that miners seek to bank on the higher processing fees before the slash in rewards.","Following the 2022 bear market, miners posted huge losses leading to focus pivots to Artificial Intelligence (AI), computing, and the sale of Bitcoin reserves to stay afloat.","Some miners also sold equipment to competitors and merged due to plunging asset prices. Following the uptick recorded with BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application, the Bitcoin price gained momentum, giving miners a lifeline.","Miners began posting quarterly profits as more institutional funds flowed into the market, causing a price uptick and wiping out losses of the previous year.","In December, Bitcoin miners offloaded $129 million worth of Bitcoin in a day to centralized exchanges after a brief selling pressure.","In a notable move, #Bitcoin miners have sold over 3,000 #BTC in just the last 24 hours, amounting to approximately $129 million.
