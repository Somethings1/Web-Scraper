Additionally, they proposed funding for cross-government AI research and development, including initiatives for AI-ready data and government AI testing and evaluation infrastructure.","\u201CIf China is going to invest $50 billion, and we\u2019re going to invest in nothing, they\u2019ll inevitably get ahead of us. So that\u2019s why even these investments are so important,\u201D Schumer stated.","Many commentators believe the senator\u2019s AI investment plan could help the country address increasing concerns about China\u2019s advancement in the sector. Washington fears that Beijing could use AI for malicious purposes, such as meddling in the Presidential elections or launching cyberattacks.","Additionally, the US lawmakers recommended the creation of a federal data privacy law and expressed support for legislation to prevent the use of \u201Cdeepfake technology in election campaigns.\u201D They also called for regulatory measures to address issues such as health and financial discrimination, job displacement, and copyright violations caused by AI.","We must put rules of the road in place for AI. That\u2019s why Leader Schumer and Senators Rounds, Heinrich, and Young worked on a bipartisan roadmap for where we must take action, including areas I\u2019ve focused on like our elections, protecting journalism, and increasing transparency.","\u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) May 15, 2024","","Commenting on the latest senator\u2019s AI investment proposal, Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, expressed support for the recommended framework for AI, particularly in Journalism, where copyright infringement has been an issue.","Meanwhile, US Senators are sounding the alarm about AI\u2019s threat to elections, specifically its potential to deceive voters.","To this end, the Senate Rules Committee advanced three bills on May 15 to combat this issue \u2013 the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, the AI Transparency in Elections Act, and the Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act.","I held a Senate Rules Committee hearing on ensuring that every eligible American can make their voices heard when they cast their ballots. From protecting poll workers to putting in guardrails on AI, more needs to be done to support our election administrators. pic.twitter.com\/sPwaLkZzRs","\u2014 Senator Amy Klobuchar (@SenAmyKlobuchar) March 15, 2024","","The Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar and co-sponsored by Senator Josh Hawley, would prohibit using AI video or audio related to federal candidates.","The AI Transparency in Elections Act would require AI disclosures in political ads, while the Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act would develop guidelines to counter external AI threats, especially from foreign adversaries.","Recent incidents underscore the importance of these bills. In February, a robocall impersonating President Joe Biden and a video from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019 campaign last June using AI-generated images of former President Donald Trump have exposed the dangers of AI in elections.","FAKE BIDEN ROBO-CALL TELLS NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS TO STAY HOME (Reuters)","As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast their votes in the state's first-in-the nation primary Tuesday, a robo-call is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home \u2013 using a fake audio of U.S.\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/PB4D1yD8pv","\u2014 FXHedge (@Fxhedgers) January 22, 2024","","These incidents highlight the urgent need for measures to protect the integrity of democratic processes from AI-based deception, which the EU has also been working on.","Recall that the EU set a precedent by passing the AI Regulation Act in March 2024 and has gone grill Big Tech on AI risks to elections.
