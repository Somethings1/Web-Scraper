However, he might have helped the promoters of the \u201Cbitcoin is digital gold\u201D narrative.","Charlie Munger. Source: A video screenshot, Youtube\/Yahoo Finance","Speaking at the Daily Journal\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders, Munger, 97, took a swipe at bitcoin (BTC), saying, per CNBC,","\u201CBitcoin reminds me of what Oscar Wilde said about fox hunting. He said it was the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.\u201D","He dismissed the notion that bitcoin could become a \u201Cmedium of exchange for the world,\u201D claiming it was \u201Ctoo volatile to serve well.\u201D","He added,","\u201CIt\u2019s really kind of an artificial substitute for gold. And since I never buy any gold, I never buy any bitcoin.\u201D","Munger waded into the ongoing Robinhood-GameStop shares debate, opining, according to Reuters,","\u201CIt\u2019s really stupid to have a culture which encourages as much gambling in stocks by people who have the mindset of racetrack bettors. A lot of them crowd in to buying stocks on frenzy, frequently on credit, because they see that they\u2019re going up, and of course that\u2019s a very dangerous way to invest.\u201D","He warned that trouble could be ahead for newer retail traders, saying that he thinks that \u201Cit must end badly, but I don\u2019t know when.\u201D","And it appears that Munger is not the only influential business leader who has expressed his disdain for recent crypto goings-on.","The boss of European fintech firm Klarna Sebastian Siemiatkowski claimed that he was concerned about the role of Twiter in bitcoin promotion, opining that regulators needed to act to protect people from losing money.","He told CNBC,","\u201CIf I go on Twitter and search for bitcoin, I can see people writing: \u2018Buy now or you\u2019re going to miss the biggest opportunity of your life. If I [advertised] Klarna stock with similar writing I would get a fine or I would even be put to jail. I am very surprised why regulators aren\u2019t chasing these elements.\u201D","Munger has had run-ins with the crypto community before. In 2018, he urged Washington to \u201Cstep on\u201D crypto \u201Chard\u201D in a China-style crackdown. He labeled crypto as a \u201Ctotally asinine\u201D phenomenon and dismissed bitcoin as a \u201Cnoxious poison.\u201D","In 2019, he doubled down on the rage, claiming crypto project managers were fans of \u201CJudas Iscariot.\u201D","On Twitter, Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital accused Munger of hypocrisy, saying that it was ironic that Munger thought Robinhood was a \u201Cdirty way to make money while he told people to take it easy on his portfolio company Wells Fargo after they were fined USD 3 billion for breaking the law\u201D \u2013 a reference to a legal case settled last year with the American Department of Justice (DOJ).","The DOJ wrote at the time that between 2002 and 2016, Wells Fargo had been accused of \u201Cpressuring employees to meet unrealistic sales goals that led thousands of employees to provide millions of accounts or products to customers under false pretenses or without consent, often by creating false records or misusing customers\u2019 identities.\u201D","Pompliano bristled:","\u201CGuess it is only dirty profits when they aren\u2019t going in his pockets!\u201D","___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin Stash Surpassed USD 4.5B And They Want More\n\u2013 1 Million First-time Buyers Bought Bitcoin on Dorsey\u2019s Cash App Last Month\n\u2013 1,400+ Firms Flock To Learn About Bitcoin, But \u2018There Is No Playbook\u2019\n\u2013 Microsoft CEO Claims No Plan To Follow In Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin-buying Footsteps\n\u2013 A Wave of Giants Rushing to Invest in Bitcoin Could Derail the Stock Market\n\u2013 Bitcoin Snowball Is Expected To Hit More Institutions in 2021"],"entity":[{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Giants Rushing to Invest","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yahoo Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Klarna Sebastian Siemiatkowski","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Berkshire Hathaway","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Microsoft","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Munger","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anthony Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Morgan Creek Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Oscar Wilde","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dorsey\u2019s Cash App Last Month","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Robinhood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2002","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wells Fargo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"American Department of Justice (DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Charlie Munger","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Warren Buffett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Anthony Pompliano","Bitcoin","Investing","Robinhood"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
