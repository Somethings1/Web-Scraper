Genesis Global Holdco LLC, plus subsidiaries Genesis Global Capital LLC and Genesis Asia Pacific Pte, were included in the bankruptcy filing. ","The bankruptcy filing revealed that the top 50 unsecured claims totaled around $3.4 billion, with $1.2 billion owed to Earn users.","Genesis has been largely unable to reach a definitive settlement with its creditors, which has resulted in months-long delays and pressure from individual creditors to resolve financial matters as soon as possible. ","\u201CAs a creditor who has diligently been following the proceeding, I, along with many others, have observed a concerning absence of substantial progress in resolving the financial matters at hand,\u201D wrote creditor Yosif Sharif. ","The proceedings have been further complicated by lawsuits and actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the company over its customer lending program, Earn. ","In early June, a bankruptcy judge granted them additional time to come up with a revised payout proposal.","Genesis now has through August 2, 2023 to file its plan. The company originally intended to extend the period until August 27.","The extended deadline is dependent on the company\u2019s continued cooperation with its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors toward a plan. The Committee can request a motion to terminate the extended filing period with seven days\u2019 notice if discussions break down."," "],"entity":[{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Yosif Sharif","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$175 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"August 27","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$835 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$355 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$275 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$900 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"August 2, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Holdco LLC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4 p.m.","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Genesis Asia Pacific Pte","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cameron Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Earn","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Genesis Global Capital LLC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Gemini"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
