Nothing like that is remotely close to happening anytime soon.\u201D","Powell informed the committee that if the Fed were to explore a digital dollar, it would work with banks to manage accounts, strictly avoiding any form of direct government monitoring of individual transactions.","\u201CWe would never entertain the idea of having government accounts that allow us to see all your transactions. That\u2019s simply not something we would support, do, or even propose in the United States,\u201D claimed Powell.","The privacy of the U.S. citizens has been the primary concern of the lawmakers who have attempted to prevent the issuance of the digital dollar.","In February, Republican Senators introduced a bill intended to ban Fed-backed CBDCs.
