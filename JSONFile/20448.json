South Korea is due to go to the polls twice next year, and campaigning is already beginning to ramp up.","Lee and his office claimed that his platform would be up and running by mid-January next year, and was quoted as saying:","\u201CWe are currently in the process of selecting a domestic wallet company to partner with. We will unveil the wallet address and details on our official blog, Facebook, and YouTube channels in early January.\u201D","The report noted that this would be the \u201Cfirst time that a domestic politician has announced that they were prepared to receive political support in the form of cryptoassets.\u201D","Yonhap also pointed out that in the United States, the crypto-keen Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis had previously accepted donations made in bitcoin via crypto payment providers.","Lee\u2019s office says it is conducting the project as an \u201Cexperiment,\u201D but plans to receive up to USD 8,400 in crypto donations ahead of the March elections. The platform will cap individual crypto donations at USD 840 per donor.","The platform will also be compatible with \u201Ctwo or three\u201D altcoins, in addition to BTC and ETH. However, Lee\u2019s office has not yet decided what these coins will be. Yonhap noted that these coins were \u201Cexpected to be selected from\u201D a pool of high-cap coins listed by domestic companies.","Lee\u2019s office says its platform is compliant with the terms of the Public Official Election Act and the Political Fund Management Rules, the protocols governing political donations.","The office added that it would update the public with details of how fiat KRW tax deductions could be applied \u2013 as, under South Korean law, all political donations are tax-deductible.","Lee was quoted as explaining:","\u201CThis is a time when innovative experiments are needed to change the perception of virtual assets and NFTs across the political spectrum. We need to boost our understanding of emerging technology.\u201D","_____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 South Korea\u2019s Potential Next President Calls Crypto \u2018A Means of Trading & Investment\u2019\n\u2013 How and Why Crypto Suffers from Unfair Treatment by Regulators, Politicians & Media\n\n\u2013 Argentina\u2019s President Calls Crypto a \u2018Hard Currency\u2019 that Can Fight Inflation\n\u2013 US National Republican Congressional Committee to Accept Crypto Donations"],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Why Crypto Suffers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yonhap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Democratic Party","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"KRW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Politicians & Media\n\n\u2013 Argentina\u2019s President Calls Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Facebook","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lee Kwang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US National Republican Congressional Committee to Accept Crypto Donations","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cynthia Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Political Fund Management Rules","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Unfair Treatment","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Potential Next President Calls Crypto \u2018A Means of Trading & Investment","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","Ethereum","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Politics","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
