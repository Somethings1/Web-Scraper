The product allowed users to tender their crypto assets in exchange for industry-high interest rates. The SEC claims the product is a security and thus Nexo should have registered with the agency. ","\u201CWe are not concerned with the labels put on offerings, but on their economic realities. And part of that reality is that crypto assets are not exempt from the federal securities laws,\u201D said Gurbir Grewal, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, adding:","\u201CIf you\u2019re offering or selling products that constitute securities under well-established laws and legal precedent, then no matter what you call those products, you\u2019re subject to those laws and we expect compliance.\u201D","Launched in 2018, Nexo is a British digital asset lending company that loans out client funds and uses the proceeds to pay interest. The company first went head to head with US officials in September 2022 after several states, including California, Vermont, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Maryland, filed cease-and-desist orders against the company.","In a press release, Nexo said the settlement is on a no-admit-no-deny basis. In other words, the company did not admit or deny any wrongdoing. Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev said:","\u201CWe are content with this unified resolution which unequivocally puts an end to all speculations around Nexo\u2019s relations to the United States. We can now focus on what we do best \u2013 build seamless financial solutions for our worldwide audience.\u201D","As reported, Nexo\u2019s Bulgarian offices were raided by local police last week, with authorities investigating suspected money laundering, tax offenses, computer fraud, and other violations. Subsequently, the crypto lender saw a wave of withdrawals. ","It is worth noting that Nexo is one of the many crypto lending companies that hasn\u2019t gone out of business. Other major crypto lenders, including Celsius, BlockFi, and most recently the crypto lending unit of Genesis, have all filed for bankruptcy amid the recent market downturn. "],"entity":[{"type":"June 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Maryland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South Carolina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nexo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$22.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Vermont","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kentucky","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$45 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Antoni Trenchev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gurbir Grewal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nexo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the North American Securities Administrators Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Oklahoma","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Lending","SEC","Securities and Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
