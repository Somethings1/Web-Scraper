Following the acquisition of London-based crypto exchange Coinpass in 2023, the firm has a FCA registration.","OANDA is a global brokerage and already has regulated entities in New York, Toronto, London, Warsaw, Singapore, Tokyo, and Sydney, according to the broker\u2019s website.","\u201CThe UK has a high level of participation and is a very well-educated and active market,\u201D said  OANDA\u2019s head of digital assets Lucian Lauerman in an interview with CoinDesk.","\u201CWhat we liked about the opportunity in the UK when it comes to crypto, is that it\u2019s becoming more aligned with the markets where we\u2019ve traditionally operated. The regulatory bar has been set slightly higher,\u201D added Lauerman.","The brokerage added that the move to launch the trading platform builds on OANDA\u2019s August acquisition of a majority interest in Coinpass Limited.","Recently the FCA conducted internal reviews on 44 cryptocurrency firms registered in the country to tackle money laundering concerns. In a Feb 14 release, the regulator highlighted key areas in the UK markets including digital assets regulations.
