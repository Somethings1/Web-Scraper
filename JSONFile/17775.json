Alternatively, the new product can also be used to refinance a property a client already owns, all without selling any coins.","The product thus differs from common decentralized lending and borrowing services that typically do not allow users to borrow amounts close to 100% of their collateral. Ledn is able to get around this by accepting both the bitcoin and real estate as \u201Cjoin collateral,\u201D the company\u2019s website explained.","Meanwhile, the company also announced today that it has concluded a Series B funding round that brought its valuation to USD 540m.","According to the announcement, the company successfully raised USD 70m in the round, which was led by 10T Holdings, an investment fund managed by the macro investor Dan Tapiero.","The round was also joined by all existing investors, including Coinbase Ventures, White Star Capital, and Kingsway Capital, among others. New investors after the round included Golden Tree Asset Management and Raptor Group and FJ Labs, the company said.","In addition to leading the funding round, 10T Holdings CEO Dan Tapiero will join Ledn\u2019s board of directors.\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Check These 5 Ways to Earn Yield on Your Crypto\n\u2013 Crypto Loans Boom\n\n\u2013 NFT-Backed Lending Market Rises, USD 1.4M Borrowed With an NFT as Collateral\n\n\u2013 DeFi Has Had a Strong 2021, Driven By New Trends & Paradigms\n\u2013 Coinbase Mulls Ethereum Collateral Amid Lending Program Expansion"],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"end of the first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Raptor Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ledn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kingsway Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10T Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dan Tapiero","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"New Trends & Paradigms\n\u2013 Coinbase Mulls Ethereum Collateral Amid Lending Program Expansion","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Golden Tree Asset Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Adam Reeds","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Financial Services","Investment","Lending"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
