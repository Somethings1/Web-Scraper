Put succinctly, Meme Kombat captures the latent value of arguably the top-valued sectors in crypto today \u2013 gaming and gambling.","","At its current price of $0.00000115, Pepe Coin ($PEPE) has an enormous market cap of close to $500 million, a staggering achievement considering the coin offers literally no utility to its investors, beyond the sense that they are part of the admittedly large and engaged Pepe Coin community.","Of course, there is a lot of value in networks of highly engaged individuals, something which Pepe certainly has.","But as the crypto market enters its next bull cycle, one feature of the maturing nature of this market is that investors are becoming more demanding in what they expect from a coin.","Those higher expectations are also being put onto new memes coins.","Increasingly, meme coin investors are flocking towards projects that are offering genuinely unique and potentially valuable use cases \u2013 for a project to succeed now, there has to be a value differential.","Meme Kombat fits the bill perfectly.
