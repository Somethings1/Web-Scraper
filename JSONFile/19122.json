Load testing will continue before the phased release of permissioned testnet and public testnet,\u201D Monad CEO Keone told Cryptonews. \u201CMonad is a deep engineering effort to deliver performant parallel EVM. We\u2019re excited to share our team\u2019s advances in parallel EVM execution and performant state access later this year.\u201D","Monad\u2019s impending arrival comes at a time when congestion and high fees continue to plague the network. The demand for scalable layer 1 solutions that can build on Ethereum\u2019s solid foundations is higher than ever.","Monad Devnet is live.","10,000 real TPS achieved on the EVM. pic.twitter.com\/1bnfsi6bqU","\u2014 Monad (evm\/acc) (@monad_xyz) March 14, 2024","","At Monad\u2019s core is a new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) designed from scratch to use parallelized execution and a pipelined architecture. This allows transaction processing to occur simultaneously, rather than sequentially, enabling vastly higher throughput.","By remaining bytecode compatible, Monad promises to ensure seamless integration with the ecosystem of Ethereum-based dApps and DeFi protocols. Developers will be able to port their decentralized applications to Monad without extensive reworking.","A key benefit of Monad\u2019s architecture is the ability to finalize blocks instantly after generation, eliminating the long confirmation times that often frustrate Ethereum users. Monad is able to achieve this by decoupling execution from consensus.","In addition, Monad implements a one-second block time to maximize throughput. This presents potential difficulties for node operators, however, as the hardware requirements are roughly twice that of Ethereum.","Venture capital firm Paradigm, a key backer of several prominent industry startups, is reportedly leading a fundraising round of over $200 million for Monad Labs. This round, which would follow a $19 million seed round in February 2023, places a $3 billion valuation on Monad Labs.","Paradigm has already committed $150 million and has been gauging interest from additional investors since late 2023. A successful raise of this magnitude would mark the largest crypto-related funding round of 2024 to date, according to Crunchbase\u2019s Web3 Tracker.","EigenLayer got $100M from a16z, Eclipse just got a $50M round and now Monad might get $200M of which $150M comes from Paradigm goes to show VCs are definitely circling the waters now.

This will enable rigorous real-world testing of the network\u2019s performance and capabilities.","The Monad mainnet is slated to follow later in the year. The project has generated excitement and anticipation in the Ethereum community, with developers eager to leverage Monad\u2019s scalability.","If Monad can deliver on its promise of high throughput and instant finality while retaining Ethereum\u2019s security guarantees, it may very well offer the push that finally brings crypto to the masses."],"entity":[{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Paradigm","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monad Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 11, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 14","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$19 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crunchbase\u2019s Web3 Tracker","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Keone","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$150M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monad","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$200M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"late 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$200 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$50M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"TPS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$150 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Devnet","Ethereum","Monad"],"authors":["Trent Alan"]}
