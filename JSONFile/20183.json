CTO David Schwartz Hints","category":["Altcoin News "],"content":["Ripple is reportedly planning to launch its much-anticipated USD-backed XRP stablecoin, the company\u2019s CTO hints at an event.","The information surfaced during the XRP Las Vegas conference on May 3-4, where David Schwartz, the chief technology officer of Ripple, revealed the firm\u2019s upcoming integrations. He presented information on XRP Ledger, including automated market makers (AMM), lending protocol, Ripple stablecoin and AI.","Infos about @Ripple's stablecoin is expected to be announced in a month at the XRPL Apex event in Amsterdam \u2013 @JoelKatz üî•\npic.twitter.com\/wuuhKJ8ot9","\u2014 Jim_Knox (@JimKnox123) May 4, 2024","","Schwartz noted that details on the Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be disclosed next month during the XRPL Apex event in Amsterdam.","The proposed stablecoin by Ripple is supposed to be backed 1-to-1 by US Dollar deposits, US government bonds and other low-risk investments. The mere mention of the development of a Ripple stablecoin by Schwartz, sparked interests among the XRP community.","Per the announcement made by the firm last month, the idea of a stablecoin is to drive more use-cases, liquidity and opportunity for developers and users. It is also aimed at creating a more trustworthy alternative to assets like Tether\u2019s (USDT) and Circle\u2019s (USDC).","Further, the launch of a stablecoin is expected to be a game changer for the entire XRP Ledger ecosystem as the market is highly lucrative.","Ripple\u2019s move into the stablecoin market, announced last month, comes after Bitcoin recorded a staggering high of $73,000 this year.","The recent US SEC\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETFs approval, has spurred a new wave of venture capital into speculative projects.","Markus Infanger, senior vice-president at Ripple, said the stablecoin would act as a \u201Cportal,\u201D bridging traditional capital and crypto markets.","\u201COur assessment of the market shows very clearly stablecoins are playing an important role,\u201D Infanger noted at the time. \u201CThey\u2019re here to stay and they\u2019ve been growing significantly, and we firmly believe the growth will continue to be strong.\u201D","The stablecoin market in the recent times has been more competitive. Last month, Nick van Eck, the son of investment manager Jan van Eck, raised $12 million to launch a stablecoin. Payments giant PayPal and French bank Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale both launched their own stablecoins last year."],"entity":[{"type":"Amsterdam","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 3","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$73,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$12 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Las Vegas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 4, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Markus Infanger","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nick van Eck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Schwartz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CTO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Schwartz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ripple","Stablecoin","XRP"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
