So, when there\u2019s a new technology, we embrace it,\u201D he said.","\u201CWe were like the second nation to launch the eNaira app. The app has many uses and advantages. It can be programmed.\u201D","Furthermore, the eNaira app offers various programmable features that enhance its practicality and functionality. ","For example, it can be programmed to be used within specific locations or for specific items, which makes it particularly useful for executing intervention programs. ","Authorities can also ensure that funds are allocated only for the intended purposes, preventing misuse or diversion. ","\u201CThat\u2019s the beauty of it. Speed of transaction, reduction of settlement risks have all been taken care of by the CBN\u2019s eNaira.\u201D","Nigeria launched the eNaira in 2021, becoming one of the very first countries in the world to offer a CBDC. ","However, initial adoption rates fell below expectations, prompting the CBN to explore various strategies to drive usage. ","For one, the central bank has introduced use cases in the transport sector and integrated USSD functionality into the eNaira offering. ","Despite these efforts, former CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele attributed the slow growth of the eNaira to commercial banks prioritizing their profitability over the CBDC\u2019s expansion.","It is worth noting that Nigeria\u2019s central bank had previously banned banks and financial institutions from facilitating transactions in digital currencies in 2021. ","However, despite the ban, residents in Africa\u2019s most populous country still make up the largest volume of digital token transactions done on peer-to-peer trading platforms outside of the United States."],"entity":[{"type":"NFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Joseph Angaye","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Godwin Emefiele","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nigeria","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CBN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the University of Abuja","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Near Field Communication (NFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
