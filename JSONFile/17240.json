Â CertiK said this case study not only underscores the critical role of proactive security practices but also celebrates the power of open-source software in raising security and transparency standards across the Web3 world.","Wormhole supports the transfer of tokens and data across different blockchain networks. The crypto project was spun off by Jump Trading Group and is one of the most popular bridges linking the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.","In 2022, Wormhole lost about $321 million in an exploit. Hackers compromised Wormhole Bridge leading to 120,000 wETH loss from the platform, equivalent to $321 million. It was the largest DeFi attack of 2022 and the hacker swapped wETH tokens with Ethereum, SOL, USDC, APE, SX, etc.","An investigation conducted by pseudonymous researcher Pland, detailed in an X post on April 4th, revealed that the Wormhole team overlooked excluding several wallet addresses associated with the exploit that drained $321 million in crypto from the cross-chain bridge.","Chainalysis said to understand why the 2022 attack was more serious than the average hack, it is important to know how cross-chain bridges work.","\u201CUsers interact with cross-chain bridges by sending funds in one asset to the bridge protocol, where those funds are then locked into the contract. The user is then issued equivalent funds of a parallel asset on the chain the protocol bridges to. In the case of Wormhole, users typically send Ether (ETH) to the protocol, where it is held as collateral, and are issued WeETH on Solana, backed by that collateral locked in the Wormhole contract on Ethereum,\u201D \u2014 Chainalysis: Lessons from the Wormhole Exploit.","April 2024 saw the lowest combined losses from crypto-related hacks and scams, with CertiK reporting approximately $25.7 million lost to exploits, hacks, and scams.","This latest figure marks the lowest recorded hacks since CertiK began tracking such incidents in 2021, as flash loan attacks and private critical hacks decreased."],"entity":[{"type":"April 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$25.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$321 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jump Trading Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 4th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["CertiK","Exploit","Wormhole"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
