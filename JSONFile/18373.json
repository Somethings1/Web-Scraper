If they stop with the more tolerable lower fees available on pro, then they are basically saying they don\u2019t want high volume traders using their platform,\u201D another user said.","Yep, once I was told about it I never went back to regular Coinbase to buy or sell\n\nJust buy off Coinbase Pro and then transfer","However, Coinbase has said that the Advanced Trade service will offer \u201Cthe same volume-based fees as Coinbase Pro.\u201D The service is already available for desktop users, and the exchange aims to roll out a mobile version of the feature in the near future.","Meanwhile, Coinbase\u2019s latest move comes as the rival crypto exchange Binance.US announced that it is eliminating all trading fees on bitcoin (BTC) trades made with US dollar-backed stablecoins.","\u201CWe see this as an opportunity to revolutionize the way fees are approached in our industry, increase accessibility to crypto, and better support our market and customers in a time of need,\u201D Brian Shroder, CEO of Binance.US, said in a blog post.","The best #crypto platform for low fees just got better. #BinanceUS is the first major platform to offer zero-fee #bitcoin trades for BTC\/USD, BTC\/USDT, BTC\/USDC & BTC\/BUSD spot pairs, for all users without trading volume requirements.\n\nRead: https:\/\/t.co\/UYvNNvael2 pic.twitter.com\/YDV0x3dfcJ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Coinbase Says It Is Targeting More Users, Not Lower Fees\n\u2013 Coinbase Says It Grew Too Quickly and Now Lays Off 1,100 Employees\n\n\u2013 Coinbase\u2019s Armstrong Reportedly Spends USD 133M On New LA Home, This Is How It Looks\n\u2013 FTX Overtook Coinbase & OKX in May\n\n\u2013 Binance Shares What Caused Backlog on Bitcoin Network, Resumes BTC Withdrawals\n\u2013 Binance Claims It\u2019s Probably The Only Crypto Exchange That Has A Responsible Trading Program"],"entity":[{"type":"USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase Pro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Advanced Trade","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX Overtook Coinbase & OKX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Shroder","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Armstrong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Resumes BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USDC & BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","Exchange","Fees","Trading"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
