In fact, it was part of a larger TikTok-centered campaign to inflate the coin's price.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDogecoin is practically worthless,\u201D he explained. \u201CThere are 800 million TikTok users, invest just $25.

Tell everyone you know.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The video, which has garnered roughly 63K likes and 5,000 comments, is far from the only one.

The cryptocurrency also took the top trending spot on Twitter late Tuesday night.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dogecoin is a Litecoin-based cryptocurrency that was launched as a joke in December 2013 by U.S.-based programmers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who borrowed the name and logo from an internet meme. Since then, somewhat of a cult community has formed around the coin, predominantly on Reddit and Twitter.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The current price of Dogecoin is at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/price\/dogecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$0.0037<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, after peaking at $0.0048 on Tuesday.
