The rule obliged owners of crypto assets to carry out real-name transactions. The unnamed exchange reported Kim\u2019s transactions to the state-run Korea Financial Intelligence Unit which subsequently filed the case to South Korean prosecutors. The MP rejects the accusations, and claims that he had not cashed out most of his crypto holdings, but transferred them to a different exchange. ","Kim is also defending himself by saying that he was not required to report his crypto holdings under the disclosure obligation of the country\u2019s public service ethics act.","\u201CI did not borrow and receive money from anyone at all (for the crypto trading),\u201D the lawmaker declared. \u201CI sold some of my stocks to use for the initial crypto investment. I also made transactions only through real-name accounts and I can transparently share all of the transaction records.","Kim is an MP for the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), South Korea\u2019s s main opposition party. The DPK is the largest party in the National Assembly, the lower chamber of the country\u2019s parliament, with 168 lawmakers, and it opposes the People Power Party (PPP) of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. ","The PPP has blasted the opposition lawmaker as both parties are intensifying their rivalry ahead of South Korea\u2019s forthcoming parliamentary election. The vote is expected to take place in April 2024. ","\u201CThe public is shocked by his ambivalent attitude and attempts to gain sympathy by highlighting his cheap shoes, even though he held crypto assets worth 6 billion won,\u201D said Yoo Sang-bum, a lawmaker and spokesperson for the PPP.","The ruling party\u2019s politician was referring to Kim\u2019s efforts to present himself as a modest public servant who seeks to represent the socially vulnerable segments of South Korea\u2019s population. ","Meanwhile, Hong Joon-pyo, who is the mayor of Daegu and a politician of the PPP, has also called on Kim to resign his post.","\u201CThis is a serious moral hazard,\u201D the mayor said. \u201CHe appeared to have had a get-rich-quick scheme with crypto trading. He should have left his job as a lawmaker and focused on speculative trading instead. On top of that, he stood at the forefront of delaying crypto taxation, which can be seen as an abuse of his legislative power for the protection of his private assets.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"April 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hong Joon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Yoon Suk Yeol","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"PPP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"KRW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Democratic Party of Korea (DPK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Daegu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Korea Financial Intelligence Unit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Yoo Sang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"National Assembly","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"People Power Party (PPP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DPK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kim Nam","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"6 billion ($4.5 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Politics","South Korea"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
