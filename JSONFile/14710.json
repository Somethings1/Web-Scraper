Specifically, the proposal will allow users to batch transactions and sign off on them all at once.","Another one of the main changes likely to occur in Pectra will be a lift to the staking limit for validators, from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH \u2013 a 64-fold increase. That proposal, known as EIP 7251, would allow large staking providers, like Coinbase or Lido, to consolidate their validators operating the Ethereum blockchain \u2013 while allowing them to avoid constantly creating new validators every time they have another 32 ETH to stake.","According to Dune Analytics, over 1 million validators are currently operating the Ethereum network, which has led to concern over excessive latency. Developers have been looking for ways to slow the rate at which new validators enter the system \u2013 potentially bogging it down. EIP 2751 is pitched as a way to lighten the operational load for larger stakers, consolidate the number of validators on the blockchain, and allow staking providers to deploy less resources to staking and validating.","The name \"Pectra\" is a portmanteau of two simultaneous upgrades happening on the different layers of the blockchain. The execution layer, where protocol rules are enforced, will undergo the \"Prague\" upgrade, and the consensus layer, which ensures that blocks are validated, will go through the \"Electra\" upgrade.","Ethereum developers are known for Brangelina-ing their upgrades, like the previous one where the simultaneous Deneb and Cancun upgrades were referred to as \u201CDencun,\u201D (and \u201CShapella\u201D prior to that.) The Ethereum naming convention follows the different cities that Devcon took place in for the execution layer, and for the consensus layer, it follows an alphabetical order of the name of stars.","Other EIPs for consideration include triggering validator withdrawals from smart contracts, adding a code change known as BLS precompile, and removing the deposit window. These are relatively small changes to the network for the developers to work on.","The upgrade following Pectra will include long-awaited \"verkle trees\" \u2013 a new type of data system designed to help Ethereum nodes store large amounts of data.","Beiko said developers would aim to push Pectra out sometime at the end of 2024, maybe early 2025. \u201CIt's going to be a relatively small upgrade. The reason for that is that it allows us to work on two forks in parallel. We are working on Verkle trees and that transition,\u201D Beiko said. \u201CWe are working on that but it's going to take more than a year. So in the meantime we have bandwidth to work on other small wins.\u201D","Read more: Ethereum Finalizes 'Dencun' Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees","Edited by Sam Kessler and Bradley Keoun."],"entity":[{"type":"BLS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cancun","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Reduce Data Fees","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bradley Keoun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Prague","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tim Beiko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lido","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dune Analytics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"3074","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Etheruem All Core Developers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Beiko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Pectra","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Deneb","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dencun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Devcon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brangelina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Pectra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Kessler","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Upgrade","Staking","Eth staking","Ether","ETH"],"authors":["Margaux Nijkerk"]}
