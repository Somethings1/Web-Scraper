At the time, the idea of \u201CCrypto + AI\u201D was still a novel concept. Even fringe. To many, AI development felt adjacent \u2014 at best \u2014 to the world of Web3. To others, \u201CCrypto + AI\u201D felt like a cynical mix of two hype-y trends, like VC mad libs.","Flash forward one year.","Decentralized AI is arguably the hottest topic in the web3 space. Dozens of projects \u2014 maybe hundreds, it\u2019s hard to keep track \u2014 are now racing to merge the tools of blockchain with the taming of AI. The space is booming. By the time you finish reading this article, another DePIN startup will have launched. And the architects of this movement are converging in Austin, for Consensus 2024, in CoinDesk\u2019s inaugural \u201CAI Summit.\u201D (I\u2019ll cop to some bias: I helped organize the event and I\u2019ll be hosting on May 31.)","So why is this happening, and why does it matter?","You could argue that the stakes of decentralized AI are higher than the stakes of decentralized finance. In some ways the principles are the same. Satoshi Nakamoto was wary of centralized financial institutions that acted badly and jeopardized people\u2019s money. As AI becomes a greater part of our lives \u2014 and that feels inevitable \u2014 it will have the power to shape how we see the world, how we interact with the world, and how we present to the world. It could shape how we think. Should this be controlled by the billionaire de jour?","Let\u2019s look at two concrete examples, one that\u2019s straightforward and one that\u2019s chilling. The next frontier of Gen AI is likely the rise of AI agents, which can do things like book your flight, pay your phone bill, or invest your money in stocks. (\u201CHey Siri, go ahead and put $1,000 in the S&P.\u201D)","Do we want Big Tech to control not just our data, but also what we do with it?","More chilling: It\u2019s likely that millions of people will someday use AI chatbots \u2014 perhaps through audio or even video \u2014 as coaches or even therapists. Early versions are here now. (On my podcast AI-Curious, for example, I interviewed a longtime coach who\u2019s working with the German Research Center to develop AI-based personal coaching. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s inevitable.) Millions of people will share their inner-most thoughts, longings, fears, sexual desires, confessions and embarrassments. Do we want this sliced and diced by Zuckerberg and co.? The decentralized and privacy-preserving tech of blockchain, potentially, could give us the fruits of AI without the poison of Big Tech.","These are the stakes of decentralized AI. These are the topics covered at the AI Summit. (Or some of the topics. Others include how blockchain can help us preserve truth in an era of deepfakes, fight censorship, make \u201CAI compute\u201D more inclusive, fight bias, lead to AI alignment, and on and on.)","While an explosion of AI + Crypto projects have launched since 2022, some have been around for years and have been quietly building. One is Singularity NET, founded in 2017 by Ben Goertzel, a prominent AI researcher, with an early vision of building decentralized AI. \u201CMy initial vision for what became SingularityNET occurred to me in \u201995 or \u201996, when the internet became a thing,\u201D Goertzel told me recently in Panama City, at an AI conference hosted by Singularity. \u201CIt seemed to me, the internet shouldn\u2019t be centralized. The internet is a decentralized network. So why would you want to have a centralized search service?\u201D The seeds of this idea included AI (which he has studied since the 80s), and Goertzel has the receipts: A 2001 book \u201CCreating Internet Intelligence\u201D that fuses all these concepts.","Goertzel will share his thoughts on how to actually pull off this vision at the AI Summit, along with other pioneers trying to hammer out the plumbing, pipes, and protocols of decentralized AI. That brings us to DePIN (or decentralized physical infrastructure networks), where communities of token-holders are incentivized to participate in building online services.","Gensyn, for example, is building a decentralized network that will let the untapped computing power from individual users (like you and me) be harnessed for the training of AI data, a la Filecoin for cloud storage. \u201CWe\u2019re kind of running out of places to build enormous data centers,\u201D Gensyn\u2019s co-founder Ben Fielding told me last year, before this became a trendy topic. If Gensyn pulls this off, says Fielding, \u201CYou don\u2019t just have one big data center. Now you have every data center on the planet.\u201D (Fielding will also be taking the stage at the AI Summit, along with the heads of DePIN projects IoTeX and Grass.)","While many of the Web3+AI projects are infrastructure plays, there are now attempts to build decentralized GenAI models that compete directly with the OpenAIs of the world. And that gets us to another example of the crypto-meets-AI space, Erik Voorhees, a bitcoin OG who has vocally supported Morpheus (decentralized and open-sourced AI) and recently announced the launch of VeniceAI.","In a Twitter\/X thread, Voorhees argued that Venice is similar to centralized chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude and even Grok, but \u201Cwithout all the Orwellian stuff\u201D and that \u201CVenice doesn\u2019t spy on you,\u201D \u201CVenice doesn\u2019t censor your conversation,\u201D and \u201CVenice doesn\u2019t inject bias, safetyism, or political propaganda.\u201D Only 10 days later he showed it in action and said, \u201CThere are no ads in Venice.ai and you get basically the same answer as MSFTCopilot.\u201D Shots fired.","Voorhees and Venice are just some of the players in this space. There are countless more. Every day there\u2019s a new launch or new partnerships. Just in the last few days, for example, Eternal AI announced a partnership with Filecoin, as a Twitter\/X post explained that \u201CFilecoin will provide decentralized storage for AI models, while Eternal AI, with its network of AI agents, will provide decentralized inference.\u201D","One reason these projects are all suddenly so prevalent? To be cynical for a moment, sure, there\u2019s heat in the space and VCs like heat. (The return of a crypto bull market doesn\u2019t hurt.) But another reason is that, in a sense, there are no other options. There aren\u2019t many centralized AI players. The costs are staggering so only a handful can play at the table.","\u201CThe power concentration [of AI] is getting worse, not better,\u201D says Nathaniel Whittemore, aka NLW, host of the AI Daily Brief and founder of BeSuperAI, who\u2019s hosting an AI Town Hall at Consensus. \u201CAnd greater concentration leads to more of a feeling of a need for decentralized approaches.\u201D","None of this will happen overnight. In some ways, it\u2019s all still a longshot. We need the smartest people in the space to collaborate, argue, and swap ideas and inspiration. We need an AI Summit.","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Claude","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Voorhees","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Austin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nathaniel Whittemore","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Panama City","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ben Fielding","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goertzel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Venice","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Filecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ben Goertzel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Big Tech","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"German Research Center","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zuckerberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2001","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Singularity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Erik Voorhees","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AI Town Hall","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Siri","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 31","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Features","Consensus 2024"],"authors":["Jeff Wilser"]}
