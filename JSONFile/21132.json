In the early hours of June 11, the duo went to a \u201Clove motel\u201D in Gyeonggi Province. The man, who is in his 40s and was named by the court as B, had told A about the scale of his crypto holdings during their conversation on the chat app platform.","But the court heard that A then proceeded to lace B\u2019s drink with sleeping pills, before using his phone to transfer tokens from a smartphone-based crypto wallet to her own wallet.","EDaily reported that the smartphone in question was protected with a fingerprint sensor \u2013 but that A was able to press B\u2019s finger against the sensor to unlock the device while he was unconscious.","When B regained consciousness, he confronted A, who then proceeded to threaten him with telling B\u2019s family about the \u201Csordid\u201D nature of their encounter.","B proceeded to report the incident to the police \u2013 but A attempted to confuse the police officers who questioned her by claiming that B had in fact raped her, and had given her the crypto in an attempt to silence her.","The court and presiding judge Hwang In-seong found A guilty of robbery, threatening behavior, and injury, as well as violations of the Drug Management Act. She was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice.","The judge stated that the sentence was justified due to the fact that the amount of crypto holdings stolen was high, and that A had attempted to sow the seeds of confusion in the ensuing police investigation.\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 \u2018Wave of Crypto Muggings\u2019 Hits London\u2019s Financial District\n\u2013 Norwegian Police Warn Crypto Owners After Armed Robbery in Sweden\n\n\u2013 Asian Lonely Hearts Falling Victim to Bitcoin, Tether Scammers\n\u2013 Impostors Make Deep Fake Videos of Ordinary \u2018More Believable\u2019 People to Promote Crypto Scams\n\n\u2013 NFT Self Defense: Staying Safe in Web3\n\u2013 American Entrepreneur Tortured by Gang Trying to Steal His Bitcoin\n\n\u2013 Man \u2018Murdered\u2019 as Crypto Miners\u2019 Bid to Protect Rigs Turns Deadly\n\u2013 Crypto Trader\u2019s Murder Blamed On Social Media Bragging\n\n\u2013 Hong Kong Crypto Robbers Strike Again: Gang Makes off with 450k Tether Haul\n\u2013 Police in Latvia Thwart Brutal Crypto Theft and Murder Plot"],"entity":[{"type":"Suwon District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Latvia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Miners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sweden","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Newsis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gyeonggi Province","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Muggings\u2019 Hits London\u2019s Financial District\n\u2013 Norwegian Police Warn Crypto Owners After Armed Robbery","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"early hours of June 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 10, 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ordinary \u2018More Believable\u2019 People to Promote Crypto Scams\n\n\u2013 NFT Self Defense","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crime","Cryptocurrency","Scam","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
