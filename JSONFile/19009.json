The investor said he expects the world\u2019s leading coin to move within its latest price range, given that lately, there have not been any significant capital injections into the industry.","\u201CWill Bitcoin get through USD 30,000 on this move up? We will see. I\u2019m doubtful. I think we\u2019re going to probably be in this range now. I quite frankly would be happy if we\u2019re in a USD 20,000, USD 22,000, or USD 30,000 range for a while,\u201D Novogratz told Bloomberg, adding:","\u201CWe\u2019re not seeing huge institutional flows, to be fair, but we\u2019re not seeing a back away.\u201D ","At 09:01 UTC, BTC trades at USD 23,838 and is down 1% in a day and up 2% in a week. BTC jumped 10% in a month, trimming its annual losses to less than 46%.","\u201CBitcoin\u2019s story is very much tied to the Fed,\u201D he said of the impact the US Federal Reserve exerts on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, adding that \u201Cassets are going up\u201D and that he thinks the Fed \u201Cwill stop raising [interest] rates.\u201D","\u201CI don\u2019t see the mania that we saw in 2021 or 2017 reigniting,\u201D according to Novogratz, who is skeptical there is a \u201Csoft landing\u201D ahead of the global markets and believes the world is heading toward a recession.","Despite Galaxy Digital posting a USD 554m loss in the second quarter of 2022, Novogratz said he actually decided to purchase more stock in his company. The businessman said that, while the worst for the cryptocurrency industry is over for now in terms of price decreases, he was determined to look at crypto investments \u201Cwithin the three- to four-year horizon, not the three- to four-month horizon.\u201D","Novogratz admitted that, in the early stage of the current crypto market downturn, he considered laying off some of his company\u2019s employees.","\u201CI looked at my business really hard, and my first instinct was: we\u2019ve got to cut a lot,\u201D the entrepreneur said. Yet, after \u201Cwe relitigated every single one of our business lines, we ended up cutting very little and we\u2019re actually going to end the year with probably 25%-30% more employees than we started the year with.\u201D","","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin and Hard Assets Will Win as Inflation Rises, Novogratz Says and Sees BTC at USD 500K\n\u2013 Brace For \u2018Really Volatile\u2019 6-12 Months in Crypto Regulatory Sphere \u2013 Novogratz\n\n\u2013 Majority Expects Bitcoin to Hit USD 10,000 Before Moving Higher \u2013 Survey\n\u2013 Bitcoin Could Fall to USD 13.6K This Year, Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy\u2019s Saylor Says Stepping Down as CEO Will Let Him Focus More on Bitcoin\n\u2013 Analysts Discuss \u2018Inherent Resilience\u2019 in Bitcoin & Crypto as Rally Fades"],"entity":[{"type":"Crypto Regulatory Sphere \u2013 Novogratz\n\n\u2013 Majority Expects Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin & Crypto as Rally Fades","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"second quarter of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"12 Months","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Forecast","Galaxy Digital","Mike Novogratz"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
