There\u2019s already a lot of progress accomplished in this area, \u201Cthe spec there is almost done,\u201D and \u201Cit\u2019s mostly an implementation challenge now,\u201D he claims.","What Ethereum team seems particularly excited about is another scaling research that Buterin says is making progress and is coming soon: Rollups.","Buterin explains in simple terms that a Rollup is a scaling technique that keeps transaction data on-chain, in a compressed form, but the computation is pushed off-chain. Instead of verifying computation, such as signature verification, contract execution, zero-knowledge (ZK) proof execution, etc., directly on-chain, it\u2019s verified either in:","Both of these are \u201Camazing\u201D techniques, Buterin claims, adding that he expects them to make \u201Ca huge difference over the next year or so.\u201D For example, Loopring recently launched a ZK-Rollup exchange, which can theoretically accomplish 2,500 transactions per second (TPS) if all Ethereum users were to become their users. Furthermore, Optimism and Arbitrum are two teams he names as making major progress in the area of Optimistic Rollups. These are not just scaling payments, he says, but are \u201Cscaling something that is equivalent to the Ethereum virtual machine.\u201D","A lot of \u201Cquiet work\u201D has been happening in the past month, he adds, in making zero-knowledge proofs for general computation possible, which will be \u201Cgreat\u201D for any ZK rollup, as well as for the growth of privacy, claims Buterin.","Furthermore, the scaling solutions are expected to lead to a variety of benefits. On a public chain, one can do a maximum of 15 TPS, says Buterin, a Rollup brings that up to 2,500-3,000 TPS, with sharding it\u2019s 2,000-10,000 TPS, and it\u2019s even higher with a Rollup on top of sharding. \u201CScalability of doing things on public blockchains is going to be very soon good enough for many kinds of mainstream enterprise applications,\u201D and \u201Cit\u2019ll lead to the change of focus for a lot of people.\u201D","As for the longer-term plans, Buterin says that the work on Ethereum 2.0 will be ongoing this year and likely the next two years or so, but that we should expect Phase 0 to launch \u201Cat some point in the summer.\u201D This phase will launch the Beacon Chain, an independent proof-of-stake chain. It\u2019s currently in the \u201Cvery late\u201D stage of development and has already undergone a lot of testing. \u201CThat\u2019s something we\u2019re very excited about,\u201D says Buterin. \u201CProof-of-stake is finally going to be real.\u201D This phase will be followed by Phase 1 that\u2019ll bring sharding of data.","Meanwhile, many others have been trying to find the solution to this blockchain issue, such as those by Asensys and MIT we recently talked about.","ETH is currently (09:49 UTC) trading at USD 236, having appreciated 2% in 24 hours and 7% in seven days.","{no_ads}"],"entity":[{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Rollup","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Ethereum","Scalability","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
