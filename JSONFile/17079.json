Seoul has thus far refused to budge on its hardline stance on ICOs, play-to-earn games, and NFT regulation.","However, it appears politicians are now ready to make a fresh bid for change in Jeju.","The Jeju Island Governor Oh Young-hoon told attendees at an IT-related forum this week:","\u201CThis year, we are gradually making preparations to focus on digital transformation.

Kwon Soo-ho, the head of the Korea Blockchain Industry Promotion Association\u2019s educational operations, also claimed that blockchain technology and NFTs could be used throughout Jeju.","Executives from the Jeju Research Institute, Jeju Creative Economy Innovation Center, and \u201Cother related organizations\u201D also attended the event.","Kwon said that NFT-related innovations could be \u201Capplied to various fields\u201D in Jeju, including payments and traceability in the agricultural and \u201Clivestock products\u201D industries.","Attendees also suggested using NFTs for hikers and walkers on the Jeju Olle Trail, a 437 km network of footpaths on the island\u2019s coastline.","The trail is a major draw for foreign and domestic tourists. Speakers suggested awarding discount-bestowing NFTs to visitors who complete certain sections of the trail.","Other speakers suggested that NFTs could be used to promote sales and subsidies in the agriculture and fisheries sectors.","They also said that officials could use NFTs to help Jeju producers prove the authenticity of their goods and foodstuff.","Hana Bank offers mobile financial certificates in 16 languageshttps:\/\/t.co\/1J4fhGPTg0","\u2014 The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) March 4, 2024","","Jeju is famous for delicacies including pork products from Jeju Black pigs.
