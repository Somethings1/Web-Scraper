Among other things, the letter called for the DCG board to sack Barry Silbert as the company\u2019s CEO.","\u201CLike Gemini, we share the confidence that a solution can be found to the satisfaction of all concerned,\u201D Bitvavo wrote in reference to the letter, which has been published on Twitter by Gemini\u2019s co-founder Cameron Winklevoss.","","Earn Update: An Open Letter to the Board of @DCGco pic.twitter.com\/eakuFjDZR2","Bitvavo added in its update that it believes payment of the outstanding amount owed by DCG can still be made even if DCG subsidiary Genesis Global files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.","A bankruptcy has been suggested as a possibility by major media outlets like the Wall Street Journal, given the solvency issues experienced by the crypto lender. In November, Genesis had some $2.8bn in outstanding loans on its balance sheet.","Gemini relied on Genesis for its \u201CEarn\u201D program, and withdrawals from the program became impossible after Genesis closed redemptions for its clients back in November last year.","The Dutch crypto exchange further assured its clients that the process surrounding DCG and Genesis will have no impact on them.","\u201C[\u2026] the current situation regarding DCG does not impact Bitvavo\u2019s customers, its platform and its services. Bitvavo has guaranteed the outstanding amount and thus assumed the risk on behalf of its customers,\u201D it wrote."],"entity":[{"type":"Bitvavo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitvavo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gemini\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$303m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.8","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cameron Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Gemini"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
