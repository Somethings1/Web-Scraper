The full design is in process with a leading global semiconductor foundry, according to the post.","In addition to that, Block said that after speaking to community members about the pain points in the industry, it decided to also develop a full bitcoin mining system, which will include system design.","\u201CWe\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time talking to a wide variety of bitcoin miners to identify the challenges faced by mining operators,\u201D it said in the post. \u201CBuilding on these insights and pursuant to our goal of supporting mining decentralization, we plan to offer both a standalone mining chip as well as a full mining system of our own design.","The bitcoin mining industry is dominated by only a few players, with Beijing-based miner Bitmain controlling roughly 60% of the market, according to estimates by CoinShares.","\u201CThere are few serious competitors, which indicates significant potential for disruption,\u201D said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.","Block announced the completion of a five-nanometer bitcoin mining chip prototype in May 2023, which is the same technology that Bitmain\u2019s S21 mining machine uses. \u201CThis leads us to believe that 3nm chips could achieve even greater efficiencies,\u201D he said.","Although chip efficiency has rapidly improved in recent years as demand for bitcoin has picked up, the latest halving event on April 20, which cut the issuance of new bitcoin by 50%, adds even more importance for faster mining speed, as well as lower costs and enhances reliability, Butterfill said.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Beijing","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Square","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"James Butterfill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Block","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Butterfill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinShares","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Dorsey\u2019s Block (SQ)","Jack Dorsey","Bitcoin","Bitcoin Mining"],"authors":["Helene Braun"]}
