The network infrastructure is now fully\u2026","\u2014 SHADID | $IOâ„¢ (@shadid_io) April 28, 2024","","The attackers had exploited a vulnerability that allowed them to mimic the signals sent by genuine GPUs, thus fooling the network into recognizing them as legitimate.","\u201CLike many startups, we move fast, and sometimes we break things,\u201D stated Shadid. \u201CIn this case, something broke, and someone or some group sought to exploit that.\u201D","Shadid noted that following the launch of their fundraising and incentives program in March, Io.net saw an exponential increase in GPU connections. Initially, these appeared normal with stable clustering and valid heartbeats.","However, the rapid growth overwhelmed their infrastructure, leaving the team unprepared and unable to detect underlying vulnerabilities.","\u201CThis attack was a painful lesson for me,\u201D said the CEO. \u201CI apologize to the community for allowing it to happen. Much of the criticism we\u2019ve received is reasonable and our team takes it in stride.\u201D","The company is actively implementing a series of measures to strengthen network security and restore confidence.","Firstly, Io.net is enhancing the clarity and transparency of its user interface. The network now displays three key metrics on its dashboard: total GPUs\/CPUs connected, verified GPUs\/CPUs that have passed the Proof of Work process, etc.","The technology team is also committed to transparency and will soon publish a list of known issues to keep the public informed, including ongoing bugs and necessary updates.","Lastly, the business team is coordinating a network reboot, which prioritizes strengthening supplier relationships and quickly restoring the network\u2019s operational capacity."],"entity":[{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 27","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$IO","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"IO Nation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shadid","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"GPU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 28, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ahmad Shadid","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Cybersecurity","Hack","Solana"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
