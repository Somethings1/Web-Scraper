Worthington predicts a more challenging year for the cryptocurrency exchange in 2024.","Worthington acknowledges Coinbase\u2019s progress in various initiatives, such as the development of derivatives and the Layer-2 Base, but still anticipates difficulties ahead.","JPMorgan analysts value Coinbase stock at $80 per share based on normalized earnings power, suggesting a downside of 35% for the shares.","Coinbase has been actively expanding its global presence.","Back in September, the exchange revealed that it secured an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance registration from the Bank of Spain, making it a registered crypto exchange in the country.","The registration with the Bank of Spain allows Coinbase to offer its full suite of products and services to both retail and institutional users in Spain while ensuring compliance with the country\u2019s legal framework.","Over the past year, Coinbase has obtained Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registrations in several European countries, including Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands.","It has also received in-principle approval and launched its services in Singapore, Brazil, and Canada.","The company\u2019s push for global expansion comes amid growing regulatory hostility in the US.","Back in June, the SEC sued Coinbase for selling unregistered securities and a number of other alleged wrongdoings.","However, despite Coinbase\u2019s efforts to expand its services, such as launching an international exchange for crypto derivatives to attract non-US institutional investors and introducing Base, a layer-2 blockchain designed to scale the user base, JPMorgan analysts remain cautious about the company\u2019s future performance."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VASP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Virtual Asset Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kenneth B.
