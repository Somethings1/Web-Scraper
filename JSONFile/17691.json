This sharp growth boosted the market capitalization of the asset above $28 billion.","At press time, the total market cap of the asset stands at $28.5 billion with trading volumes of $8.6 billion, a 144% increase in the last 24 hours.","The narrative around USDC is shifting slightly after it dropped in the first three quarters of 2023 before finding its feet in the last quarter.","These events were linked to the asset losing its dollar peg following revelations of a $3.3 billion exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March.","USDC slumped as low as 87 cents with about 8% of its reserve in SVB before regaining its dollar peg.
