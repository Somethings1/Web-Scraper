Until 2023, there was no way to mint tokens on Bitcoin\u2019s main blockchain, locking it away from many applications available on other chains, including NFTs, stablecoins, and DeFi.","That changed in early 2023 with the rise of Ordinals, as invented by Casey Rordamor. The protocol lets users inscribe individual satoshis with unique identification numbers, and embed them with arbitrary data, enabling NFTs.","Bitcoin NFTs stood out from Ethereum and Solana NFTs, in that their image data was embedded directly into Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, rather than on a centralized server.","As of today, Bitcoin hosts a larger NFT market than both blockchains, according to Cryptoslam. In the past 30 days, its processed $462 million in NFT trading volume, versus Ethereum\u2019s $296 million.","A developer named Domo later built on the Ordinals protocol to enable BRC-20 tokens, though the creator himself admitted that such tokens were highly inefficient.","Today, Runes \u2013 once again created by Rordamor \u2013 are designed to be much more efficient, requiring less blockchain-based data to move around than BRC-20 tokens, or even Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens. Some other benefits of Runes include compatibility with the lightning network, and increased transaction privacy.","\u201CBitcoin is positioned well to close the gap between its fungible market cap versus that of other blockchain,\u201D wrote Franklin.","Bitcoin\u2019s total market cap right now is $1.2 trillion, while its fungible token cap is just $600 million. By contrast, Ethereum\u2019s market cap is $378 billion, while its fungible token market cap is $499 billion.","\u201CWe are excited to see if Runes can do for Bitcoin\u2019s Fungible token and DeFi market what Ordinals did for Bitcoin\u2019s Non-fungible token market,\u201D the report concluded."],"entity":[{"type":"April 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.2 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Casey Rordamor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$296 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Twitter","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fungible Token Standard pic.twitter.com\/0VmlFbyKPc","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$600 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Franklin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$499 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$462 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$378 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BRC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana NFTs","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ethereum"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
