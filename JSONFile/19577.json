Money Transmitters Act.","Earlier this year, Storm sought support from right-to-privacy advocates in anticipation of his upcoming criminal trial.","At the time, Storm said that his legal team was preparing a strong defense for his September 2024 trial. ","\u201CWhether you\u2019re [a] passionate developer like me involved with Web3 or just care about software and privacy, this legal battle will affect you. This case will set a major precedent for years to come,\u201D he said. ","In response, the Arbitrum DAO submitted a proposal that called for the allocation of approximately $1.3 million worth of Arbitrum (ARB) tokens from the community wallet to assist Storm.","However, the submitter has since removed the proposal without providing any reasons.","A crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe, intended to collect legal fees for Storm and Pertsev, was canceled on February 16 due to a breach of the platform\u2019s terms of service that could expose GoFundMe, its employees, or users to potential harm or liability.","As reported, the US Treasury has added Tornado Cash to its Specially Designated Nationals list, effectively banning Americans from using this mixer. "],"entity":[{"type":"US Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 16","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"New Jersey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"D.C.
