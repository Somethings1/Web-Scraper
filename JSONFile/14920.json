Hot storage is an app or platform that is connected to the internet, while cold storage is stored offline, often through a physical device such as a thumb drive. While both hot and cold storage systems offer individuals access to their digital funds, they differ in user experience and security levels.","Which option is right for you is a matter of personal choice.
