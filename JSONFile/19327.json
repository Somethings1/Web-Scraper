USD 31 and traders are decidedly bullish, as the price is up by 3% in a day and 13% in a week, trimming its monthly losses to 15%. The coin, ranked 33rd by market capitalization, has an upper hand against the USD, BTC and ETH adding 14% on average in the last trading week. ZEC is also up by 4.5% against BTC, and by almost by 4% against ETH in the past 24 hours.","ZEC has nonetheless been struggling in recent months.
