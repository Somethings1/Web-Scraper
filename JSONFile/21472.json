Chris Dixon, a partner at the VC powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, has predicted that NFTs will \u201Conboard hundreds of millions of new users into crypto\u201D \u2013 emphasis on the new.","Forget crypto arbitrage and complicated decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols; much of that dry, explicitly financial stuff remains niche, even now. NFTs are plastered all over major cities; they make appearances on late night talk shows; they inspire bacchanalian conferences; they\u2019ve infiltrated iconic businesses; they even made it to the Super Bowl.","This article is part of CoinDesk\u2019s Tax Week","But for all the talk about NFTs, and for all the traders now sitting on a mountain of new tokens, there\u2019s been relatively little discussion about how to stay compliant with relevant tax laws.","The lack of information around tax compliance is a problem unique to crypto. Traditional brokerages need to know a little about their customers so they can send out tax forms each year. Anyone who used Robinhood last year during the Gamestop short squeeze can attest: No gain is small enough to escape the IRS. I lost $40 on Gamestop stock last winter; Robinhood still sent me a 1099.","Read More: 5 Things to Remember When Paying Your NFT Taxes","Blockchain-based services like DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces are mostly peer-to-peer, which means they don\u2019t need to collect the same level of information. Part of the novelty of crypto is that it has traditionally rejected know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements (some users tend to think of it as unnecessary financial surveillance), at least on the level of trades within crypto.","A digital wallet application like MetaMask or Rainbow can\u2019t keep track of who\u2019s using it, since it doesn\u2019t actually know anything about its users beyond their public addresses.","It\u2019s usually only when you cash out, from crypto to fiat currency, that you\u2019re once again at the mercy of those pesky KYC-AML requirements. Contrary to popular opinion, crypto is actually terrible at laundering money. Mixing systems like Tornado Cash and Wasabi Wallet can help obfuscate the digital trail (and even they aren\u2019t bulletproof), but at some point, you\u2019re probably going to have to fork over some personal information. There are precious few truly anonymous fiat offramps in 2022. (Though if you want to give it a shot, there are still a few Austrian crypto ATMs that allow for non-KYC\u2019d withdrawal directly into cash.)","So while Coinbase might send you a 1099, MetaMask and Rainbow will not. The same goes for decentralized applications and permissionless NFT marketplaces like Zora. OpenSea, though very much a centralized company, doesn\u2019t ask for personal information, and so won\u2019t send you a 1099.","Lucky for users \u2013 and for accountants in the burgeoning crypto tax industry \u2013 blockchains keep great records.","Shehan Chandrasekera, who heads up strategy at the crypto tax software company CoinTracker, explained that each NFT transaction involves multiple moving parts. Effectively, there may be three taxable events at the same time.","\u201CTypically, you have the transaction \u2013 there's gas fees associated with that \u2013 and you're [converting] these NFTs to another type of cryptocurrency, mainly Ethereum: that also triggers a taxable event,\u201D he said. \u201CThere could be royalties associated with that, and that triggers a taxable event.\u201D","So you\u2019re incurring at least a few taxable events with your average NFT transaction. After the purchase of the NFT, you\u2019re paying taxes again on the sale of the NFT into liquid crypto, and again on the conversion of those gains back into fiat money.","Read More: The 7 Types of Crypto Tax Nightmares","There\u2019s also the question of how to value illiquid gains in the form of NFTs you haven\u2019t sold; unrealized gains aren\u2019t taxed, but if you\u2019re looking to donate an NFT, or pass it on after your death, you\u2019ll need to get a handle on how much it\u2019s worth (estate taxes still apply). Most NFTs in a given collection will sell around the \u201Cfloor price,\u201D or the lowest amount any token in a collection is currently listed for sale. But what about NFTs with especially rare traits? Who\u2019s to say how much they\u2019re worth, without a proper valuation?","\u201CThe hard part of NFTs is not really the taxable side of it, it\u2019s the fair market value of what that NFT is worth,\u201D said Dan Hannum, chief operating officer at CoinTracker competitor ZenLedger \u2013 that is, the reasonable price for an asset on the open market. \u201CIf you have NFT \u2018ABC,\u2019 and I give you a 100 ETH offer, and you don't accept it, does that mean it's now worth 100 ETH? You didn't accept it, so the hard part is tracking how much your NFT is currently worth.\u201D","In the real estate world, official appraisers in the U.S. need a special designation \u2013 M.A.I., meaning \u201Cmember of the Appraisal Institute\u201D \u2013 before they can value a piece of property. A professional NFT appraiser might serve a similar function in crypto. (How else to divide up digital property, in the case of a divorce?)","Hannum added that \u201Cloot box\u201D-style NFTs (NFTs that can be used to mint other NFTs, potentially with their own discrete values) add yet another tax wrinkle. And it\u2019s reasonable to expect things will only continue to get more complicated over time, since developers are experimenting with new models for multi-stage NFT drops every day.","It\u2019s daunting for traders, but also for accountants from the traditional tax world.","Tiffany Liu, a CPA who\u2019s historically specialized in real estate taxes, has been handling all her boyfriend\u2019s crypto taxes for the past couple of years. This year, she\u2019s adding NFTs to her own tax treatment.","\u201CIt's kind of chaotic,\u201D she said. \u201CBut essentially, [crypto taxes] are all based on existing frameworks. And very standard frameworks, like selling property. That's how I've been able to apply my experience.\u201D","And though these things have a tendency to get very complicated very quickly, Liu maintained that she\u2019s enjoying the chaos. She characterized it as a kind of group-learning experience.","\u201CPrior to this, I'm like, \u2018Oh, I have a boring job, I do tax compliance,\u2019\u201D she said. \u201CTo me, real estate was the most exciting industry. But now with this coming into play, it's a lot more people who maybe previously didn't have that many tax implications \u2013 all of a sudden, there's really significant tax implications, especially with the movement of ETH and all these crazy coins. I wish I could help everybody, because these are real consequences.\u201D","The number of new recruits entering the NFT market has been a boon for crypto tax software companies (Chandrasekera said CoinTracker is already seeing an uptick in customers looking for help with NFT taxes, specifically), but there\u2019s been relatively little tax-related messaging from NFT companies themselves.","Again, OpenSea and its competitors don\u2019t have to help you out \u2013 but that\u2019s not to say they\u2019re not making an effort. CoinTracker recently announced a partnership with OpenSea, offering free tax reports for up to 50 transactions.","Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022","Chandrasekera says the responsible thing for these companies to do would be to distribute tax guidance the way platforms sometimes distribute free tokens to encourage adoption.","\u201CThey should airdrop a discounted tax plan to every wallet connected to these protocols,\u201D he suggested. \u201CThat's the way for to [say], \u2018hey, we know we created some taxable events for you, here's a tool for you to figure it out.\u2019\u201D","I asked Liu whether she thought \u2013 given all the activity around NFTs this past year, and the massive push to frame crypto collectibles as an on-ramp to a new decentralized internet, or Web 3 \u2013 the average newcomer might be prone to slip up on their taxes this year, shackled with tax obligations they didn\u2019t know they had.","\u201CI think there is some leeway,\u201D she said, \u201Csome grace room for the fact that you tried your best. I feel like the IRS, and the government in general, is so crazy backed up \u2013 it's a mess. And at the end of the day, they're always going to go for the top players first.\u201D","Which is to say, the IRS is going to be watching the whales, the traders with Bored Apes and Chromie Squiggles and millions of dollars on the line. Newcomers probably aren\u2019t going to jail over a few miscalculated or misreported transactions.","Still, Liu acknowledged that it\u2019s a confusing new world, even for tax professionals like her.","\u201CWe're all in this together,\u201D she said.","Crypto won\u2019t save you from taxes, but it may eventually make them easier to pay, says futurist Dan Jeffries.","Tax guidance lags innovation. So does tax software. Meanwhile, misconceptions abound. If not careful, investors can end up owing more tax than expected and having to unload crypto to pay the bill.","Investors in MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block and Coinbase need to consider how wild price swings will affect results, not only directly but indirectly due to complex tax accounting rules."],"entity":[{"type":"CoinTracker","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dan Jeffries","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chandrasekera","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gamestop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rainbow","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"late night","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Andreessen Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Liu","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tiffany Liu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$40","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1099","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Robinhood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shehan Chandrasekera","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ABC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Appraisal Institute\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chris Dixon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chromie Squiggles","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"IRS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"winter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dan Hannum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"OpenSea","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"You May Owe Crypto Taxes","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Remember When Paying Your NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Tax Nightmares","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hannum","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["tax week","NFTs"],"authors":["Will Gottsegen"]}
