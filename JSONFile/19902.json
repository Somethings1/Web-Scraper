A plant in the Khanty-Mansi region has been modified to run hundreds of mining rigs in parallel to oil pumps, while the head of a major Russian gas industry group has talked of crypto mining as a \u201Cway to monetize cheap electricity where there is a surplus, or where the cost of electricity production is higher than market prices.\u201D","Big industrial players have urged Moscow to legalize their industry, even if doing so would land them tax bills and higher electricity tariffs. And the Ministry of Finance is exceptionally keen to do so \u2013 believing the additional tax revenue could provide a much-needed boost to Treasury coffers. The ministry will be hopeful of pushing through the required legislation when lawmakers return to the State Duma for a new session at the end of this month.","Timofey Semyonov, Intellon\u2019s General Director, was quoted as stating that a \u201Cgrowing interest in energy-intensive blockchain computing \u2013 against the backdrop of a significant surplus of energy resources in a number of Russian regions\u201D was \u201Cundoubtedly\u201D providing \u201Cnew opportunities.\u201D","Semyonov claimed that not only were miners set to benefit from the industry\u2019s development but that \u201Ca significant number of related industries\u201D also stood to benefit.","Per the University of Cambridge\u2019s Judge Business School\u2019s calculations, Russia accounted for 4.66% of the average global monthly BTC hashrate in January this year \u2013 although some argue that Russia\u2019s mining capacity may have grown rapidly in recent months as a result of China\u2019s September 2021 crackdown on mining.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Gathers Support in Russia as More Details Emerge on International Crypto Payments\n\u2013 Russia: Only Industrial Players May Be Allowed to Mine Bitcoin & Crypto\n\n\u2013 Time to Legalize and Tax Bitcoin Mining in Russia, Say Deputy PM, Academic & Think Tank\n\u2013 Moscow Exchange Should Launch a Crypto Trading Platform, Says Top Russian Politician\n\n\u2013 Here\u2019s Why Russia Has Issued a New \u2018Crypto Payments Ban\u2019\n\u2013 Russian Banks to \u2018Start Handling Digital Ruble by 2024\u2019"],"entity":[{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Khanty","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Intelion Data Systems","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mine Bitcoin & Crypto\n\n\u2013 Time","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State Duma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Gathers Support","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"150%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Moscow","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mansi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Timofey Semyonov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the Ministry of Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"end of this month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gazprom Neft","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2018Start Handling Digital Ruble","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"45%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"the University of Cambridge\u2019s Judge Business School","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Intellon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tax Bitcoin Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"4.66%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Novie Izvetiya","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"More Details Emerge on International Crypto Payments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Academic & Think Tank\n\u2013 Moscow Exchange Should Launch","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Bitcoin","Mining","Regulation","Russia","Tax"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
