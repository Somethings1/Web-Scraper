You can only use it to do 2 things: Spend It or HODL It. Both are easy to understand.\u201D He also touted the advantages of DOGE as a fun community that is easy to get into.","Yet, when asked about his personal investment portfolio and whether he owns more DOGE or bitcoin (BTC), he replied, \u201CThe Mavs have what we sold in merch. I personally own USD 494 worth of DOGE.\u201D","At the time of writing, this amount of USD Cuban mentioned would be equal to some 1,440 coins.","The response was overwhelmingly negative: many asked why he wouldn\u2019t \u201Cpractice what [he preached]\u201D, as many in the community have invested in the asset directly because of his endorsements.","This did not affect the price of DOGE negatively, as the coin was the second-best performer among the top 10 coins by market capitalization today (at 13:30 UTC), going up 13.5%. It is trading at around USD 0.34. Overall, it\u2019s up 40% in a week, and 90% in a month.","The coin reached its all-time high in May 2021, at USD 0.73 according to data aggregator CoinGecko, largely thanks to Cuban\u2019s fellow billionaire Elon Musk.","Cuban, on the other hand, has previously stated that 60% of his crypto portfolio is in BTC, 30% in ethereum (ETH), and the remaining 10% belongs to other, unspecified crypto assets. In other words, his latest DOGE holdings reveal might not be that surprising.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Mark Cuban Praises Ethereum and Keeps Buying Bitcoin\n\u2013 Mark Cuban Says He\u2019s \u2018All-in\u2019 on Ethereum and Bitcoin","\u2013 \u2018Crypto Bank Run\u2019 Shows Mark Cuban That DYOR Comes Before Regulation\n\u2013 Cuban & Musk Turn up the DOGE Again \u2013 Critics Ring Warning Bells (Again)","\u2013 Mark Cuban May Be More Involved with Crypto, \u2018Shitcoins\u2019 than First Thought\n\u2013 Mark Cuban Says Crypto Is a Store of Value & Redditors Right to \u2018Kick Wall St. Ass"],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crypto Bank Run\u2019 Shows Mark Cuban That DYOR Comes Before Regulation\n\u2013 Cuban & Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dallas Mavericks","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"13.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Thought\n\u2013 Mark Cuban Says Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mark Cuban","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Store of Value & Redditors Right to \u2018Kick Wall St. Ass","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Altcoins","Bitcoin","Dogecoin","Ethereum","Market"],"authors":["Sumejja Muratagić-Tadić"]}
