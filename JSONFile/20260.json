The issuers would have until Monday morning to submit their final revisions.","To initiate the trading of a spot Bitcoin ETF, the SEC must first approve the 19b-4 filings provided by the exchanges planning to list these ETFs. Subsequently, the regulator must also approve the S-1 registration applications prior to the launch.","As the SEC is expected to decide on both the 19b-4 and S-1 filings, the Bitcoin ETFs can be listed and start trading on exchanges as soon as the next business day once approved, hypothetically Jan. 11. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the SEC has never voted on the decision.","\u201CThe SEC has never voted on bitcoin ETFs (spot denials or the futures approvals),\u201D said Balchunas in a social media post. the applications \u201Cwere denied or approved via \u2018Delegated Authority\u2019 \u2026 which would make sense here too since this has been a \u201810th floor\u2019 driven initiative since the Grayscale win.\u201D","Re the \"but the SEC hasn't voted\" and how that's some kind of poss rug pull. Few things, the SEC has never voted on bitcoin ETFs (spot denials or the futures approvals), they were denied or approved via \"Delegated Authority\" (see below from commish Peirce speech) which would make\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/X8pzQchexj","\u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 6, 2024","","Even if there were a vote, it is unlikely for the SEC Chair Gary Gensler to vote no for two reasons, \u201Ca) there\u2019s no basis to deny,\u201D said Balchunas. \u201CAnd b) he is literally the one who directed the Staff to put in thousands of man hours to work w 11 issuers on 5-10 rounds of comments.\u201D","The ETF Store President Nate Geraci shared what he will be watching this week regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs. And the first thing that came in mind is the pending disclosure of the unrevealed fees.","\u201CEspecially from BlackRock & Grayscale. Can\u2019t overstate importance of fees in this competition,\u201D said Geraci, \u201CFidelity current leader at 0.39%. Invesco at 0.59% (though waiving fee for first 6mos).\u201D","Balchunas also reinstated that when one invests in a spot Bitcoin ETF, they do own the Bitcoin that has been deposited with the designated custodian.","\u201CIt is true when you sell you can\u2019t get btc back but no one who would use an ETF wants btc back- they\u2019d rather have USD,\u201D said Balchunas in another post. \u201CFor the true believers who want to own btc directly, you SHOULD.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan. 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nate Geraci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Geraci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"4","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0.59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Eric Balchunas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\"Delegated Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock & Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Balchunas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u2018Delegated Authority\u2019","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Blackrock","SEC"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
