If cryptocurrencies get support from the global risk appetite on Friday, Bitcoin could exceed $70K over the weekend,\u201D shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk, referring to increased inflows from spot ETFs.","\u201CA test of the $71K-$74K highs area, in our view, could happen as early as early next week, triggering a new episode of FOMO,\u201D Kuptsikevich.","Singapore-based QCP Capital gave out similar price targets in a client note earlier this week.","Such bullish outlooks come as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset have logged four straight days of inflows, ending Thursday at $257 million in net inflows. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks \u2013 with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows on some days.","BlackRock\u2019s IBIT received $94 million in inflows on Thursday, the largest among peers. GrayScale\u2019s GBTC, which has mostly seen outflows since its January listing, received over $4.6 million in inflows.","Earlier this week, multiple regulatory filings showed that several big-name funds, such as Millennium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.","The softer-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggered a break out of the range for BTC on Wednesday. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.","Edited by Oliver Knight."],"entity":[{"type":"Millennium Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Oliver Knight","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"0.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Alex Kuptsikevich","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$71K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$65K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$94 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$74,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"0.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$257 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"$4.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Elliot Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$70K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$66K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$74K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$66,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Trading","btc","Market"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
