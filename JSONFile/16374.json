And then hang it on the wall or put it on display as a symbol of monetary \u2013 and legal \u2013 incompetence.","Proposed by Democrat members of Congress as a solution to the U.S. debt ceiling impasse, the idea behind the coin is deceptively simple: There\u2019s a loophole in the U.S. law allowing the Treasury Department to keep spending even after the limit on how much public debt can be incurred \u2013 the debt ceiling \u2013 has been reached.","The ploy is to use a rule that authorizes Treasury to issue a platinum coin \u201Cin accordance with such specifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions as the Secretary, in the Secretary\u2019s discretion, may prescribe from time to time.\u201D","So, yes, it\u2019s perfectly legal for the Secretary of the Treasury to wake up one day feeling bold and instruct the U.S. Mint to create a trillion-dollar platinum coin. The debt ceiling wouldn\u2019t be raised \u2013 only Congress can do that. Still, minting a coin is different from issuing debt, like government bonds, so the public debt wouldn\u2019t immediately grow. Problem solved, right?","Wrong. Minting the coin is the easy part. Spending the damn coin, on the other hand, is all but impossible. Platinum coins are numismatic coins. They were first introduced in 1996 by Pub. L. 104\u2013208, which authorized the Treasury Dept. to issue them, and, in 2000, Pub. L. 106\u2013445 made their numismatic nature clear (image below).","Unlike regular coins, such as pennies, dimes or quarters, numismatic coins aren\u2019t put in circulation through the Federal Reserve Banks. Instead, they\u2019re sold to collectors either directly by the U.S. Mint or through authorized dealers. More than that, as these coins are made of precious metals and intended for collection and investment, they are usually sold for a price much higher than their face value.","The platinum coins available at the U.S. Mint, for example, have a face value of $100 but are sold for $1,545 each. So, the question is: To whom will Treasury sell the coin in order to receive in payment \u201Creal\u201D money that could then be spent as if there were no tomorrow?","Sure, the U.S. Mint could advertise the trillion-dollar platinum coin on its website, and maybe Warren Buffett would be willing to invest $1,000,000,000,001 in this historic coin to save the U.S. government from default.","Read More: Moving on From Good-Bad Crypto Dialogue | Marcelo Prates","If Buffett doesn\u2019t come to the rescue, things get more complicated. Proponents of the trillion-dollar coin adamantly treat this as a non-issue because they believe the Federal Reserve would have no problem in purchasing the coin and replenishing the Treasury Dept.\u2019s account with dollars that could be immediately spent.","What they ignore is that the Fed doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to buy anything directly from Treasury, much less numismatic coins. The only thing issued by Treasury that the U.S. central bank can legally buy is government bonds and, even so, in the open market (Section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act).","\u201CIn the open market\u201D means that, if the Fed needs to buy or sell government securities to implement monetary policy, it has to do it in the secondary market instead of transacting directly with the Treasury Dept. As a result, the Fed only buys government securities from financial institutions, never from Treasury.","This rule exists to prevent the Fed from issuing money to finance government spending. Monetary financing, as this expedient is known, has been prohibited in most jurisdictions since the 1930s to prevent politicians from using the monetary power of central banks with little regard for fiscal responsibility or price stability.","Well, but couldn\u2019t the Treasury Dept. simply deposit the trillion-dollar coin in its Fed account (Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act) to increase the available balance? No, because Fed accounts only receive reserves, a type of money used for payments inside the banking system and in transactions between the banks and the Fed or Treasury.","And even if the Fed received the coin in deposit to keep it in one of its safes, the Fed would be acting like a vault only, returning the coin whenever the Treasury Dept. asked for it \u2013 perhaps the day a filthy rich patriot agreed to purchase this exquisite collector\u2019s piece.","The trillion-dollar coin isn\u2019t just a cute but faulty idea, it\u2019s useless.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"$1,545","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Reserve Banks","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Treasury Dept.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bad Crypto Dialogue","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2000","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1930s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1996","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Treasury Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marcelo Prates","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1,000,000,000,001","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Buffett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Warren Buffett","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Congress","Debt","Opinion","Federal Reserve","Treasury Department"],"authors":["Marcelo Prates"]}
