And we must understand that their activities are organized primarily by the intelligence services. [\u2026] They are not so idiotic that they would transfer money from an account in Geneva to Moscow. [\u2026] Cryptocurrency is now the only way to refill their wallets.\u201D","Lugovoy repeated previous criticism about the government\u2019s apparent inability to launch crypto regulation.","Such legislation, he said, could prevent spies and \u201Cforeign agents\u201D from accessing crypto. He explained:","\u201CTwo years ago, on the initiative of our chairman, we created a [crypto regulation] working group. And what has happened since then?\u201D","Earlier this month, Lugovoy called Russian crypto policy \u201Cbad to disgusting.\u201D He chastised the government\u2019s failure to create crypto regulation, and said:","\u201CThe lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency sector in Russia plays into the hands of [the West\u2019s] sanctions policy against our country. It is undermining the anti-sanctions policies of the Russian government.\u201D","In his earlier speech, he also hit out at the crypto working groups established in a bid to break through an impasse between top ministries, law enforcement agencies, and the crypto-skeptic Central Bank.","A Russian-Swedish national ran a crypto mixing service that served as a critical link in helping move tens of millions of dollars from darknet markets, a prosecutor alleged https:\/\/t.co\/Q86xlGr1uW","\u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) February 15, 2024","","Lugavoy called for Russian authorities to identify \u201Cforeign agents and their relatives\u201D and force them to \u201Creport annually on their income and expenses.\u201D","The lawmaker said that many \u201Cforeign agents\u201D in Russia have \u201Capartments and dachas [countyside holiday homes].\u201D","Lugovoy claimed these individuals \u201Cact under the direction of foreign intelligence services and embassies.\u201D","He concluded that \u201Cforeign agents\u201D are still allowed to move around Russia \u201Cunchecked.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Lugovoy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Geneva","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US State Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"British Foreign Ministry","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"tens of millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma\u2019s Committee on Security","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moscow","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Andrei Lugovoy","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Politics","Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
