The beleaguered company already had disputes with the US securities regulator, which closed with $2.8 million payment in April, 2023.","Per a press release on Wednesday, Hampton and his co-conspirators perpetrated securities price manipulation and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.","\u201CHe is scheduled to be sentenced on April 29 and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for the conspiracy to commit securities price manipulation conviction and 20 years in prison for the conspiracy to commit wire fraud conviction.\u201D","Hampton automated trading \u2018bot\u2019 using a 3rd-party firm, that manipulated the token\u2019s price on a US-based crypto exchange. The Hydro crypto flooded the market with fake orders from October 2018 to April 2019, the release noted.","The convicts used the bot to execute $7 million in \u201Cwash trades\u201D and $300 million in \u201Cspoof trades\u201D for Hydro.
