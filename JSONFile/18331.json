Now worth $5.4 billion, these excess reserves fully cover Tether\u2019s outstanding secured loans worth $4.8 billion.","Tether Q4\/2023 attestation is out.","My summary:","\u2013 profit for the quarter: $2.85B, of which ~$1B in net operational profit (mainly US t-bill interests), ~$1.85B from gold and #bitcoin holdings.","\u2013 total profit for 2023: $6.2B.","\u2013 cash & cash equivalents cover now 90% of all\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/AXjDw33QTc","\u2014 Paolo Ardoino üçê (@paoloardoino) January 31, 2024","","Such reserves were widely criticized in the past for adding risk to Tether\u2019s portfolio should they not be repaid. As the largest stablecoin issuer, Tether must ensure that its stablecoins remain backed 1:1 by US dollars at all times for the token to retain its value \u2013 or risk an industry-wide financial wipeout.","The bulk of Tether\u2019s portfolio features $82.06 billion of \u201Ccash and cash equivalents,\u201D including $80.3 billion worth of US Treasuries.","It also bears the fruit of more recent investments, including $3.6 billion in gold, and another $2.1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC), alongside $5.6 billion of \u201Cother\u201D holdings.","Tether has also invested $1.5 billion into VC investments in areas like AI infrastructure, Bitcoin mining, and P2P telecommunications technology. These assets aren\u2019t considered part of the reserves backing its tokens.","Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino said:","\u201CThe substantial net profits generated not only in the last quarter of the year but throughout the year, amounting to $6.2 billion, showcases our financial strength.\u201D","In December, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick confirmed to CNBC that his firm holds Tether\u2019s Treasury bills, quelling concerns that Tether\u2019s stablecoins weren\u2019t fully backed.","Tether is by far the largest stablecoin by market cap, with its closest competitor \u2013 Circle \u2013 boasting $26.7 billion of coins in circulation. Last month, Circle filed for an initial public offering.","Tether\u2019s financial achievements in 2023 reflect a year of substantial growth and strategic asset management. With a focus on diversification and maintaining a solid reserve, the company has reinforced its position in the stablecoin sector. As Tether moves forward, its continued emphasis on financial stability and asset-backed security will be important for its operations and for maintaining user confidence."],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$6.2B.","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5.6 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.85","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100 billion mark","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.85 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$5.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3.6 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1B","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$97 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"fourth quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 31, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Cantor Fitzgerald","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Treasuries","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.85","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$26.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$82.06 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Howard Lutnick","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$80.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CTO Paolo Ardoino","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$91.6 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tether\u2019s Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$6.2 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Stablecoin","Tether","USDT"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
