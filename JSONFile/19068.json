Just annoyed, disappointed, and ready to fight.","I am confident that the products we offer are legal and that our work is on the right side of history. But it\u2019s been clear for a while that rather than\u2026","\u2014 hayden.eth ðŸ¦„ (@haydenzadams) April 10, 2024","","Meanwhile, Uniswap Labs\u2019 Chief Legal Officer Marvin Ammori accused the SEC of abusing its power.","He cited past instances where judges have ruled just that, noting that in its lawsuit versus Ripple, \u201Ca judge ruled (the SEC) didn\u2019t act out of a faithful allegiance to the law.\u201D","Additionally, he noted that against Grayscale, three judges ruled the SEC broke the law in denying a Bitcoin ETF, stating that the SEC had \u201CactedÂ arbitrarily and capriciously.\u201C","1\/ Today\u2019s Wells notice against @Uniswap is disappointing, but is not unexpected from this SEC","It\u2019s another abuse of power \u2013 unsurprising from an SEC that:","Last month, a federal judge ruled committed a \"gross abuse of power\" by lying in court about a crypto project","\u2014 Marvin Ammori (@ammori) April 10, 2024","","According to hayden.eth, the SEC\u2019s arguments against Uniswap Labs are even weaker.","\u201CThe SEC has authority only over \u201Csecurities\u201D \u2013 not any asset represented by a particular file format or technical standard,\u201D he continued. \u201CThe Uniswap Protocol, web app, and wallet don\u2019t meet the legal definitions of securities exchange or broker. Just weeks ago, the judge in SEC v. Coinbase dismissed the claim that crypto wallets were brokers \u2013 *even if* the tokens at issue were securities.\u201D","Though leaders at Uniswap Labs seem confident and resolute in their fight against the SEC, UNI traders are wavering.","The Uni price dropped by around 11% on the day and is back under $10.","But these losses could be set to worsen, with UNI having just broken a key upward support level.","UNI is now probing support at $9.80. A break below this level could accelerate the token\u2019s losses toward the next major support zone around $8.","Investors who are confident that the SEC\u2019s lawsuit won\u2019t be able to kill off the Uniswap Protocol might see a retest of such levels as a great opportunity to take positions in UNI.","Indeed, Uniswap is one of the leading multi-chain DEX protocols, with $2 trillion in lifetime volumes.
