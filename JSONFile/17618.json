The alert system also played a crucial role in signaling the security breach when Uniswap founder Hayden Adams\u2019 Twitter account was hacked later in October.","Senior Product Manager at Metamask B√°rbara Schorchit told Cointelegraph that the alert feature played an important role in helping users save over $1 million during the recent Ledger Connect Kit incident in December.","\u201CNearly 100 front-end DApps were compromised, yet every MetaMask user who opted into the security alerts powered by Blockaid were protected, preventing what we estimate to be ~$1.15 million worth of assets from being stolen,\u201D Schorchit said.\n","The introduction of the new security features coincides with substantial user growth for the wallet, approaching its peak in 2022. Monthly active users surged from 19 million in September 2023 to 30 million in January 2024.","Two weeks ago, MetaMask announced a partnership with popular trading platform Robinhood, according to MetaMask developer Consensys.","The collaboration will allow MetaMask users to buy digital assets with Robinhood\u2019s order flow. Simultaneously, Robinhood account holders can fund and transfer their crypto assets to their MetaMask wallet."],"entity":[{"type":"Polygon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BNB Smart Chain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MetaMask","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hayden Adams","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MetaMask Security Alerts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 20, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Blockaid","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Linea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Metamask B√°rbara Schorchit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Robinhood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Uniswap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Schorchit","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Arbitrum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Security Alerts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"19 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["ConsenSys","crypto scams","MetaMask"],"authors":["Brian Yue"]}
