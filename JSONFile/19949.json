This appearance coincides with his absence from the court hearing scheduled for Jan. 29 in Denver, where he was due to face charges related to the alleged crypto fraud.","According to Newsweek, Regalado intertwined biblical teachings with financial advice during his sermons at the conference in Zambia. He then addressed the congregation with a focus on monetary matters.","\u201CI\u2019m going to speak to you today and I am going to speak to you about finances, and I\u2019m going [to] speak to you about how to make money the Kingdom way,\u201D said Regalado.","Regalado also alluded to his involvement in the crypto world.
