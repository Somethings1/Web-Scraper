price can be attributed to investors taking profits, Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in a recent note.Â ","He said that many of these investors had entered the market during the downturns of 2022 and 2023, and they have now decided to capitalize on the significant price appreciation witnessed in recent months.Â ","Additionally, ETF investors who entered the market early in 2024 and saw substantial gainsÂ onÂ their shares are also participating in profit-taking activities.","\u201CLast week saw stagnant demand for BTC ETFs,
