27 representatives from various law enforcement agencies.","Over the course ofÂ three days, participants immersed themselves in learning fundamental techniques and practical tools crucial for conducting effective investigations intoÂ crypto-crimes.Â ","\u201CDrawing from real-world cases, sessions delved into basic methods for tracing criminal transactions across diverse blockchain networks,\u201D per the announcement.Â ","The training also provided a platform for the exchange of good practices among the participants, who gained valuable insights into specialized analytics software and open-source tools relevant to the field.Â ","These tools empower investigators to trace transactions conducted on different blockchains, assess the risks associated with specific addresses and exposure to illicit funds, and identify clusters of various transactions, among other capabilities.","\u201CIn the ever-changing landscape of financial technology, it is crucial for Armenia to strengthen its domestic law enforcement capabilities, particularly in the realm of investigating and tracing virtual assets,\u201D Kurban Babayev, economic adviser at OCEEA,
