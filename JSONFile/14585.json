You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","The House on Wednesday approved a decision to overturn the SEC\u2019s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 in a majority vote. In the normal course of events, the measure would then move to the Senate, but, in an unexpected twist, Biden has warned he will veto the bill.","\u201CThis move makes such little sense that it's highly likely the White House doesn't even understand the issues at stake, and is just going along with a certain limited and unreasonably biased yet influential faction,\u201D Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201CCrypto is Macro Now\u201D market research newsletter, said on X. \u201CJust who is the government serving here? Who is it protecting?\u201D","Acheson\u2019s incredulity is perhaps justifiable. Critics have called SAB 121 \u201Cobscure,\u201D a \u201Cdiktat\u201D and a \u201Cpernicious weed.\u201D Since 2022, when the bulletin was posted, digital asset custodians have had to treat the assets they\u2019re holding on behalf of clients as a liability on their own balance sheets and hold additional capital to offset those liabilities.","Crypto advocates see the rule as onerous and capital intensive, and, interestingly, so do banks and other financial incumbents. In February, major banking and securities industry bodies including the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), American Bankers Association (ABA), Financial Services Forum (FSF) and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) wrote a letter to the SEC asking for amendments to the bulletin\u2019s requirements.","\u201CSAB 121 will have a chilling effect on banking organizations\u2019 ability to develop responsible use cases for distributed ledger technology (DLT) more broadly,\u201D the letter states. Custody is already a fairly low-margin business, and asking institutions to hold a dollar for every asset in custody, as an extra insurance on top of, just being able to keep the assets safe is a bit much.","But it\u2019s not only industry participants that are complaining. In 2022, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigated SAB 121 and found that the measure warranted a congressional review because they skipped over the necessary public review and comment periods. In other words, the SEC tried to pass off a rule as a lowly memo.","This argument was then picked up by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Reps. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) and Mike Flood (R-Neb.), who posted matching resolutions to revoke the rule.","\"The SEC issued SAB 121 without conferring with prudential regulators despite the accounting standard\u2019s effects on financial institutions\u2019 treatment of custodial assets, and the SEC issued SAB 121 without going through the notice-and-comment process,\" Rep. Flood said at the time. \"In the face of overreach by a regulator, it is the role of Congress to serve as a check.\"","House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) also picked up the baton to criticize an overzealous SEC, saying \u201Cbecause they called it staff guidance, the SEC could avoid public comment and the rulemaking process governed by the Administrative Procedure Act or APA.\u201D","It was Flood and Nickel\u2019s bill that Biden threatened to veto, in what is being seen as a promise to back SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. \u201CLimiting the SEC\u2019s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty,\u201D the Biden administration wrote in a Wednesday statement.","See also: House Votes to Erase SEC Crypto Policy While President Biden Vows Veto","SABs are not enforceable securities law, but instead guidance for both industry participants and the SEC itself when making legal interpretations \u2013 though they do not reflect consensus among the SEC\u2019s five commissioners. They also generally do not go through a review process, which was the problem at hand.","Speaking at a two-day \"SEC Speaks\" event last month, Commissioner Hester Peirce commented::","\"Nobody can challenge the diktats because they're not final agency action, but compliance is mandatory for anyone who is trying to avoid SEC delays, denials and enforcement and examination scrutiny. So everybody silently complies,\u201D Peirce said.","\"The bottom line is that rules of such broad effect should be set by the full commission, not by the staff that reports only to the chairman.\"","In a better world, that may be true. But this time it seems like Biden may get the final word.","See also: 'Boden' Memecoin Surges After Trump Quips About It","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank Policy Institute (BPI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"American Bankers Association (ABA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"White House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wiley Nickel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mike Flood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cynthia Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Noelle Acheson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Financial Services Forum (FSF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hester Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wyo.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House Votes to Erase SEC Crypto Policy While President Biden Vows Veto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DLT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Neb.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Joseph Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"APA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SAB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Boden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nickel","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","The Node","Newsletters","Biden Administration","SEC","Accounting","Custody"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
