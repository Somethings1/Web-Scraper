The ETF was created to short MicroStrategy, one of the most recognizable holders of Bitcoin.","The Blockstream CEO shared his views on an X thread, calling the ETF a \u201Cterrible product\u201D unlikely to yield the desired results.","He reasoned that even if investors considered MicroStrategy overvalued, the ETF would still face great risk due to auto-rebalancing in a volatile market.","have to say this is a terrible product ðŸ™‚ even if you believed MSTR premium above #bitcoin NAV was too high, you're 2x auto-rebalancing naked short MSTR which is very bitcoin correlated. and these rebalancing strategies slip like crazy, on a volatile underlying, bleeding your\u2026","\u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) April 7, 2024","","\u201CEven if MSTR premium compressed but BTC price doubles, you\u2019re 2x short!\u201D he said. \u201CPrice will overwhelm NAV correction, so you\u2019ll get rekt anyway. and auto-rebalancing volatile underlying assets erodes capital to slippage in sideways chop FAST. And MSTR is bitcoin correlated and volatile!\u201D","Per an SEC press release, the Defiance ETF proposed on March 7 was filed under the TIDAL TRUST II financial group. The ETF seeks to profit from potential declines in MicroStrategy\u2019s (MSTR) stock price by taking a leveraged short position (-200%) against the company\u2019s shares.","Back cited MicroStrategy\u2019s massive Bitcoin holdings as a key reason why he sees the idea of a short ETF as a weak strategy. MicroStrategy currently boasts a portfolio of over 210,000 BTC, worth around $15.2 billion \u2013 representing over 1% of the total Bitcoin supply that will ever exist.","With MicroStrategy\u2019s valuation now heavily tied to its rising Bitcoin investments, Back believes the ETF\u2019s 2x auto-rebalancing mechanism to maintain a short exposure could prove disastrous.","Before Back\u2019s warnings, popular short seller Kerrisdale Capital announced last month that it would short MicroStrategy and long Bitcoin. The hedge fund stated that investors no longer needed MicroStrategy to access Bitcoin, and as such, they saw no reason to \u201Cjustify paying well over double for the same coin,\u201D especially with increasing access to Bitcoin through brokerages, exchanges, and ETFs.","While MicroStrategy\u2019s CEO Michael Saylor continues to face criticism over his Bitcoin acquisition strategy, he reaffirmed that holding BTC is part of the company\u2019s long-term commitment. At a Bloomberg event earlier this year, Saylor articulated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, asserting its technical superiority over competitors, including those with higher market capitalization.","","\u201CBitcoin is technically superior to those asset classes,\u201D he explained. \u201CAnd that being the case, there\u2019s just no reason to sell the winner to buy the losers.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Blockstream","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MSTR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NAV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"200%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Adam Back","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kerrisdale Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Defiance ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$15.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 7, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Adam Back","Bitcoin ETF","MicroStrategy"],"authors":["Jimmy Aki"]}
