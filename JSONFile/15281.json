Since then 10 additional networks have been added, including Ethereum, Litecoin and Dogecoin.","BigQuery is a \u201Cserverless and cost-effective enterprise data warehouse,\u201D designed for \u201Cpractitioners of various coding skills,\u201D according to the program\u2019s website.","A key advantage, according to Google Cloud, is that users might be able to retrieve the historical data from an off-chain provider faster than querying the blockchain directly.","Friday's announcement comes as Google Cloud says it's expanding efforts in blockchain despite the industry still being mired in the \"crypto winter\" market malaise.","\u201COver the past 18 months we\u2019ve been investing in this space, we\u2019ve continued to hire, we\u2019ve continued to grow not only our business development and our go-to-market teams but also our product and engineering capabilities,\u201D James Tromans, global head of Web3, Google Cloud, told CoinDesk TV in an interview last week. \u201CWe\u2019re really beginning to show that we\u2019re not just fly-by-night and not just here when the time is going well.\u201D","Other blockchains added recently to the BigQuery program include Avalanche, Arbitrum, Cronos, Ethereum\u2019s Goerli test network; Fantom Opera; NEAR and Tron, according to a press release on Friday.","Google Cloud said it also will improve the Bitcoin BigQuery dataset by adding support for the Ordinals project, which exploded in popularity earlier this year as a way to generate NFTs on the largest and original blockchain network.","The BigQuery program makes historical blockchain data available for exploration, designed to overcome the underlying network\u2019s limited capability for \u201Cshort time-scale reporting on specific or aggregated money flows stored in the ledger,\u201D according to Google Cloud.","Expanding the program to include more blockchains also has allowed for \u201Cmulti-chain meta analyses, as well as integration with conventional financial record processing systems,\u201D the company said.","According to the press release, blockchain foundations, Web3 analytics firms, developers and customers are demanding \u201Ca more comprehensive view across the crypto landscape, and to be able to query more chains.\u201D","Data queries might focus on the number of NFTs minted across three specific blockchains, fee comparisons between networks or how many active wallets sit atop chains that are compatible with the widely popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) programming environment."],"entity":[{"type":"James Tromans","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Arbitrum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Google Cloud","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fantom Opera","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cronos","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2018","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Google","Google Cloud","Avalanche","Arbitrum","Cronos","Ethereum","Fantom","Goerli","Near","Polkadot","Polygon","Tron","Bitcoin","Dogecoin"],"authors":["Bradley Keoun"]}
