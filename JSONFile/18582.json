This surge comes after a period of massive outflows, with Grayscale\u2019s GBTC trust still experiencing a historical net outflow of $17.4 billion since its inception.","Grayscale\u2019s GBTC did manage a modest single-day inflow of $3.9 million, marking its second consecutive positive day after recording $63 million inflows on Friday for the first time since the US SEC approved 10 new ETFs in January 2024. GBTC share price also witnessed an uptick after positive inflows.","Fidelity\u2019s FBTC ETF led the charge with a massive $99.2 million single-day inflow, bringing its total historical net inflow to $8.1 billion. Ark Invest and 21Shares\u2019 ARKB ETF also saw significant interest, attracting $75.6 million in a single day, pushing its total net inflow to $2.2 billion.","With a combined net asset value of $52.2 billion, these ETFs now represent 4.19% of the total Bitcoin market value. The total historical net inflow for all spot Bitcoin ETFs sits at $11.8 billion, highlighting a significant shift in investor sentiment.","In a bid to compete with lower-cost rivals, Grayscale announced plans in March to spin off a \u201CBitcoin Mini Trust\u201D from GBTC. This new vehicle would hold a portion of GBTC\u2019s assets, but details regarding its exact fee structure remain under wraps by the company.","Bitcoin\u2019s 200-day moving average reached an all-time high of $50,178 on Monday. This key technical indicator suggests a long-term bullish trend for the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency.","This positive signal comes after a temporary dip following the Bitcoin network\u2019s block reward halving on April 20th. The price briefly dropped to nearly $57,000, but the recent surge in the 200-day moving average indicates a potential for sustained growth.","Bitcoin's 200 day moving average just hit a new all-time high.","GBTC saw the first day of inflows in 78 days.","Don't get lulled to sleep by bitcoin going sideways. The long-term thesis is as strong as ever.","Here is my segment on @SquawkCNBC this morning. pic.twitter.com\/BG6GkzqVIi","\u2014 Pomp ðŸŒª (@APompliano) May 6, 2024","",""],"entity":[{"type":"this morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"$99.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"4.19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$63 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$75.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$57,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$217 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$11.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$50,178","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$52.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 20th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$8.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$17.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 6th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3.9 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Spot ETF","GBTC","USA"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
