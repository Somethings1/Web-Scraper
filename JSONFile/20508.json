Still, Hashdex clarified that the permission was not for a new fund but instead for its Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF to be converted into a spot Bitcoin ETF.","The conversion is pending SEC review, and once finalized, it means 11 spot BTC ETFs will be trading on US exchanges.","","While BlackRock naturally grabbed much attention due to its sheer size, Grayscale, a crypto-native firm in the asset management space, also achieved success.","The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust marked an all-time high daily volume of 56 million shares on the debut day.","Notably, GBTC has a 10-year history and stands out in the ETF lineup as an existing Bitcoin investment product for accredited investors.","","On X, at least one popular member of the crypto community argued that the ETF launch had been \u201Cterribly unsuccessful\u201D due to the fact that outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) made up around 50% of the sector\u2019s overall trading volume.","However, the argument was later countered by Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who instead called the launch a \u201CTERRIBLY HUGE SUCCESS.\u201D","\u201CBy all metrics: volume, # of trades, flows, media coverage, it was smashing success, historical,\u201D Balchunas wrote.","Lot of ppl sending me this tweet. On one hand, if GBTC outflows were big, he's right it was net neutral day for btc buy\/sell by ETFs. On the other, it was a TERRIBLY HUGE SUCCESS. By all metrics: volume, # of trades, flows, media coverage it was smashing success, historical.
