The anti-SEC memecoin is part of a movement to counter what its creators see as unjust regulatory pressure.","Marco Monaco, a member of the NWG initiative, clarified that, despite his involvement with the zkEVM ecosystem Linea, the project is entirely separate from Linea and Consensys.","\u201CMy involvement in this project is 100% at a personal level, and I\u2019m not doing this in my official @LineaBuild role,\u201D Monaco said. \u201CThis project is not tied at all to Linea or @Consensys, even if $NWG will stand with similar companies and support them during their journey against the SEC.\u201D","The official NWG account posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the project will \u201Cstand against Gary Gensler and the SEC, who are unlawfully threatening digital property by attacking Ethereum and open-source developers.\u201D","GM Crypto!","Let us introduce NotWifGary, a new community in the space that wants to emerge and go live to stand our ground against Gary Gensler and the SEC, who are unlawfully threatening digital property by attacking Ethereum and open-source developers. pic.twitter.com\/nI25CReFeE","\u2014 NotWifGary \u2013 $NWG (@NotWifGary) May 15, 2024","","NWG will be categorized explicitly as a CultureCoin. It will be launched in a highly decentralized manner with a fair launch strategy. The 12 original project supporters, who are all publicly known, plan to deploy 100% of the token allocation in a liquidity pool.","According to the project\u2019s website, NWG will be launched on Linea as an ERC20 token, managed through a multi-sig wallet involving the original project supporters.Â The liquidity pool for NWG will be bootstrapped through community donations to ensure sufficient decentralization and fairness. Importantly, donations will not entitle contributors to NWG tokens but will earn them the \u201C$NWG Launch Team\u201D Soulbound Token (SBT).","Democratic Representative Wiley Nickel recently commented that the SEC\u2019s actions are turning crypto into a \u201Cpolitical football,\u201D unnecessarily forcing President Biden to \u201Cchoose sides\u201D on the matter. Nickel\u2019s comments came after the proposed Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 rule, requiring SEC-reporting entities to record custodial crypto as liabilities on their balance sheets.","According to government records, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, known for her critical stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, may lose her position on June 5. Crenshaw, sworn in alongside Commissioner Hester M. Peirce in August 2020, has not been re-nominated, and recent White House statements suggest no immediate plans to fill her position.","This news comes amid rumors of SEC chairman Gary Gensler potentially resigning, although Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret believes this is unlikely during an election year.","Also, concerning the strict SEC stance on crypto, Kraken recently urged the US court to dismiss the SEC\u2019s claims that it operated an unregistered securities trading platform, arguing that such claims could significantly reorder the US financial regulatory structure.","Kraken believes that the SEC\u2019s broad interpretation of its jurisdiction, mainly through the Howey test, would unnecessarily expand its authority beyond its intended limits, a matter that should be debated in Congress."],"entity":[{"type":"$NWG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201D Monaco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GM Crypto!","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"White House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wiley Nickel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hester M.
