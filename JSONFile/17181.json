The country has launched numerous test pilots of its CBDC across various provinces, with over 200 million people already taking part in trials.","Most recently, the coastal province of Jiangsu promised to launch a platform that will allow citizens to pay education fees using the country\u2019s CBDC. ","Other central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, are also exploring the potential of CBDCs.","However, there are still some concerns about these digital currencies.  ","One of the main concerns is privacy and security. CBDCs rely on complex and sophisticated technology, and there are concerns that they could be vulnerable to hacking and other cyber risks. ","Privacy is also a concern, as CBDCs could potentially provide central banks with unprecedented levels of access to individuals\u2019 financial data.","In fact, for these reasons, Florida has recently banned the use of CBDCs as money within the state."],"entity":[{"type":"Lee Seung","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bank of Japan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Florida","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jiangsu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Samsung Electronics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The Korea Herald","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201D Bank of Korea","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Samsung","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank of Korea","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Galaxy Watch","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"People\u2019s Bank of China","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Seoul","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","Samsung","South Korea"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
