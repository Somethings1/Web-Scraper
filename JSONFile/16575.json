The country\u2019s opposition-controlled congress said it was illegal to borrow against the oil reserves. In 2019, U.S. authorities sanctioned a Russian bank for financing the Petro.","The Venezuelan government made several attempts to link the Petro with services, for example, it was required to obtain passports to fund a social housing initiative and the minimum wage was 50% pegged to it.","Any remaining petros are being converted to bolivars, the ailing local currency, according to one report. The final nail in the coffin for the Petro was a corruption scandal over financial irregularities around using crypto assets for oil operations which led to the resignation of the petroleum minister Tareck El Aissami and a crackdown on bitcoin mining operations, AFP reported.","The Venezuelan government could not be reached for comment.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra.","\n","\n","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Venezuela","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Patria Platform","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Petro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nicolas Maduro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Feb. 2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tareck El Aissami","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AFP","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Petro","Oil","Venezuela","Crypto","Sanctions","Maduro"],"authors":["Amitoj Singh"]}
