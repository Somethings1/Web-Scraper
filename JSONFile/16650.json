According to Attestor\u2019s documents, Lemma Technologies has \u201Cno known assets\u201D other than Bang\u2019s transferred claims.","But after making a deal to sell its claims to Attestor for approximately $58 million \u2013 35% of the initial value of its accounts \u2013 Attestor says Lemma and its South Korean owners got cold feet. According to Attestor\u2019s complaint, Lemma \u201Cbegan to assert that complications had arisen\u201D regarding its authority to sell the claims, and that Bang could be \u201Cexposed to liability to his business associates\u201D if the accounts were transferred to Attestor.","While they delayed, Attestor claims Lemma Technologies \u201Cbegan to attempt to renegotiate\u201D the agreed-upon purchase price of the accounts \u2013 evidence, Attestor says, of the company\u2019s \u201Cseller\u2019s remorse.\u201D","At the time of Attestor\u2019s purchase of Lemma Technologies\u2019 claims, the 35% price was above the typical price paid to claims holders, according to data from Claims Market. But in the months following the agreement, while both parties were working on due diligence, the average bid for FTX claims steadily climbed, reaching 68% by the end of 2023. The most recent data from Claims Market puts the average bid for FTX claims at 92%.","The value for FTX claims has risen along with investors\u2019 confidence that they will get their money back at the end of the bankruptcy process: in January, lawyers for the defunct exchange said they expected to be able to pay back customers in full, aided by the rising price of bitcoin.","Lemma has not publicly responded to Attestor\u2019s suit or filed a defense against it. CoinDesk\u2019s request for comment, sent to two email addresses connected to Bang in the court documents, remained unanswered at the time of publication.","Attestor\u2019s suit against Lemma is not the only legal battle Bang is facing.","Along with two other executives connected to Haru Invest, a South Korean crypto yield platform, Bang was arrested in February after Korean authorities accused the trio of embezzling 1.1 trillion won \u2013 approximately $828 million \u2013 from customers. It is unclear whether Bang remains in custody.","Haru Invest halted withdrawals and deposits last June, citing \u201Ccertain issues\u201D with one of its service providers. The company later announced that it was filing both a criminal complaint and a civil lawsuit against B&S Holdings, which acted as a consignment operator for the platform, for allegedly providing fraudulent management reports.","Bang is, according to Haru Invest and local media, the majority shareholder of B&S Holdings.","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"92%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$58 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Attestor","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Svalbard Holdings Limited","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jan. 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lemma \u201C","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lemma Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"35%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Attestor Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 18, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Haru Invest","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lemma","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Claims Market","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$828 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$166 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"68%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"B&S Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Haru Invest","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","FTX","Bankruptcy"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
