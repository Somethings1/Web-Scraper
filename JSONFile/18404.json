Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong first mentioned implementing the network through a social media platform post in a discussion with users exploring a new scaling solution.¬†","The Bitcoin Lightning Network offers several benefits for Bitcoin users, including instant payments. This means transactions on the Lightning Network are almost instant, allowing users to send and receive payments in seconds rather than waiting for confirmation times on the Bitcoin blockchain.","Another perk of the network is scalability. By moving a significant portion of transactions off-chain, the Lightning Network helps alleviate congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, increasing the overall scalability of the network.","Lower fees is another benefit. Since transactions on the Lightning Network occur off-chain, they typically incur lower fees compared to on-chain transactions, making micropayments and small transactions more feasible.","Lightning Network transactions are private by default, as they do not appear on the public blockchain. This can offer users greater privacy compared to on-chain transactions."],"entity":[{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 3, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase VP of Corporate and Business Development","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase Global","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lightspark","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shan Aggarwal","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Coinbase"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
