cryptocurrency buying, holding, and exchanging in 2017.Â ","With over 40 million customers worldwide, Revolut has emerged as the largest fintech company in theÂ UK.","AccordingÂ to a statement, Revolut designed the new platform to compete with leading crypto exchanges by providing easy on\/off-ramping and low fees.Â ","Although initially targeted at professional traders, Revolut X is

March, which enablesÂ users to purchase crypto directly in their Web3 wallets through a partnership with MetaMask developer Consensys.","The rollout of Revolut X signifies the company\u2019s renewed focus on crypto services after suspending crypto trading for itsÂ UKÂ business clients and terminating crypto services in the United States due to a challenging regulatory environment.","In December, Revolut announced the suspension of crypto trading for itsÂ UKÂ business customers, citing the need to adapt to new requirements set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in October.Â ","The FCA\u2019s crypto advertising rules, including a cooling-off period for first-time investors, aimed to enhance transparency and accuracy inÂ theÂ marketingÂ ofÂ crypto products.Â ","However, several firms, including PayPal, encountered difficulties complying with these regulations.","Additionally, in August, Revolut halted its crypto services in the United States, citing regulatory uncertainties and challenges.Â ","The decision followed the delisting ofÂ certainÂ tokens, including Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), which theÂ U.S.Â Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged to be unregistered securities.Â ","In a separate development, former Revolut employees have launched aÂ new crypto exchange called X10, raising $6.5 million in its first funding round.Â "],"entity":[{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Revolut\u2019s Head of Crypto Exchange
