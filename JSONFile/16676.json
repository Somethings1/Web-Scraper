In both cases, transactions or computations would only need to carried out on-chain for verification or to address a dispute.","In response to Linus's post about the new white paper on X (formerly Twitter), one user suggested BitStream could do \"for storage space what BitVM does for execution time,\" with which Linus agreed and confirmed that the two proposals could be combined.","Another poster on X asked, \"What makes this better than the numerous storage cryptocurrencies we have had before?\"","Linus answered, \"It's Bitcoin.\"","Read More: Bitcoin Is Fundamentally Different From Other Cryptocurrencies: Fidelity Digital Assets","Edited by Bradley Keoun.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Linus","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fidelity Digital Assets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BitStream","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Linus","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nov. 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Robin Linus","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bradley Keoun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Decentralization","File Sharing","Bitcoin"],"authors":["Jamie Crawley"]}
