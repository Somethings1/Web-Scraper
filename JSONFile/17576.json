Many also believe that the approval of spot ETFs would increase transparency in the spot market.","The new wave of a Bitcoin spot ETF was sparked by BlackRock\u2019s application in June 2023. Many consider it to be the real deal following its previous successes with the SEC. ","The Commission had notably turned down all previous applications for a spot BTC ETF in the US despite numerous applications by leading firms. ","Per the report, there is growing optimism over the prospects of an application scaling the Commission\u2019s hammer. ","Several applications were filed by firms following BlackRock including WisdomTree, Invesco, Valkyrie, etc with several improvements added. ","JP Morgan noted that the re-filing of the application by BlackRock and other firms puts them at an advantage as they have now ticked all known boxes and await approval in the future. ","The buzz around the spot ETF skyrocketed the price of BTC above $31,000 with bulls predicting a much higher price in coming weeks. ","At press time, BTC exchanges hands at $30,404."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$30,404","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Valkyrie","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$31,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"JP Morgan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Blackrock","ETF"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
