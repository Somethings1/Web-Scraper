However, ETH performed stronger, advancing 1.5% over the past 24 hours, compared to BTC's almost 3% decline during the same period. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was down 1.6% during the day.","Amid the volatile episode, liquidations across all leveraged crypto derivative positions soared to over $350 million during the day, the most since May 1, CoinGlass data shows.","Liquidations happen when an exchange closes a leveraged trading position due to a partial or total loss of the trader\u2019s initial money down or \"margin\" \u2013 if the trader fails to meet the margin requirements or doesn't have enough funds to keep the trade open.","The lion's share of the wiped-out positions were longs betting in rising prices, worth roughly $250 million, suggesting that over-leveraged traders were caught off-guard by the sudden price plunge. ETH traders took the biggest hit, with $132 million of liquidations, followed by $70 million in BTC derivatives liquidations.","Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."],"entity":[{"type":"May 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$350 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$250 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3,800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$3,900","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$70 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3,500","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Aoyon Ashraf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$132 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$68,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$68,300","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$66,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Market Wrap","Markets","Bitcoin","Ether","Liquidations"],"authors":["Krisztian Sandor"]}
