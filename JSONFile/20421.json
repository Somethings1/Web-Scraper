Additionally, Gemini is set to contribute $40 million towards the Genesis Global Capital bankruptcy, aiming to benefit Earn customers, in coordination with the Bankruptcy Court.","\u201CGemini failed to conduct due diligence on an unregulated third party, later accused of massive fraud, harming Earn customers who were suddenly unable to access their assets after Genesis Global Capital experienced a financial meltdown,\u201D said Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris.","\u201CToday\u2019s settlement is a win for Earn customers, who have a right to the assets they entrusted to Gemini,\u201D said Harris.","Launched on Feb. 1, 2021, the Earn program allowed Gemini customers to lend their cryptocurrencies to the unregulated GGC. Customers earned interest, but Gemini failed to properly oversee GGC, leading to a default on nearly $1 billion in loans by November 2022 and GGC\u2019s subsequent bankruptcy.","This lack of diligence and inadequate reserves by Gemini resulted in over 200,000 Earn customers being unable to access their assets, causing both reputational and financial damage to Gemini and its users."],"entity":[{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York Department of Financial Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bankruptcy Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the Bankruptcy Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$40 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DFS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"97%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$37 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Harris","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$700 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 28, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Adrienne A.
