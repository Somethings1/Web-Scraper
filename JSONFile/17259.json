The chips can be digitally signed, and reveals the history of the brand, that are recorded on-chain.","The collection featured 60 pieces of garments at the event, with phone-scannable NFC tags, a report said.","Vintage Wrangler + @mntge_io Tech ðŸ”—ðŸ“²","Hand sourced vintage western shirts, denim jackets and patches featuring NFC technology that links to a digital receipt with garment specific details and a claimable 3d asset.","Available only at the Future Fashion Summit. pic.twitter.com\/fQpn6x7FpN","\u2014 MNTGE (@mntge_io) February 22, 2024","","Sean Gormley, global creative and concept director for Wrangler, noted that customers showed interest to know the brand\u2019s history.","\u201CThey want to know more about how the brand is related to the rodeo and who buys our more exclusive products. It makes the feeling of being a customer richer if the brand is willing to reveal more about what goes into the product or how it\u2019s made.\u201D","As a result, the scannable tags links to a customized web page that features Wrangler\u2019s 77-year-old legacy and story.","Further, the vintage western shirts and denim jackets were sourced from the 1970s through the 1990s by MNTGE and re-fashioned with the nascent blockchain integration. Some of the items were decades-old Wrangler pieces reportedly discovered on the floor of a barn in Germany, Gormley noted. He apparently purchased them through Instagram.","\u201CThere\u2019s a nice connection between vintage pieces and storytelling. We have a program called Reborn focused on bringing old garments back to life.\u201D","The brand is soon planning to add Reborn\u2019s story, which customers can discover by scanning the NFC chip, he added.","Additionally, the NFC tags also allow for tracing the item throughout its lifespan using blockchain. \u201CWe can update the metadata every time the item is scanned, resold or passed down,\u201D Gormley noted.","Besides, this would ease customers on what label, age of the Wrangler jean or fabric to look for. Gormley believes that providing brand education and authentication could differentiate them from resale channels selling Wrangler.","\u201CIf a customer can get an authenticated Wrangler jacket with a bit more story and a bit more insight, that can give them more style credentials.\u201D","The collaboration comes alongside Wrangler\u2019s partnership with Grammy award-winning recording artist Leon Bridges, and under the name \u2018Mr. Wrangler\u2019. The product is an NFT, launched to mark the brand\u2019s 75th anniversary, and costs 1.947 Ethereum or $2,609.17."],"entity":[{"type":"$2,609.17","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sean Gormley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Paris","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wrangler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 22, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1990s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1970s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gormley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Germany","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Future Fashion Summit","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["NFT","Wrangler"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
