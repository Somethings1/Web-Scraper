This is the first time the NTS has taxed South Korean airdrop recipients.","Bithumb said that it would \u201Cimmediately\u201D compensate its customers for anything they had to pay the NTS as a result of receiving its airdrops.","However, the exchange announced that it was \u201Cfiling a tax appeal\u201D against the national tax body.","Bithumb argued that \u201Cvirtual assets and commission cashback distributed via events are a type of free gift or sales benefit.\u201D As such, the exchange said, these are \u201Cexempt from taxation.\u201D","The media outlet quoted South Korean tax experts as stating that the appeal\u2019s success would hinge on \u201Cthe nature of the event giveaways.\u201D","Korea's major cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb said Friday that it will cover all the 40 billion won ($30 million) of taxes imposed on the winners of its crypto airdrop events.https:\/\/t.co\/36G4cGNQRv","\u2014 The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) May 10, 2024","","While the NTS appears to view the tokens as \u201Ca prize,\u201D Bithumb insists these are \u201Cfree gifts.\u201D","The exchange may argue, experts noted, that it is following the example of securities providers, who often give out stocks to new account holders.","In more conventional cases, shopping outlets that give high-spending customers gift certificates also avoid legal issues. In neither case do recipients pay taxes, experts added.","Again, this is because the NTS does not see such handouts as competition \u201Cprizes,\u201D but as \u201Cfree gifts.\u201D","The media outlet warned that appeals to the NTS are often time-consuming, concluding that \u201Cit may take up to several years for a ruling to emerge.\u201D","Bithumb is currently aiming to become the first South Korean crypto exchange to float on the nation\u2019s stock exchange."],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"40 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bithumb","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NTS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hanguk Kyunjae","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$37","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"22%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"The Korea Herald","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bithumb","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$61 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 10, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$30 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"National Tax Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 10","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bithumb","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
