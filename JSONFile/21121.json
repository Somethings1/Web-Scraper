That\u2019s the day when a software update will halve BTC mining rewards.","History suggests we\u2019re on the cusp of a bull run. The previous three halvings have all increased the price of the original cryptocurrency as the halved supply struggled to meet consistent demand. There are some fears, however, that this year the halving may have already been priced in.","However, BCH\u2019s price chart for the last three months tells a very different story to its namesake.","At the beginning of March, Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies began a rally that peaked by the middle.","BCH initially rallied in step with them, but the momentum fell by March 3.","","On the other end of the chart, BCH rallied from late March to early April, independent of Bitcoin, which remained stagnant over the same period.","Back in 2017, Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. ","The faction that forked from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was in favor of larger block sizes, which allow the network to process more transactions per second.","However, bigger block sizes mean miners need more power to do their business. This makes mining only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations.","The added speed enabled Bitcoin Cash to become the cryptocurrency of utility for the big block supporters, who see Bitcoin primarily as a means of payments. The original Bitcoin maxis see Bitcoin more as a store of value.","The uncertainty around Bitcoin\u2019s halving underscores the volatility of crypto in general. It is still very much a bet, although early projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are a safer bet than others.","Still, the crypto world abounds with plenty of useful applications that hint at a glowing and prosperous future. One such application is the world of GambleFi.","A new ICO for Solana GameFi token Mega Dice (DICE) started this week and it has already raised over $300,000.","","DICE is the native token for Mega Dice\u2019s Telegram-based crypto casino, with certain games requiring the token to play. It can also be used for staking casino cashback, airdrop prizes, and special NFT benefits.","Curious?
