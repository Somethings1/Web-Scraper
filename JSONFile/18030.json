He has been detained at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center since a judge revoked his bail in August after claims that he attempted to tamper with witnesses.","While his lavish lifestyle funded by FTX\u2019s cryptocurrency trading empire is now a distant memory, Bankman-Fried has learned to manage the peculiarities of the federal prison economy. According to sources familiar with the matter, pouches of mackerel fillets are the preferred jailhouse currency, replacing cigarettes that were banned.","One stablecoin for everything","Mackerel\nMackerel 🐟 Mackerel\n🐟 🐟\nMackerel🐟 SBF 🐟Mackerel\n🐟 🐟\nMackerel 🐟 Mackerel\nMackerel","\u2014 Moni 🧙\u200D♂️ (@getmoni_io) November 24, 2023","","Bankman-Fried has used his stash of fish to barter and pay fellow inmates for services. In one instance, he traded some mackerel packs for a haircut from another detainee to maintain his signature curly mop-top hairstyle ahead of his high-profile trial.","The once high-flying crypto mogul has also been generously doling out investing tips to prison guards as per the WSJ report, offering his insights on digital currencies from his former life as a Bitcoin billionaire.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s spokesman Mark Botnick confirmed that the disgraced entrepreneur is \u201Cdoing the best he can under the circumstances.\u201D","The Brooklyn jail conditions are a far cry from Bankman-Fried\u2019s former tropical lifestyle and $35 million penthouse in the Bahamas, however.","The detention center has faced longstanding complaints of poor facilities, severe understaffing, and bleak living conditions. Bankman-Fried\u2019s access to food and medications has improved since his lawyer initially reported issues receiving proper vegetarian meals and Adderall dosages.","SBF using fish as currency in prison for a haircut is WILD\u2026","Talk about macro to mackerel.","\u2014 Crypto Banter (@crypto_banter) November 24, 2023","","Sam Bankman-Fried now receives regular vegetarian options and his required medications, sources told the WSJ. Inmates at the facility do not eat in a communal cafeteria but instead have meals delivered to their housing units. Many prisoners prefer to buy food, clothes, and personal items from the jail\u2019s commissary, where Bankman-Fried\u2019s staple currency mackerel currently retails for $1.30 per pouch.","SBF shares his unit with other high-profile detainees awaiting trial, including Mexican former security chief Genaro Garcia Luna who stands accused of taking bribes from the Sinaloa drug cartel. Another blockmate is former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez who faces drug trafficking charges and denies any wrongdoing.","According to Hernandez\u2019s lawyer Raymond Colon, the ex-leader maintains cordial relations with Bankman-Fried as they serve out their detention. Their circumstances will shift once again after Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing when he is expected to be transferred to a federal prison to carry out his likely lengthy sentence.","Prison consultant Bill Baroni, who served time for his role in the Bridgegate political retaliation scandal, noted that Bankman-Fried will gain more freedoms and access to programming in the federal prison system. He will have to continue relying on mackerel as his monetary medium, however.","\u201CThe mack currency system is far more stable than crypto,\u201D Baroni stated, having used fish fillets to pay for his own haircuts while incarcerated. For now, Bankman-Fried seems to be adapting as best he can to his new reality behind bars."],"entity":[{"type":"November 24, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mark Botnick","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"WSJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mackerel\nMackerel 🐟 Mackerel\n🐟 🐟\nMackerel🐟 SBF 🐟Mackerel\n🐟 🐟\nMackerel 🐟 Mackerel\nMackerel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$35 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Hernandez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.30","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Genaro Garcia Luna","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sinaloa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Raymond Colon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Moni 🧙\u200D♂️","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bahamas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Juan Orlando Hernandez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brooklyn","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bill Baroni","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Sam Bankman-Fried"],"authors":["Trent Alan"]}
