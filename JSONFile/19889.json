The survey was carried out between June 30 and July 19.","The report indicates that some 59% of the Network anticipates a more severe regulatory approach that will be the principal medium- to long-term effect of this year\u2019s price falls in the crypto market. ","What do you think will be the biggest medium to long-term impacts of the recent falls in crypto prices?","Despite these forecasts, the industry\u2019s belief in bitcoin and the crypto\u2019s potential to return to its top price level seems to be unshaken by this year\u2019s market downturn, according to Acuiti\u2019s report.","\u201C84% of the network believes Bitcoin will rise back above USD 65,000, but opinion ranges on how long it will take to do this,\u201D the company said.","Will BTC go back above USD 65,000? ","Meanwhile, a third of the Network said that BTC will go as low as USD 15,000, said the report, noting that the survey was completed before the recovery in prices in early August."," What do you think will be the lowest point BTC reaches this year? ","At the same time, 50% of the Network said that the market will be moving closer to the world\u2019s traditional finance institutions, and 58% of the surveyed industry representatives said they expect banks will start to play a significant role in permissioned decentralized finance (DeFi). But only 3% said this would happen in pure DeFI, however. ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin Price Rally Failed to Attract Active Users, Exchange Flows Reveals \u2018Lackluster\u2019 Demand \u2013 Glassnode\n\u2013 Crypto Market Regains Ground Ahead of Key US Jackson Hole Meeting\n\n\u2013 Canadian Exchanges\u2019 Cap on Annual Purchases Excludes Only Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash\n\u2013 10 Traditional Companies that are Moving into Crypto Despite Market Downturn\n\n\u2013 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD 30,000 Barrier Soon\n\u2013 Bitcoin Could Fall to USD 13.6K This Year, Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again"],"entity":[{"type":"June 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"third quarter of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Derivatives Management Insight","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crypto Market Regains Ground Ahead of Key US Jackson Hole Meeting","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"84%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"58%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Acuiti Crypto Derivatives Expert Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin Price Rally Failed to Attract Active Users","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Despite Market Downturn\n\n\u2013 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","DeFi","Forecast","Market","Regulation"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
