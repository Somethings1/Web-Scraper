And Russian companies, trading with colleagues from other countries, unfortunately, are also limited in their capacities to [use crypto]. But, I think that this will change by the end of this year and the first half of next year.\u201D","Tkachev added that crypto adoption of this sort would likely continue in the short term, as will the use of Central Bank-powered alternatives. He concluded:","\u201CExpect to read headlines about a [Russian] state corporation or a state-run company becoming the first to conduct an international transaction with an overseas partner using cryptocurrency or the digital ruble.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Communications","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State Duma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tkachev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the Industrial Mining Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anton Tkachev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Centre of Economic Classifications","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FSB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moscow","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"State Duma\u2019s Committee on Information Policy, Information Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 30, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Parliamentary Gazette","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Mining","Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
