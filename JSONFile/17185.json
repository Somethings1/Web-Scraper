The G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets, endorsed in October, stemmed from the G20 New Delhi Leaders\u2019 Declaration passed in July.","A Synthesis Paper jointly developed by the FSB and the International Monetary Fund introduced the roadmap. The FSB said it would issue a progress report on the roadmap\u2019s implementation in October.\n","The Financial Stability Board is also looking to propose a standardized format for incident reporting by facilitating the simultaneous sharing of incident reports among various financial institutions and agencies, Knot said.","\u201CAccelerating digitalisation across all parts of finance has improved efficiencies but also increased the interconnectedness of the global financial system,\u201D the letter said. \u201CThis increases the possibility of a cyber or operational incident at one financial institution having spillover effects across borders and sectors.\u201D","Knot also noted in the letter that the Financial Stability Board would seek to address Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer issues as part of its efforts on cross-border payments.","The G20 brings together 19 countries along with the European Union and the African Union.
