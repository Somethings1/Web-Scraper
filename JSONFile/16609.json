Ray III is pushing back against his disgraced predecessor Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s claims that customers lost \u201Czero\u201D money in the exchange\u2019s 2022 collapse, calling them \u201Ccategorically, callously, and demonstrably false.\u201D","In a victim impact statement penned by Ray on behalf of FTX and its subsidiaries, Ray told New York District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan that Bankman-Fried\u2019s \u201Cdelusional\u201D claims that his exchange was solvent are a \u201Cmischaracterization\u201D of the estate\u2019s January statement that they expect to pay customers back in full.","Bankman-Fried and his legal team have leaned heavily on the estate\u2019s recovery, arguing in his February sentencing submission that the \u201Charm to customers, lenders, and investors is zero\u201D and, as such, Judge Kaplan should consider a maximum sentence of 6.5 years in prison \u2013 far less than the 40-50 year sentence recommended by prosecutors or the 100 year sentence suggested by the probation department.","But just because the FTX estate was able to scrape together enough money to pay back the exchange\u2019s customers \u2013 massively aided by the run-up in bitcoin\u2019s price as well as the \u201Ctens of thousands of hours\u2026spent digging through the rubble of Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s sprawling criminal enterprise to unearth every possible dollar, token, or other asset\u201D \u2013 does not mean that Bankman-Fried\u2019s behavior was not criminal, Ray argued.","Ray told the court that, when he took over, the exchange\u2019s coffers were nearly empty \u2013 a mere 105 bitcoins remained on the platform, compared with the nearly 100,000 bitcoins customers were entitled to.","Some of the lost assets were recovered, Ray said, while others, including bribes to Chinese officials and the \u201Chundreds of millions of dollars\u201D Bankman-Fried spent on various investments or buying access to celebrities and politicians are gone for good.","\u201CThe harm was vast. The remorse is nonexistent,\u201D Ray wrote in the Wednesday court filing. \u201CEffective altruism, at least as lived by Sam Bankman-Fried, was a lie.\u201D","Ray told the court that, despite the current plan to get their money back, many of FTX\u2019s customers remain \u201Cextremely unhappy\u201D with the valuation of their funds.","Because customers will be refunded based on the value of their portfolios at the time of the bankruptcy \u2013 not today\u2019s much higher value \u2013 they will \u201Cnever be returned to the same economic position they would have been in today absent [Bankman-Fried\u2019s] colossal fraud,\u201D Ray argued.","In their own victim impact statements filed earlier this week, dozens of FTX customers detailed the emotional and financial toll the exchange\u2019s collapse had on their personal lives.","\u201CThere should be no delusion that because assets have increased in value or that the professionals have been able to recover funds and assets taken or stolen from the estate, that there was no need [to file for bankruptcy],\u201D Ray wrote. \u201CMake no mistake; customers, non-governmental creditors, governmental creditors, and non-insider stockholders have suffered and continue to suffer.\u201D","Bankman-Fried is scheduled to be sentenced on March 28.","Edited by Danny Nelson."],"entity":[{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ray","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201Chundreds of millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"50","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Danny Nelson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"John J.
