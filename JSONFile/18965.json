I cannot stand him.\u201D","During a hearing on March 18, presided over by Judge Sean H. Lane, legal representatives for the creditors, Genesis, and Gemini argued against Silbert\u2019s viewpoint, advocating for a more equitable valuation of digital assets akin to unique collectibles.¬†","Brian Rosen, representing Genesis, drew an analogy to rare baseball cards, arguing for the full value of the assets rather than a diminished valuation.¬†","However, DCG\u2019s attorneys, including Jessica Liou, countered by labeling the victims\u2019 arguments as unsupported by bankruptcy law, warning that any decision favoring the victims might be overturned on appeal, further delaying restitution.","The ongoing legal battle also contains¬†a lawsuit by the New York Attorney General (AG), with potential outcomes that could significantly affect Silbert\u2019s ability to retain the disputed funds.¬†","Should Silbert and DCG fail to extricate themselves from the AG\u2019s lawsuit, the state could potentially claim the funds for restitution.","The crypto community awaits a decision in April."],"entity":[{"type":"Enron","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York Magazine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York Attorney General (AG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eric Asquith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Barry Trade","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Asquith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tyler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"GUSD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brian Rosen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NYAG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1,052,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sean H.
