He argued that to own a home and live comfortably, saving is not enough. One must learn to invest.","\u201CGreat investors are open-minded and understand things before other people,\u201D he said.","\u201CSo I know this might feel polarizing, but I encourage you to keep an open mind right now. I see Bitcoin as a very misunderstood asset class.\u201D","The audience, however, did not react well, and some even booed him.","Pan sighed and continued, saying that BTC is decentralized and finite.","He also argued that crypto exchanges \u201Cpreviously\u201D had security issues but that this was \u201Cresolved\u201D with the recent launch of the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).","Anyone can hold these funds in their retirement account, he said, proceeding to do a \u201Cdemo.\u201D Granted, \u201Cthe magic tick\u201D failed to have the desired effect.","","","A week ago, on his LinkedIn profile, Pan wrote that he was actually high when writing a speech.","He drank ayahuasca, a plant-based psychedelic that affects the senses, altering a person\u2019s thinking, sense of time, and emotions, as the Alcohol and Drug Foundation explains.","It has been long used by First Nations peoples from contemporary Peru, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador for religious ritual and therapeutic purposes.","Pan wrote in his post that he:","\u201CGot some help from AI (Ayahuasca Intelligence) this week to write my commencement speech for 60k grads and family members at Ohio State University next Sunday. We are in challenging times \u2013 wanted something extra heartfelt. (Tried chatGPT but wasn\u2019t that good).\u201D","And while many in the industry would not see much wrong with his BTC part of the speech, taken in totality, it left a lot to be desired.","Alumni, parents, peers, graduates, and others heavily criticized Pan in the post\u2019s comments.","They said that they were highly disappointed and that the scattered speech sounded like an ad for crypto and Pan\u2019s business.","One person did like it, though, arguing that people will eventually recognize that Pan \u201Cwas actually giving the best and most valuable advice to the OSU students [\u2026] as Bitcoin is the hope and future for human being.\u201D","Meanwhile, the university\u2019s website describes Pan as a social entrepreneur, musician, and inspirational speaker.","Pan graduated from Ohio State in 1999. He worked for PepsiCo and Facebook, and then he founded his bracelet-making company, MyIntent.","It also noted that Pan\u2019s umbrella organization, SpiritLab, \u201Cpromotes spiritual health and growth through experimentation.\u201D","You can watch the full Bitcoin part of the speech below (minutes 5-8):","https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lcH-iL_FdYo"],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ohio State","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ohio State University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Peru","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"OSU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brazil","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"PepsiCo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ohio","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"First Nations","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ayahuasca","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1999","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Colombia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ecuador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chris Pan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ayahuasca","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Columbus","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Drug Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Education"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
