Even during extreme volatility in Bitcoin prices, Bitcoin Depot\u2019s revenues remained steady and unaffected. For instance, while Bitcoin soared by 155% in 2023, the company\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth was a modest 6%, showcasing its resilience to market turbulence.","This resilience stems from Bitcoin Depot\u2019s strategic approach to its services, which are predominantly used for non-speculative purposes such as money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases, as indicated by user surveys conducted by the company. Unlike some entities heavily involved in cryptocurrency trading or mining, Bitcoin Depot maintains a relatively low balance of Bitcoin, typically less than $0.8 million, at any given time.","Furthermore, Bitcoin Depot has taken proactive steps to minimize its exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s volatility by maintaining a relatively low balance of Bitcoin, typically less than $1 million. The company\u2019s strategy involves purchasing Bitcoin through reputable liquidity providers like Cumberland DRW or Abra rather than engaging in mining activities.","\u201CWe use a sophisticated Bitcoin management process to reduce our exposure to volatility in Bitcoin prices by maintaining a relatively low balance (typically less than $1 million) of Bitcoin at any given time,\u201D the company stated in its filing. This approach differentiates Bitcoin Depot from its competitors and helps manage principal risk effectively.","Bitcoin Depot does not act as an agent or exchange for users in its transactions. Instead, it maintains Bitcoin balances to fulfill user demand from kiosk or BDCheckout transactions. As users receive Bitcoin, the company replenishes its balance through purchases from leading liquidity providers.","The working capital required for Bitcoin Depot\u2019s operations comprises Bitcoin held in hot wallets to fulfill user orders and cash accumulated in Bitcoin ATM kiosks. As of December 31, 2023, cash in the BTM kiosks represented approximately 21% of the company\u2019s average monthly revenues. This dual approach to managing Bitcoin and cash balances contributes to the stability and resilience of Bitcoin Depot\u2019s business model.","Bitcoin Depot, a prominent player in the Bitcoin ATM (BTM) industry, has solidified its position as the largest cryptocurrency ATM operator globally. Founded in 2016, Bitcoin Depot operates a vast network of over 7,000 BTMs worldwide, allowing users to conveniently deposit and withdraw money using cash or a debit card.","In comparison, its main competitors, CoinFlip and BitStop, operate 4,800 and 2,500 machines, respectively, according to data from CoinATMRadar as of April 2024.","Despite Bitcoin Depot\u2019s success, the overall trend in the Bitcoin ATM market witnessed a decline in installations for the first time in a decade in 2023. Coin ATM Radar data shows an 11% decrease in installed Bitcoin ATMs globally, dropping from 37,827 on January 1, 2023, to 33,622 on the same date in 2024.","This decline was particularly notable in the United States, which accounts for 82% of all Bitcoin ATMs globally. The number of Bitcoin ATMs in the US decreased from 32,672 to 27,621 throughout 2023, marking the first year-over-year decline in installed BTMs.","Bitcoin Depot\u2019s CEO, Brandon Mintz, remains optimistic about the ATM industry\u2019s future. He anticipates a significant rebound following the much-awaited Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to occur soon. The Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks in the Bitcoin network, is often associated with increased market activity and interest in cryptocurrencies."],"entity":[{"type":"April 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 1, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"82%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"December 31, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Depot","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brandon Mintz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin ATM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$689 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"21%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$0.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"11%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"155%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$647 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ATM","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin ATM","Bitcoin Depot"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
