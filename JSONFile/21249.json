He evangelizes gold-buying as an investment strategy, but claims that BTC is a scam. He has also positioned himself as a broadcaster in recent years, launching a self-titled podcast.","Per the Associated Press, Schiff\u2019s Puerto Rican banking outfit, Euro Pacific International Bank, was granted an operating permit in 2017, but has since run into trouble after deposits dropped to the USD 150 million mark.","Two years ago, the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement, a government-run anti-tax crime and money laundering unit, stepped in \u201Cto put a stop to the suspected facilitation of offshore tax evasion and money laundering,\u201D the same media outlet reported.","Schiff claimed that his bank had never been probed and claimed that the only brush he had had with the body was when \u201Cagents with the Internal Revenue Service visited the bank in 2020 and told him they were investigating customers.\u201D","Schiff claimed last week that he would fight to save his ailing business. The bank account closure appears to be linked to these firefighting efforts.","He complained, also on Twitter:","\u201CIt costs a fortune to run a small bank. That\u2019s why I never really made any money. The compliance costs are outrageous.\u201D","Some bitcoiners replied by simply expressing their mirth, while others quipped:","\u201CBitcoin fixes this.\u201D","One explained:","\u201CRegulators can\u2019t close, shut down, or freeze your bitcoin.\u201D","In addition to a large amount of LOL emojis and memes, there were also a few more level-headed responses.","The Managing Director of Swan Bitcoin International Stephan Livera wrote:","\u201CIn fairness, bitcoin companies and bitcoiners can also easily have their fiat bank accounts shut down. But for him to completely deny the value of bitcoin at times like this is just burying your head in the sand.\u201D","In a recent BTC-themed Twitter tirade, Schiff claimed that because bitcoin \u201Cwhales\u201D had \u201Csucceeded in pumping\u201D the coin \u201Cclose to USD 70,000, it was now \u201Cmuch easier for them to unload more worthless bitcoin at USD 20,000, as those suckers who are buying think they\u2019re getting a bargain.\u201D","He added:","\u201CThese \u2018bargain\u2019 hunters averaging down will eventually be known as bag holders.\u201D","Acid words such as these have alienated many bitcoiners, although many in the space simply regard Schiff as a harmless and sometimes amusing eccentric.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 G7 Inadvertently Makes the Case for Bitcoin with New Gold Move\n\u2013 The Words We Use In Bitcoin: Words, Language, Terminology, and Linguistic Attacks\n\n\u2013 Following MicroStrategy, El Salvador\u2019s Bukele Buys Another Bitcoin Dip Too, Skeptics Chime In\n\u2013 How Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Launched Another \u2018Proof of Keys\u2019 Day\n\n\u2013 Buffet\u2019s Gold Investment Triggers Schiff\u2019s Attack on Bitcoin\n\u2013 Peter Shiff\u2019s \u2018Lost\u2019 Bitcoin \u2018Mystery is Solved\u2019!"],"entity":[{"type":"Associated Press","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"150 million mark","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Swan Bitcoin International Stephan Livera","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Euro Pacific Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Internal Revenue Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peter Schiff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Peter Shiff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Euro Pacific International Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terminology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Puerto Rican","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gold Investment Triggers Schiff\u2019s Attack","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Schiff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador\u2019s Bukele Buys Another Bitcoin Dip Too","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Banking","Bitcoin"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
