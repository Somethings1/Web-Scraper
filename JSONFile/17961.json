He is now seeking legal recourse.","BATTLING SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION EVERYWHERE: @SenWarren, I advocate for strong US crypto regulations. PLEASE go after the bad actors in our space. But the DOJ, SEC, & FBI prosecuted me for 3 1\/2 years for a crime THEY fabricated.

Nerayoff takes issue with how the project took shape and has objections over particular actions by specific leaders, however, he said.","While the validity of Nerayoff\u2019s claims is still unconfirmed, Scotto said the forthcoming lawsuits will likely include charges of malicious prosecution and breach of contract over hundreds of millions in unpaid deals and that the whistleblower fillings will relate specifically to ETHGate.","As was seen in the recording Nerayoff published last week, he provided key strategic guidance to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2015 on tackling mounting structural, legal, and financial problems.","An X post on November 15 from Nerayoff also hinted at the possibility of fraud being in the mix of allegations that will be revealed in the lawsuits.","\u201CThe recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,\u201D he wrote in the post.","The recording isn\u2019t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening & show my involvement.","The fraud will be in the lawsuit.","48-Hour Countdown: Ethereum Insider's Shocking Fraud Expose Looms \u2013 Crypto News Flash https:\/\/t.co\/uvD6PjfcVJ","\u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023","","Though recognizing the need for change, Buterin seemed reluctant to make necessary choices in the recording. A restructuring plan was also proposed but never fully implemented.","Scotto explained that his client was focused entirely on defending himself after the September 2019 arrest until finally getting the government to dismiss charges. According to Scotto, Nerayoff felt fighting for his life and reputation against wrongful allegations took priority over releasing the recordings of himself and Buterin earlier.","\u201CIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say [he was] fighting for his life, and frankly we were only able to go on the offensive this past February when we filed our motion to dismiss,\u201D Scotto said. \u201CThe case was eventually dismissed on the government\u2019s motion because our motion proved they knew he was innocent and charged him anyway, and they ignored that evidence and simply said \u2018Oh yeah, we can\u2019t prove his guilt.'\u201D","Now exonerated, Steven Nerayoff is going on the offense against parties he believes took advantage of the situation. Scotto said Nerayoff sat in court for years until he could fully clear his name.","\u201CThe idea was to kind of coordinate those (the recordings and lawsuits)\u2026 And so that\u2019s coming shortly,\u201D Scotto told Cryptonews.com. \u201C\u2026The idea was we would put this out there because when those lawsuits became public, we didn\u2019t want people to then question who Steve was and what happened.\u201D","Steve was innocent and we had the evidence to show the case was fabricated and his alleged co-conspirator was a govt informant. @JohnEDeaton1 commented on the dismissal. https:\/\/t.co\/Tg5ToWsooN look to the east soon.","\u2014 michael scotto (@mascotto89) November 17, 2023","","Scotto said that the dismissal of charges against Nerayoff followed revelations that government officials knew he was innocent at least seven months prior to arresting him, and that his alleged co-conspirator was an FBI informant who conned Nerayoff out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.","Scotto said the facts would illuminate \u201Ccoincidences between certain events that were going on at the SEC and steps that were being taken\u201D against Nerayoff. He said one aspect of the lawsuits would deal with \u201Cmalicious prosecution.\u201D","\u201CThat\u2019s a big one,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd then a couple of breach of contract cases on some of these deals that people basically either took advantage of the situation or [were] a part of creating the situation in order to stiff Steve of literally hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201D","Scotto said the full sequence of events will make clear that the malicious prosecution occurred.","Soooo..given the news about Consensys, JPM , law suits and probable links to the SEC\u2026can we conclude that Ethereum IS a centralised, bankers shit coin ?\u2026 Answers on a post card to @GaryGensler and the @SECGov and it was projection onto #XRP all along #XRPArmy #XRPCommunity","\u2014 MADDOG (@PMADDOGMAC) March 5, 2022","","Within the next few weeks, Nerayoff is planning to release the Ethereum whistleblower filings and file the malicious prosecution lawsuit, according to Scotto, who maintained they have ample evidence to back claims of hundreds of millions in damages from broken deals.","Ethereum leaders have so far been publicly silent amid the bold accusations of shady activities. Scottor said he finds this lack of denial telling given the nature of the allegations.","He added that Nerayoff\u2019s frustrations also stem from parts of the crypto media declining to cover his exoneration and the questionable circumstances around it. He ultimately released the collection of five Buterin recordings directly on the blockchain\u2014decentralizing it\u2014to get the story out.","If true, these latest allegations may present a crisis moment for Ethereum as doubts multiply regarding its origins and Buterin\u2019s leadership. With the platform aspiring to be a Web3 backbone, this controversy could deepen existing concerns over stagnant Ether prices and developer frustrations.","\u201CIt\u2019s up to other people to decide, but I think people will be able to judge based on these objective facts and conclusions that they can draw based on those facts,\u201D Scotto said."],"entity":[{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Federal Courts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nerayoff\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nerayoff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York State","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nerayoff","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Scotto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 16, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Steve","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 5, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 17, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"michael scotto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Scotto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Government","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto News Flash https:\/\/t.co\/uvD6PjfcVJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steven Nerayoff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 22, 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Fraud","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Trent Alan"]}
