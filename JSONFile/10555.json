The Department says the exchange failed to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program and failed to have \"reasonable procedures\" in place to confirm customers' identities and also failed to file suspicious activity reports. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The indictment said that KuCoin deliberately avoided U.S. AML and KYC regulations by \"falsely representing that it had no U.S. customers when, in truth, KuCoin had a substantial U.S. customer base.\"&nbsp;The government claims KuCoin allowed its platform to be used for laundering over $9 billion.<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Indeed, KuCoin allegedly took advantage of its sizeable U.S. customer base to become one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency derivatives and spot exchanges, with billions of dollars of daily trades and trillions of dollars of annual trade volume,\" <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-sdny\/pr\/prominent-global-cryptocurrency-exchange-kucoin-and-two-its-founders-criminally\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/span><\/a>. \"<\/span><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But financial institutions like KuCoin that take advantage of the unique opportunities available in the United States must also comply with U.S. law to help identify and drive out crime and corrupt financing schemes.&nbsp; KuCoin allegedly deliberately chose not to do so.\"<\/span>","The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed a parallel civil action on Tuesday against KuCoin, the DOJ said.&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KuCoin directed The Block to its posts on X.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"#KuCoin<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is operating well, and the assets of our users are absolutely safe,\" the exchange said. \"We are aware of the related reports&nbsp; and are currently investigating the details through our lawyers. KuCoin respect the laws and regulations of various countries and strictly adheres to compliance standards.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a post on X, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu said he was aware of the charges but that the exchange has not been affected.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"While we\u2019re working on it, the platform is unaffected and operating normally as usual,\" Lyu said. \"Your assets are safe and sound with us. Our team and I will provide timely updates about the progress.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The DOJ said the founders, Gan and Tang, remain at large. The charges against Gan and Tang \u2014 conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business \u2014 each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Overall, KuCoin allegedly never filed required suspicious activity reports, did not register with the CFTC, and through the end of 2023 never registered as a money transmitting business, as required. The exchange's actions caused KuCoin to receive over $5 billion and send over $4 billion of \"suspicious and criminal funds,\" the DOJ said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Crypto exchanges like KuCoin cannot have it both ways.&nbsp; Today\u2019s Indictment should send a clear message to other crypto exchanges: if you plan to serve U.S. customers, you must follow U.S. law, plain and simple,\" Attorney General Williams said.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Until at least July 2023, KuCoin didn't require customers to provide identifying information. After July, when KuCoin was notified of its activities, then KuCoin adopted the KYC program for new customers, though that didn't apply to existing customers, the DOJ said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KuCoin is a large exchange with about 30 million customers in 207 countries and a daily spot trading volume of over $2.8 billion, according to the indictment. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This marks KuCoin's second run-in with the law.

At one point, KuCoin also lied to at least one investor about where its customers were located and said it had no U.S. customers, the government alleges.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Despite the fact that KuCoin gathered and tracked location information for its customers, KuCoin actively prevented its U.S. customers from identifying themselves as such when opening KuCoin accounts,\" the DOJ said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Since KuCoin did not implement the necessary AML and Know Your Customer programs, the exchange opened itself up to money laundering, according to the indictment.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, from August 2022 to November 2023, about 197 KuCoin deposit addresses indirectly or directly received $3.2 million worth of crypto from virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash, which has been placed on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247049\/tornado-cashs-semenov-added-to-us-government-sanctions-list\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sanctions<\/span><\/a> list, the DOJ said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Also, from at least 2020 to 2022, the exchange was used to launder proceeds from a fraud scheme where millions of dollars were stolen from U.S. banks and other crypto exchanges.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tuesday's crackdown on KuCoin marks the second time U.S. prosecutors have charged crypto exchanges with failing to maintain a solid AML program. In November 2023, crypto exchange Binance pleaded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264013\/binance-us-press-conference-settlement\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">guilty<\/span><\/a> and agreed to pay $4 billion. The exchange's former CEO, Changpeng Zhao,&nbsp;is currently awaiting sentencing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KuCoin illegally operated a digital asset derivatives exchange, the CFTC said in its complaint filed on Tuesday.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFor too long, some offshore crypto exchanges have followed a now-familiar playbook by offering derivative products and falsely claiming people in the United States cannot use their platforms, when in reality, anyone in the U.S. with commonly used technology can trade without providing basic customer identifying information,\u201D said the CFTC's Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley, in a statement.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The CFTC said in its complaint that KuCoin did not have KYC procedures from July 2019 to June 2023, though the exchange claimed it did.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About 20 to 50 percent of KuCoin's customers were based in the U.S., and thus within the agency's authority, requiring registration, but that did not happen, the CFTC said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Although KuCoin purported to implement KYC procedures on or around November 1, 2018, those procedures were a sham and did not actually prevent U.S. customers from trading commodity interests and other derivatives on the platform. Instead, KuCoin\u2019s KYC procedures were completely optional during the Relevant Period, and KuCoin encouraged U.S. customers to avoid them,\" the CFTC said in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/PressRoom\/PressReleases\/8884-24\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complaint<\/span><\/a>.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The CFTC said KuCoin also marketed to U.S. investors, citing influencer campaigns and industry conferences, including Consensus 2022 and Mainnet 2022.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The CFTC is seeking disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans as well as a permanent injunction against future violations.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update<\/i><\/b><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> (March 26, 5:22 p.m. UTC): Added details throughout.<\/i><\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
