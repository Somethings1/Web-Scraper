Its price is very affordable for the general consumer, but the only issue is how Binance as a company does\u2026,\u201D Desmond Marshall, Managing Director of investment advisory firm Rouge International, was quoted as saying.","Among those most bullish on BNB over the long-term was John Stefanidis, CEO of the NFT gaming company Balthazar, who said BNB could reach USD 3,000 by 2030.","\u201C[\u2026] having complied with regulation globally, it\u2019s set up for long term success. Great [user experience], strong ventures team, excellent brand,\u201D Stefanidis summarized Binance\u2019s strengths as a company.","Despite being optimistic about the price this year, one panelist also warned about a lack of decentralization behind BNB, given that it has always been associated with the centralized exchange Binance.","\u201CBinance\u2019s association with [BNB Chain]\/BNB may lead people to question just how decentralized it is; however, the bright side is that the exchange can use its platform and name recognition to recruit the world\u2019s best developers to create their projects on [the BNB Chain],\u201D Daniel Polotsky, Founder of the crypto ATM provider CoinFlip was quoted as saying.","Overall, few of the panelists said BNB would be the best altcoin to hold in 2022. Out of all 14 respondents, only 7% said BNB would be this year\u2019s best performer. Instead of BNB, 21% of the panellists favoured polkadot (DOT), followed by 14% that preferred terra (LUNA) and 10% who said cardano (ADA) would be the top altcoin.","At the time of writing (16:00 UTC), BNB, ranked 4th by market capitalization, traded at USD 397, up 4% over the past 24 hours but down 3% over the past 7 days. The price is up over 60% in a year.\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Binance Joins Russian Banking Union, Will Head New Crypto Department\n\u2013 Binance Invests USD 200M in Forbes\n\n\u2013 Crypto Exchanges are Top Consumers of Bitcoin Block Space, Binance No 1\n\u2013 \u2018Russian Ethereum\u2019, Waves, Almost Triples Since Ukraine War Began\n\n\u2013 ETH Rises with Broader Market as Ethereum Fees Hit a 7-Month Low\n\u2013 Bitcoin Rally Gets Support From \u2018Watershed\u2019 Executive Order, Rising Stock Market"],"entity":[{"type":"Broader Market","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Top Consumers of Bitcoin Block Space","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2030","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Balthazar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Stefanidis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Forbes\n\n\u2013 Crypto Exchanges","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"21%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Almost Triples Since Ukraine War Began","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rouge International","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Will Head New Crypto Department\n\u2013 Binance Invests USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Desmond Marshall","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"14%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Daniel Polotsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"John Stefanidis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance Joins Russian Banking Union","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Binance","BNB","Forecast","Survey"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
