The potential benefits of blockchain, including greater speed and transparency, as well as lower costs, are driving these initiatives.","Just recently, European banks SEB and Crédit Agricole launched so|bond, a new blockchain-based platform for issuing digital bonds in the traditional financial sector.","The new platform aims to improve efficiency and enable real-time data synchronization across participants, similar to what Canton Network aspires to achieve. "," "],"entity":[{"type":"Deutsche Börse Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DRW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Canton Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Dollar Project","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Capgemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EquiLend","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cboe Global Markets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chris Zuehlke","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Digital Asset","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Umbrage","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"VERT Capita","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Global Head of Cumberland","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Microsoft","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The Canton Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Versana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Deloitte","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNP Paribas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Canton Network","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Goldman Sachs","Microsoft"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
