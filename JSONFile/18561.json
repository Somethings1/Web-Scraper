These financial products enhanced the accessibility of cryptocurrency for the public, providing new investment options.","The SEC first postponed its decision on allowing options trading for Bitcoin ETFs in March 2024. The delay affected proposals from both Cboe Exchange Inc. and Nasdaq ISE, which sought to offer options linked to ETFs holding Bitcoin and BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, respectively.","Details of these postponements were documented in the SEC\u2019s announcements, demonstrating the regulator\u2019s cautious approach to overseeing the expansion of crypto-related products.","These proposals aimed to introduce derivatives that traders could use to speculate on future gains or to protect against potential losses.","By paying a premium, an investor can enter into a contract with another party, typically facilitated by an exchange, that sets a future date at which the investor has the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specific asset, such spot Bitcoin ETFs, at a predetermined price regardless of the market price at that time."],"entity":[{"type":"Bitwise\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitwise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York Stock Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 29, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cboe Exchange Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq ISE","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Grayscale","SEC"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
