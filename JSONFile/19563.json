Its exchange is for institutional traders and \u201Coperates as a level playing field trading venue.\u201D","In most markets, exchanges match buyers with sellers at the most competitive, transparent price. ","However, laws surrounding market-making and proprietary trading require that they be conducted by separate private companies in order to avoid conflicts of interest. ","Crypto.com\u2019s proprietary trading team has the sole goal of making money \u201Cand not facilitating an exchange.\u201D ","The market-making desk, however, is tasked with boosting liquidity on the venue, the people familiar with the matter said. ","They added that the proprietary trading desk trades both on the company\u2019s own exchange and other platforms. ","Crypto.com reportedly told the FT that \u201Call companies operating in the trading industry compare volumes to their competitors.\u201D ","It added that the priority was to \u201Ccontinuously improve order book liquidity and lowering spreads as it results in a more efficient market for all participants.\u201D","The company stated that \u201Cparticipants on the platform, including market makers, are treated equally\u201D and that the company \u201Cdoes not rely on proprietary trading as a source of revenue\u201D.","The new revelations about potential conflicts of interest in Crypto.com come as the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators have long warned users about the dangers of manipulation in the industry. ","In fact, the SEC has hit Binance, the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, with 13 charges, including using a trading firm owned by CEO Changpeng Zhao to engage in \u201Cmanipulative trading that artificially inflated the platform\u2019s trading volume.\u201D","The commission even requested an asset freeze for Binance.US, claiming that Binance improperly moved billions of dollars of customer funds to a bank account for an entity controlled by Zhao. ","However, the agency and Binance.US have recently agreed on a compromise that avoids the freezing of the exchange\u2019s assets."],"entity":[{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Exchange","Crypto.com"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
