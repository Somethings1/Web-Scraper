Please cheer for us.\u201D¬†","Interestingly, Achi\u2019s owner had previously attempted to work with Solana users, but the experience turned sour.¬†","Following the success of WIF, another meme coin called ACHI emerged with the support and endorsement of Achi\u2019s parents.¬†","However, the creators of ACHI allegedly abandoned the project shortly after its launch, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of Achi\u2019s parents.¬†","Consequently, they decided to collaborate with Feisty DAO, a proven entity in the NFT space, to ensure a smoother and more secure auction process.","While some members of the WIF community expressed frustration over the lack of coordination between Achi\u2019s parents and the meme coin community, it appears that little effort was made by the community to establish contact with the family behind the dog that propelled their token to a multi-billion dollar valuation.¬†","Despite the astronomical success of WIF, Achi\u2019s parents claimed to have never heard from anyone in the WIF community until recently when they attempted to reach out.","Mihir, a member of the WIF community involved in the fundraising campaign to display Achi\u2019s face on the LED screen-covered Sphere arena in Las Vegas, admitted that he was unaware of Achi\u2019s owners until last week.¬†","However, he acknowledged that they deserved recognition and some share of the spoils generated by WIF, which currently boasts a market capitalization exceeding $3 billion.¬†","hi im owner of this dog. Can you contact me?","\u2014 achichu (@achichuchu) February 4, 2024","","Path, the Feisty DAO member overseeing the NFT auction, expressed openness to the idea of re-minting the NFT on Solana if there was interest from the Solana community.¬†","He even reached out to Ansem, a prominent member of the WIF community, to gauge their interest in purchasing the Achi NFT, but received no positive response.¬†","¬†"],"entity":[{"type":"Ethereum NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Achi","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Las Vegas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mihir","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$182,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Feisty DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 4, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Achi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Achi NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"WIF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["DogWifHat","Meme Coins"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
