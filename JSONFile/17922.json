While the Bitcoin network has primarily been used for payment transactions, current activity appears to be resembling that of Ethereum during the height of decentralized application (Dapp) projects.Â ","The introduction of Bitcoin Runes and BRC-20 tokensÂ  \u2013 which emerged during the time of the fourth Bitcoin halving event \u2013 has likely sparked the evolution of Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi).","Rena Shah, VP of Products at Trust Machines \u2013 a team focused on growing the Bitcoin economy \u2013 told Cryptonews that two years ago, Bitcoin DeFi wasn\u2019t a narrative the ecosystem was discussing.Â ","Yet Shah noted that the emergence of staking platforms and lending protocols across the Bitcoin network has created interest among investors in transitioning assets from a store of value to a source of value.Â ","Growth in the Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFI) ecosystem is staggering ðŸ§¡","ðŸŸ§ @ALEXLabBTC leading the charge, with @Bitflow_Finance & @StackingDao following.","\u2013 Data from @signal21btc pic.twitter.com\/87MP5hMCbL","\u2014 stacks.btc (@Stacks) May 8, 2024","","\u201CThe desire to go from a passive to a productive Bitcoin asset is real in 2024,\u201D she said. \u201CWe have been building towards this future because we can see that Bitcoin DeFi is appealing not just to retail investors but also to institutional investors.\u201D","Data from DeFiLlama shows that Bitcoin\u2019s total value locked (TVL) is roughly $1.2 billion. Yet, according to Shah, nearly $1 trillion in capital is locked on the Bitcoin blockchain.","\u201CEven the smallest percentages of capital becoming productive in DeFi will make huge waves in the Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201D Shah pointed out.Â ","This, along with the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, is increasing the potential for Bitcoin DeFi applications. In particular, this will likely appeal to institutions holding Bitcoin and retail investors.Â ","","Tycho Onnasch, the co-founder of Zest Protocol, told Cryptonews that he believes BTC is a more institutional asset than the rest of crypto.Â ","\u201CHence, I expect institutions to play a larger part in using and bootstrapping Bitcoin DeFi,\u201D said Onnasch.Â ","Although Bitcoin DeFi is still a relatively new concept, a number of projects seek to enable and advance the sector.","For example, Onnasch explained that Zest Protocol is creating a lending protocol built specifically for Bitcoin. He mentioned that the goal behind the platform is to create a permissionless financial infrastructure for BTC lending markets.","\u201CZest enables users to collateralize BTC to borrow other tokens such as stablecoins,\u201D he said. \u201CThe platform also lets users earn yield on their BTC.\u201DÂ ","Indeed, the primary use case behind Bitcoin DeFi applications seems to be ensuring that Bitcoin becomes a more productive asset for investors.","Dr. Chiente Hsu, Co-Founder of ALEX and XLink, told Cryptonews that Alex is a new finance layer for the Bitcoin network.Â ","\u201COur goal is to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin with layer-2 (L2) solutions and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) world,\u201D said Hsu. \u201CThis will allow us to expand the Bitcoin economy,\u201D said Hsu.","For instance, Hsu explained that investors can earn yield on their BTC by connecting a Bitcoin wallet to XLink. He noted that XLink is powered by ALEX\u2019s automated market maker (AMM) and decentralized exchange (DEX). This will allow cross-chain swaps between Bitcoin L2s and the EVM world.Â ","\u201CBitcoin DeFi for institutions will be the pursuit of Bitcoin yield generating assets,\u201D said Hsu.Â ","Hsu believes this will likely be the case due to the large amount of capital on the Bitcoin network.","\u201CThere\u2019s well over $1 trillion in Bitcoin capital that is \u2018idle\u2019 in the sense that its value rises and falls relative to the Bitcoin spot price,\u201D he said. \u201CBut unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin can\u2019t be natively locked to generate a yield. This is a solution that ALEX is actively pursuing, which will enable institutions that hold Bitcoin to earn yield through their Bitcoin capital.\u201D","Another interesting point is that while Bitcoin DeFi is unique, applications tend to resemble DeFi projects on Ethereum (ETH). This is important to consider, as institutions have started to show interest in many current DeFi applications.Â ","Digital asset management firm Fireblocks recently found increased institutional DeFi activity on the Fireblocks platform. According to the firm, there was a 75% jump in the first quarter of 2024.Â ","Fireblocks reported that some of the most popular Dapps that institutional customers interact with across swapping, lending, staking, and bridging include Uniswap, Aave, Curve, 1inch, and Jupiter.Â ","Jeff Yin, CEO of Merlin Chain \u2013 a Bitcoin L2 facilitating fast, cost-effective transactions with support for BTC Dapps \u2013 told Cryptonews that DEXs, derivatives, and lending are all areas where BTC has learned extensively from ETH. He added that many new protocols are emerging.Â ","\u201CFor example, \u2018Surf\u2019 is a derivatives trading protocol that launched on Merlin Chain and now boasts a daily trading volume of over $10 million. These are similar to their Ethereum counterparts,\u201D said Yin.Â ","Yin elaborated that a specific Bitcoin DeFi application would replicate one of the largest ETH DeFi protocols, Lido \u2013 which holds $28 billion and accounts for half of Ethereum\u2019s DeFi TVL.Â ","\u201CSolvBTC is currently developing an underlying BTC yield protocol,\u201D said Yin. \u201CAdditionally, Unicross has implemented a Rune trading protocol on a BTC L2, allowing users to trade Layer 1 (L1) assets more cheaply on L2. These represent the more innovative aspects of the sector.\u201DÂ ","While Bitcoin DeFi may appear similar to Ethereum, Shah believes that decentralized finance using BTC may eventually surpass Ethereum.Â ","\u201CLooking at DappRadar, Ethereum has over 600 active apps with varying volume and activity,\u201D said Shah. \u201CI have no reason to expect that Bitcoin DeFi cannot match Ethereum, and eventually flip it for Dapps in the ecosystem.\u201D","Certain solutions are also making it easier to bring Ethereum Dapps to Bitcoin.Â ","Zack Voell, Director of Marketing at Botanix Labs, told Cryptonews that Botanix had created a \u201CSpiderchain\u201D that easily enables DeFi on Bitcoin.Â ","\u201CSpiderchain creates a fully EVM-equivalent environment for Dapps and smart contracts on Ethereum to be copy-pasted to run natively on Bitcoin,\u201D said Voell. \u201CBotanix Labs is building the Spiderchain to combine the two most Lindy technologies in crypto \u2014 the EVM and Bitcoin \u2014 instead of trying to reinvent a completely new protocol or virtual machine.\u201D","Although it\u2019s too soon to determine the fate of Bitcoin DeFi, certain challenges may slow adoption.Â ","For instance, Yin pointed out that liquidity fragmentation often results from the difficulty of implementing DeFi on an L1 network. This, in turn, forces most activities to disperse across various L2 solutions, yetÂ Yin noted that this may make it difficult to concentrate liquidity.Â ","\u201CA potential solution could be to create omnichain liquidity, similar to the Stone protocol in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201D he said. \u201CWe look forward to future implementations like M-STONEBTC and Solv Protocol that could unify BTC L2 liquidity.\u201D","Additionally, Shah mentioned that Bitcoin\u2019s challenge is keeping the base layer secure, stable, and untampered.Â ","\u201CThat is where scaling becomes paramount,\u201D she said. \u201CA healthy and diverse L2 ecosystem will be what ultimately drives Bitcoin DeFi, as a vertical, to succeed.\u201D","Shah added that programming environments on Bitcoin are inherently difficult since many developers from other ecosystems are less familiar with Bitcoin script.Â ","She noted that one way to combat this is to create WebAssembly (WASM) or different run-time environments like Rust, Solidity, and Cosmos with L2s.Â ","\u201CThis approach will likely help bring new developers into the ecosystem,\u201D she remarked."],"entity":[{"type":"Chiente Hsu","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jeff Yin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VP of Products","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum\u2019s DeFi TVL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"first quarter of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Onnasch","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zack Voell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cryptonews","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DappRadar","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Merlin Chain","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"two years ago","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Aave","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Unicross","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Trust Machines","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jupiter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Botanix Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tycho Onnasch","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Zest Protocol","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC Dapps \u2013","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shah","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hsu","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum Dapps","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Director of Marketing","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin DeFi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Uniswap","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Voell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shah","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lido","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BRC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin L2s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rena Shah","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$28 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Botanix","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","DeFi","etherem"],"authors":["Rachel Wolfson"]}
