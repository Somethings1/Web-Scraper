We would not be surprised if similar transparency issues led to members of the team resigning in 2021,\u201D Woodard added, while noting that the financial value of the Aragon project should be recognized by the project\u2019s leadership.","\u201CA [token] buyback is the best course of action to achieve everyone\u2019s goals and provide all forms of value,\u201D the research analyst wrote."],"entity":[{"type":"Aragon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aragon\u2019s Discord","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aragon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex Woodard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Woodard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday this week","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["DAO"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
