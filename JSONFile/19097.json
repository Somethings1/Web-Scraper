Recently trading around $61,540, Bitcoin dipped to an intra-day low of $60,910, influenced by escalating regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and a hawkish Federal Reserve stance on interest rates.","Despite these challenges, strategic initiatives such as Hong Kong\u2019s $1 billion crypto ETF liquid fund are being introduced to bolster market stability and potentially mitigate further losses.","This fund, along with partnerships like Wintermute\u2019s collaboration with OSL and HashKey, aims to enhance liquidity for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, offering a glimmer of hope for recovery amidst prevailing market uncertainties.","","Research from 10x Research indicates that approximately $2 billion worth of tokens are scheduled for release over the next ten weeks. This influx of previously locked tokens is likely to inflate market supply and could dampen altcoin values.","As these assets enter the market, venture capitalists might sell off their holdings to capitalize on gains, thereby stifling potential upward price movements for cryptocurrencies.","This scenario could potentially usher in an extended corrective period for the crypto market.","","The strength of the U.S. dollar, bolstered by expectations that the Federal Reserve may maintain high interest rates for a prolonged period, is exerting pressure on Bitcoin prices.","This scenario is reinforced by higher U.S. Treasury yields, which support the dollar\u2019s ascent. Susan Collins of the Federal Reserve noted that reaching the 2% inflation target might slow economic growth, adding complexity to the rate outlook.","While additional rate hikes are not guaranteed, they remain possible, reflecting the Fed\u2019s cautious stance on monetary policy. This financial environment, characterized by a robust dollar and the anticipation of enduring high rates, directs investors towards more traditional assets, thus suppressing Bitcoin\u2019s value.","","Despite economic uncertainties and the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious stance, large-scale Bitcoin investors, commonly referred to as \u201Cwhales,\u201D have demonstrated significant confidence in the cryptocurrency.","Over the past day, these investors have purchased approximately $971 million worth of Bitcoin, as trading volumes generally decreased.","üê≥ As #Bitcoin ranges tightly between $61K and $64K, large whales have made some accumulation moves over the past 24 hours. Wallets with 1K-10K $BTC have collectively accumulated ~$941M worth of coins, rebounding to their highest holding level in 2 weeks. https:\/\/t.co\/NkYwRsc8Pd pic.twitter.com\/LWAt03TgUP","\u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 8, 2024","","According to data from Santiment, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have added over 15,000 BTC to their balances.","This surge in whale activity occurs even as Bitcoin\u2019s price dipped to $27,000, underscoring a robust optimistic sentiment among major stakeholders in the cryptocurrency market.","Bitcoin (BTC) today shows a modest gain, up 0.50% at $61,540, suggesting a bearish bitcoin price prediction. As BTC approaches critical technical thresholds, its market behaviour suggests cautious optimism among traders. Currently, the pivot point is set at $62,638, closely aligning with the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $62,509. This proximity indicates a potential battleground for bullish and bearish sentiments.","BTC faces immediate resistance at $64,748, with further barriers at $67,149 and $69,441. Support levels are established at $60,928, $58,927, and $56,625, marking significant fallback positions in case of price retractions.","The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 40 hints at a bearish momentum below the 50 EMA. A decisive move above this EMA could pivot to a more bullish outlook, while staying below could intensify selling pressures.","","","","99Bitcoins, a leader in digital education, is transforming the way users learn about cryptocurrency through its \u2018learn-to-earn\u2019 platform. Participants can enhance their knowledge while earning $99BTC tokens, effectively growing both their expertise and their investment portfolios.","The current presale of $99BTC tokens is catching the attention of savvy investors, offering an enticing entry price for early participants.","This presale presents a rare chance for early investors to secure $99BTC tokens at a competitive price of $0.00103 each.
