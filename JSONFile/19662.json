But he said he was left out of pocket when market prices began to tumble.","He called the $29 million investment a \u201Cbet\u201D that had gone wrong \u2013 and on Twitter labeled it \u201Cthe gamble of the century.\u201D","Misaki is known as \u201CThe Green Juice Prince\u201D in Japan. He managed to build a fortune by marketing aojiru (kale or barleygrass) juice to young female consumers. The drink is traditionally enjoyed by older Japanese people. But Misaki managed to create a business empire around the notion of selling the product as a diet aid for young women.\nÂ ","He has also built up a large social media following \u2013 and has almost a million YouTube subscribers and 1.5 million Twitter followers.","In the video, which he entitled \u201Cmental collapse,\u201D Misaki explained that he had recently made \u201Ca profit of several hundred million yen\u201D with an initial coin purchase. But he appears to have followed this up with a more extensive (and much less successful) attempt to make money on the market.","Misaki explained that he had, most recently, invested a total of around $9.6 million in crypto. But he said that his portfolio had now shrunk in worth to just $2.2 million.","The entrepreneur claimed that investing in crypto had left him \u201Ctired\u201D and \u201Cnauseous\u201D \u2013 and had severely depleted his funds.","He stated:","\u201CI was so greedy [\u2026] I don\u2019t want anyone to imitate me.\u201D","However, he claimed that he \u201Cstill\u201D held \u201Cpositions\u201D in crypto, and was hopeful of making a turnaround should the market recover to 2021 levels.","Misaki established Media Hearts in 2007 and, by the early 2010s, began turning enormous profits. But in 2019, he suffered an unexpected blow when tax authorities raided his firm over suspicions of tax evasion.","Misaki was found to have evaded paying some $1.63 million worth of taxes \u2013 and was arrested along with two company executives.","He recently released a best-selling book chronicling his meteoric rise to fame and fortune.","Followers expressed their sympathy for Misaki. One wrote on YouTube that they had also suffered \u201Cbig\u201D crypto losses, while another claimed that they \u201Cgo crazy\u201D when they begin to invest.","Others backed him to make a comeback in the business world \u2013 and urged him to leave the crypto markets for good."],"entity":[{"type":"several hundred million yen","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$9.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Media Hearts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Green Juice Prince\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$29 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Yuta Misaki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Misaki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2007","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.63 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2010s","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Japan","Social media"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
