The country held its election on Wednesday with defence minister Prabowo Subianto and ex-governors Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo all competing to become the next president.","In December, Indonesia\u2019s Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka, a vice presidential candidate in Indonesia\u2019s election, said he aims to accelerate Indonesia\u2019s position as a leader in the digital revolution by cultivating expertise in blockchain and cryptocurrencies.","Rakabuming Raka is the son of President Joko Widodo, speaking during an event on December 10 last year, the young mayor said: \u201CWe are preparing blockchain experts, we are preparing cybersecurity experts, we are preparing crypto experts,\u201D","But it seems the Joko Widodo era is now coming to an end, as Prabowo Subianto gains favour in the Indonesian elections on Wednesday. During press time Subianto was leading in the polls.","","Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority country, has banned the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. However, the country does allow investment in digital assets.","\u201CIndonesia\u2019s position in the global cryptocurrency landscape, securing the 7th spot in Chainalysis\u2019s crypto adoption rankings, is a testament to the region\u2019s strong inclination towards digital currencies, despite its fluctuating political climate,\u201D said Sung Min Cho, CEO and co-founder of Beoble, a Web3 messaging platform based in Asia, told Cryptonews. He further explained:","\u201CThis achievement is part of a broader trend in Asia, which is marked by high rates of blockchain technology adoption, underscoring the region\u2019s significant role in the global arena.\u201D","","Min Cho goes on to explain that what stands out is the clear enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies among Indonesians, with over 14 million actively trading, surpassing traditional stock traders.","\u201CThis not only speaks to the country\u2019s digital literacy and entrepreneurial spirit but also highlights the effort to bring financial services to the unbanked population. Even with regulatory uncertainties, this trend reflects a broader movement in Asia towards embracing decentralized financial systems, showing that neither businesses nor individuals in Indonesia have been deterred from exploring the potential of digital currencies,\u201D said Min Cho.","","In January, the Indonesian government reported a significant decline in crypto tax revenue for 2023, amounting to $31.7 million (Indonesian Rupiah 467.27 billion), according to a report by local news outlet Kontant.","The fall marks a sharp 63% drop compared to the partial collection period in 2022 when the crypto tax regime was introduced. This is one of several new taxes on the \u201Cdigital economy\u201D introduced in 2022 as part of an Indonesian tax reform. The government has stated that it expects the tax reform will \u201Cimprove tax collection,\u201D and ultimately lead to a \u201Chealthy and fair taxation system.\u201D\n\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Prabowo Subianto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sung Min Cho","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Beoble","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$31.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Prabowo Subianto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Indonesia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ganjar Pranowo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Min Cho","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Anies Baswedan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"63%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"December 10 last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Rakabuming Raka","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Joko Widodo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Subianto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gibran Rakabuming Raka","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulation","Indonesia","Politics"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
