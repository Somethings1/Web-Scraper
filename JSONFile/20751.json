Tradu claims fees are up to 95% lower than other platforms, with a standard commission of just 0.1% and additional rebates for larger trades. The comparison is based on a standard account type and information from broker websites, the statement said.","\u201CThe commission for a 1 BTC trade (at a price of $60,000) is just $30 at Tradu versus as much as $600 at other exchanges,\u201D the company added.","Tradu, headquartered in London, operates as a multi-asset trading platform. In addition to facilitating crypto exchange transactions, it enables trading across a broad spectrum of assets, spanning stocks, indices, commodities, and forex, totaling over 10,000.","With customer service available 24\/5 in 15 languages, Tradu ensures global traders can access assistance and advice whenever required.","\u201CWe are bringing institutional-grade pricing and infrastructure to the retail crypto market, providing traders with upfront costs and tight, transparent spreads enabling active traders and investors to maximise their returns,\u201D said Tradu CEO Brendan Callan.","The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and Hong Kong has triggered an influx of institutions into the crypto space. Major players like BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge, and traditional finance (TradFi) is scrambling to establish a foothold.","These regulatory green lights allow institutions to invest in crypto through secure channels, fueling wider adoption and boosting the overall liquidity of the market."],"entity":[{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$30","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$600","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tradu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"95%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jefferies\u2019 Stratos Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Brendan Callan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Crypto exchanges","Crypto trader"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
