It\u2019s being supported by both parties, and the reason that\u2019s the case is that it makes, effectively, the US dollar the default payment system worldwide \u2013 which everybody could get behind.\u201D","The USD-backed stablecoin issuers would be able to get a license in the US if they are willing to go through the accompanying \u201Cscrutiny.\u201D","O\u2019Leary argued that,","\u201CEven though it has nothing to do with Bitcoin, that will be the first regulation passed by US regulators, and I would argue you want to be long Bitcoin going into that outcome.\u201D","He said that there would be \u201Ca lot of interest in institutional capital coming into\u201D stablecoins, such as USD coin (USDC). The coin\u2019s issuer, Circle, O\u2019Leary noted, has received millions in investment already. Back in April, it said that it entered into an agreement for a $400M funding round with investments from BlackRock, Inc., Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace LLP, and Fin Capital. It also announced a $9bn valuation in February this year, up from the $4.5 billion seen in July 2021.","The Shark Tank star concluded that,","\u201CSo, end of the day, regulations come, Bitcoin goes up. [\u2026] \u201CIf institutions smell policy, then you\u2019ve got a real move up, and that\u2019s when you break out of this $19,000-$22,000 trading range against the US dollar. I think it goes right through that very quickly.\u201D","When it comes to the upcoming elections, should there be gridlock between the House and the Senate, it would result in \u201Cnothing done in Washington\u201D including \u201Cno more spending bills\u201D \u2013 which is good for equity markets but \u201Cindifferent\u201D for Bitcoin and crypto in general, O\u2019Leary argued.","The reason is that the bills floating around that do concern crypto are all bipartisan, he said \u2013 both the Democrats and the Republicans support some form of crypto regulation. Hence, which party controls which chamber becomes less relevant, he suggested. The regulations are coming.","At 10 UTC on Monday morning, BTC was trading at USD 19,342, down 0.5% in a day and up 1.5% in a week. It was down 2% in a month and 68% in a year.  ","You can watch the discussion here:","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Stablecoins Regulation Looms Large in Bill Before US Congress \u2013 Algo Versions Face Ban\n\u2013 Biden Administration Urges Speed Up of Crypto Regulation as Recession Fears Rise\n\n\u2013 Expert Trader Peter Brandt Says 50% Chance Bitcoin Can Go to Zero\n\u2013 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD 30,000 Barrier Soon\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin and Hard Assets Will Win as Inflation Rises, Novogratz Says and Sees BTC at USD 500K\n\u2013 Crypto Winter Will End Before 2022 Is Out \u2013 Korbit\n\n\u2013 Why Kevin O\u2019Leary Invested 20% Of His Wealth In Crypto\n\u2013 Kevin O\u2019Leary Calls For Crypto Regulation"],"entity":[{"type":"Kevin O\u2019Leary","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Fidelity Management and Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock, Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wonderful","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Congress \u2013 Algo Versions Face Ban\n\u2013 Biden Administration","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$22,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"November 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$400M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$19,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD 500K\n\u2013 Crypto Winter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fin Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peter Brandt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$4.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital\u2019s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"68%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Circle","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$9bn","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Marshall Wace LLP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto\n\u2013 Kevin O\u2019Leary Calls For Crypto Regulation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Regulation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Forecast","Market","Regulation","Stablecoin","USA"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
