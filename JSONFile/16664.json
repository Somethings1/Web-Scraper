The new crime bill removes the arrest requirement and lets courts order the confiscation of assets before an arrest is made. Though assets can be frozen to prevent movement, they still can\u2019t technically be seized from suspects until an arrest or conviction has been made.","The change is a plus, according to Phil Ariss, director of U.K. public sector relations at TRM Labs.","\"One area this will be used is on occasions where assets have been identified, significant links to criminality can be proven, but the subject of the investigation is unlikely to face justice in the U.K. \u2013 think of those committing fraud outside of the U.K. and targeting U.K. residents,\" said Ariss, who was crypto lead at the U.K. National Police Chiefs' Council cybercrime unit and is on sabbatical from the U.K. police force.","New civil forfeiture powers under the bill also let crypto linked to crime be seized irrespective of whether a person is convicted of criminal offenses in ongoing investigations or proceedings. Funds can be seized pursuant to court proceedings, the bill said.","\u201CThe creation of a crypto asset specific civil forfeiture power will mitigate the risk posed by those that cannot be prosecuted but use their funds to further criminality or for terrorist purposes,\u201D a government factsheet said.","Not having to wait for an arrest to freeze crypto can cut delays in enforcement work and prevent funds from being moved \u2013 something that can be done quickly in the case of crypto.","\u201CTime is of the essence,\u201D Ariss said. \u201CI'm sure there have been instances worldwide where delays have caused law enforcement to lose the assets because the subject, a third party, has moved the assets.\u201D","U.K. cops have already seized millions of pounds worth of crypto. The New Scientist reported in 2022 that police officers had seized more than £300 million ($371 million) in crypto tied to illegal activity. Around £180 million ($223 million) in cryptocurrency was seized in 2021 by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police.","But the new powers under the bill could improve those numbers, said Isabella Chase, senior policy adviser at TRM Labs.","Data from the National Crime Agency estimated illicit crypto transactions linked to the U.K. at around £1.24 billion ($1.53 billion) in 2021.","\u201CSo, you know, that's a decent amount that we can go after,\u201D said Isabella Chase, senior policy adviser at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.","It\u2019s likely that much of the crypto seized and successfully recovered by law enforcement will help fund crime fighting, according to Chase.","\u201CIt would go either to the law enforcement agency that seized the assets or to fund economic crime work. And then half of it goes to the Home Office again solely to fight economic crime work which is really important,\u201D Chase said.","Fighting crime is expensive, and U.K. cops have previously asked for more funding to help tackle crypto-related crime. The U.K. plans to contribute some £100 million ($124 million) to fight economic crime as part of a three-year plan, which is nearly 50% more than what was spent in 2020 \u2013 but won\u2019t be enough, according to Chase.","\u201CThat still won't be enough to pay for all the data capability and the law enforcement capability that the U.K. needs to have a really robust system to fight financial crime,\u201D said Chase, adding that the new seizure powers \u201Ccould be really positive\u201D in helping go after more millions in crime proceeds.","However, if the U.K. gets better at seizing crypto \u201Cthey might find that the pool of available targets quickly dwindles as suspected criminals move their assets offshore to less enthusiastically policed jurisdictions,\u201D Nick Barnard, partner at law firm Corker Binning said.","Read more: UK Police Have Crypto Experts Stationed Nationwide","Edited by Sandali Handagama and Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"Ariss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"TRM Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Phil Ariss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"100 million ($124 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.K. National Police Chiefs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Keystone Law told CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nick Barnard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Home Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Louise Abbott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$371 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"National Crime Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Isabella Chase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2002","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1.24 billion ($1.53 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"UK Police Have Crypto Experts Stationed Nationwide","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Corker Binning","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$223 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Sandali Handagama","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Analysis","Crypto","UK","Crime"],"authors":["Camomile Shumba"]}
