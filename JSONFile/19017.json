The project was first launched in December 2023.","In the project, participating banks can use Swiss franc wholesale CBDC to settle transactions with tokenized bonds on SIX Digital Exchange (SDX).","\u201CSettlement in central bank money is crucial for two reasons,\u201D Chairman Jordan noted in his remarks.","\u201CFirst, it eliminates credit risk and minimizes liquidity risk in settlement, thereby contributing to financial stability. And second, it reinforces the role of central bank money as the anchor for the monetary system.\u201D","He also explained how the pilot makes tokenized central bank money available on the third-party platform. It eliminates barriers in the current siloed financial market infrastructures, Jordan added.","\u201CThis approach aims to realize the benefits of tokenization, but also poses challenges.\u201D","Jordan outlined governance and fragmentation of central bank money as two wholesale CBDC challenges.","Chairman Jordan stressed that the Swiss National Bank is also testing two other settlement approaches to wholesale CBDC.","\u201CThe first alternative approach is linking the tokenized asset platform with the Swiss RTGS system,\u201D he said. \u201CThe second approach uses private token money which is issued on the tokenized asset platform and which is bankruptcy-protected and fully backed by sight deposits at the SNB.\u201D","The real time gross settlement (RTGS) approach addresses both governance and fragmentation of central bank money challenges. However, it also uses that old way of siloing operations and synchronizing through messages, he added.","Secondly, private token \u201Cenables an integrated approach to settlement whereby money and assets would be held on the same platform.\u201D Jordan added that this approach would address the governance, but not fragmentation challenge.","Both these approaches need careful assessment to study the benefits and risks associated with it, he noted."],"entity":[{"type":"Project Helvetia III","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Swiss National Bank\u2019s (SNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"RTGS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jordan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Swiss RTGS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thomas Jordan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SIX Digital Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Swiss National Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Basel","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","SIX Swiss Exchange","Swiss National Bank"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
