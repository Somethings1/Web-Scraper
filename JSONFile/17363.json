Nine transactions cost him over USD 800 in fees.","The epic donation spree amounts to a grand total of ETH 16,342, worth nearly USD 68m at the time, 49.3trn Akita Inu (AKITA) coins (worth approx. USD 431m at the time), 432trn Dogelon (ELON) tokens (USD 336m), plus 50trn Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, worth approximately USD 1.2bn at the time.","The moves came at the peak of so-called \u201Cmemecoin\u201D mania, during which multiple Dogecoin (DOGE) ripoffs like SHIB, AKITA, ELON, and others went through significant appreciations in value. However, many of the offloaded coins have collapsed up to -60% in value due to Buterin\u2019s actions.","Here\u2019s how the chain of the transactions looked like:","These nine transactions cost him ETH 0.217395307, which at the time of writing is worth around USD 844, while less than a day ago when the tokens were sent, it was valued at around USD 900. The most expensive transaction cost over USD 200, while the cheapest one was around USD 30.","In either case, some industry observers speculate that the move marks the beginning of Buterin\u2019s fight against meme \u201Cpump and dump\u201D coins that were clogging the Ethereum blockchain in the past few days, raising the transaction fees (gas) up to and over USD 200 per transfer.","As a result, some of the sold meme coins tanked up to 60% in the last 24 hours. At 9:00 UTC, SHIB lost \u2013 39% of its value, ELON tanked -61% and AKITA token lost -45% of its value. Most of Buterin\u2019s memecoins were sent to him by the meme project representatives in hopes to promote their projects.","Many in the community seem to praise Buterin for this move, which, according to some, could spell the end for the \u201Cmemecoin mania.\u201D For instance, a Reddit user u\/wallstreetdumbass called it a \u201C500 IQ play,\u201D arguing that it:","Bobby Ong, Chief Operations Officer (COO) at popular crypto market data provider CoinGecko, called Vitalik Buterin \u201Can absolute chad.\u201D Sandeep Nailwal, one of the initiators of India\u2019s Crypto COVID Relief Fund, as well as co-founder of Polygon (formerly Matic Network), took to Twitter to thank Vitalik Buterin for his generosity.","However, not everyone was praising Buterin.","Also, other memecoin holders were not so enthusiastic about Buterin\u2019s actions that caused their favorite coins to plummet in value. Soon after that, a new coin called \u201CFuck Vitalik Inu (FUCKVB) emerged on Ethereum blockchain with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000 tokens that were all sent to Buterin. (P.S. The sender, \u201CRULTON FYDER,\u201D paid USD 98 in fees for this transaction.)","Meanwhile, per Forbes, yesterday, Buterin also moved ETH 325,001 (USD 1.27bn) from his main public address to a separate wallet \u201Cgenerated via gnosis safe, a platform which allows one to manage assets on the Ethereum blockchain and enables multi-sig transactions.\u201D Vice president of digital asset strategy at New York-based Fundstrat Global Advisors, Leeor Shimron, commented that the purpose of the movement is unclear and could be to increase security or merely upgrade the coin setup.\n___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Rise of YFI & Woofy May Be a Bellwether for Rotation From Ethereum To DeFi\n\u2013 \u2018DOGE Killer\u2019 Shiba Inu Clogs Ethereum While Musk Lifts Dogecoin Again","\u2013 Why Ethereum is Far From \u2018Ultrasound Money\u2019\n\u2013 If History Rhymes, ETH Might Hit USD 19K; Downside Risk Stronger Than BTC\u2019s"],"entity":[{"type":"YFI & Woofy May Be","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"-61%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"-45%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bobby Ong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Matic Network)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"P.S","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fuck Vitalik Inu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"-60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ELON","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sandeep Nailwal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Forbes","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shiba Inu Clogs Ethereum While Musk Lifts Dogecoin Again","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Akita Inu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Leeor Shimron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"India","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Dogecoin","Ethereum","Fees","India","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Eimantas Å½emaitis"]}
