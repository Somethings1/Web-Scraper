O\u2019Neill, explains in his note that regulatory clarity should encourage banks into the stablecoin market.","\u201CAssuming the bill is approved, and that relevant banking regulation follows, the new rules may offer banks a competitive advantage by limiting institutions without a banking license to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. The bill is unlikely to significantly affect stablecoins already regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), including PayPal USD, Gemini USD, and Paxos USD, as they are well-below the $10 billion threshold and because it is otherwise broadly consistent with NYDFS guidance,\u201D said Andrew O\u2019Neill, managing director and co-chair of S&P Global\u2019s Digital Assets Research Lab.","Another important note from O\u2019Neill is that Tether\u2019s (USDT) dominance in the stablecoin market may wane. Tether is the largest stablecoin by outstanding volume, is issued by a non-U.S. entity and is therefore not a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, explains the S&P managing director.","\u201CThis means that U.S. entities couldn\u2019t hold or transact in Tether, which may reduce demand while boosting U.S.-issued stablecoins. We note, however, that Tether transaction activity is predominantly outside the U.S., in emerging markets, and driven by retail users and remittances,\u201D said O\u2019Neill.","In December, S&P Global said it had started assessing the ability of Tether to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar marking it at a \u2018constrained\u2019 rating of 4.","Stablecoins are a cryptocurrency whose value is usually pegged to a fiat currency or commodity. Tether has been under scrutiny for years \u2013 the stablecoin was issued in 2014 and is the longest-standing stablecoin with the largest volume in circulation. Its price has remained relatively stable in recent years and particularly over the past 12 months, noted the S&P in 2023.","The risk assessment is between 1 to 5 \u2013 with 5 being ranked weak. Tether had been scored weak due to the lack of information disclosed.","Another important point made by O\u2019Neill is that the removal of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s requirement that custodians report digital assets on their balance sheet could see more custody services emerge.","\u201CThat policy not only differs from the general treatment of financial assets held in custody, which are generally off-balance sheet but creates a capital requirement that likely discourages financial institutions from providing digital asset custody in the U.S. The new rules would remove that barrier and could lead to greater competition,\u201D said O\u2019Neill."," "],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York Department of Financial Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gillibrand","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"S&P Global\u2019s Digital Assets Research Lab","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andrew O\u2019Neill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gemini USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"PayPal USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lummis","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"S&P Global","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 17","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Paxos USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gillibrand","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the U.S.","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act","Stablecoin"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
