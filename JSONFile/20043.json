Young Ju said the balances discount centralized exchanges and Bitcoin miners, but include certain Bitcoin custodians such as Bitcoin ETF providers.","\u201CWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201D Young Ju wrote to Twitter regarding the data. Though whale balances have significantly increased since Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved in the United States this year, the executive says this week\u2019s balance spike was \u201Cnot ETF related.\u201D","#Bitcoin whales accumulated 47K $BTC in the past 24 hours.

Statistically, short-term holders are more likely to panic sell their holdings once their cost basis is lost, exacerbating price volatility at the time.","Regardless, Check also said that the dip was of a standard size seen in typical Bitcoin bull markets, and predicted it would make a good time to buy. As of Friday, Bitcoin has surged back to $62,700, proving profitable for anyone who followed his advice.","According to analyst TXMCtrades, the increased whale address balance may actually not represent whales accumulating coins, but instead show \u201Cinnocuous wallet management flow\u201D among larger entities.","\u201CThere are hundreds\/thousands of unidentified on-chain entities with big footprints, but people who don\u2019t look at this data all day will be encouraged to leap to wild conclusions,\u201D he wrote to Twitter on Friday.","Bitcoin ETF data shows that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) had net inflows on Friday for the first time since launching as a Bitcoin spot ETF, possibly signaling the first strong inflow day for Bitcoin ETFs at large in almost a month."],"entity":[{"type":"$57,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ki Young Ju","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$60,800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ju","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"James Check","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$62,700","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Young Ju","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 3, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$BTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u201D Young Ju","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$59,600","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin Whale"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
