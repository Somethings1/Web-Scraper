The exec believes the UAE\u2019s stable leadership, free from the back-and-forth policy changes of democracies, creates a more friendly environment for crypto businesses to grow.","In an interview with CryptoNews, he credited the country\u2019s \u201Cvery stable political basis\u201D as key to its startup friendliness. He also pointed to the UAE royal family\u2019s \u201Cgenius approach,\u201D which he believes has laid the groundwork for the country\u2019s booming economic growth.","Stadlemann was attesting to the UAE making efforts to welcome crypto companies. All virtual asset service providers need to get licensed from the Virtual Asset Regulatory before they can operate there.","The CTO also highlighted that UAE\u2019s low crime rate creates a safe environment that supports business growth. He attributes this to strict laws that target crime effectively.","On the other hand, he criticized the US for its overregulated crypto environment.","","The Securities and Exchange Commission is typically called out for its \u201Coverreach\u201D in handling crypto-related matters. In 2023, the regulator filed 46 enforcement actions within the industry and raked up fines worth $2.8b.","\u201CI believe the US (crypto economy) is being let down,\u201D Stadelmann said. He added that he knows of several crypto projects that have chosen to relocate from the US to more welcoming regions like Latin America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the UAE.","\u201CI believe they need industry experts involved, with all due respect. But I believe that\u2019s what you get when you have a bunch of boomers and noobs try to regulate something they really literally don\u2019t understand,\u201D he said.","\u201CAfter years of struggle within the regulatory layer, you just get tired of it. And that\u2019s kind of where we are.\u201D","The crypto exec called for a smarter approach to crypto regulation. He emphasized the industry\u2019s wealth of expertise in core blockchain technology and its principles. This knowledge, he says, can be harnessed to develop regulations that protect investors and prevent illegal activity, without stifling innovation. Stadlemann believes regulators need to re-evaluate their current frameworks to find a more balanced approach.","","For over 7 years, Stadlemann has been part of the team at Komodo, an open-source, end-to-end blockchain and cryptocurrency platform. JL777, an anonymous leader, spearheaded Komodo\u2019s creation in 2014. This decentralized platform allows developers across industries to conduct anonymous transactions.","The exec now plans to relocate from Amsterdam to the UAE, leaving what he sees as growing hostility towards crypto in the Netherlands. This trend is also causing DEX and DeFi projects to depart the Netherlands.","Facing regulatory hurdles in the Netherlands, Binance too pulled out of the Dutch market after failing to secure a virtual asset service provider license.","Stadelmann cited Dubai\u2019s \u201Cextremely startup friendly legal framework\u201D as the reason behind his relocation.","\u201CI have a huge network of crypto entrepreneurs, and they\u2019re following the same trend,\u201D he said. \u201CThey are heading down to Dubai, to Abu Dhabi.\u201D","\u201CI believe the UAE is going to take over the financial world and become the financial epicentre in regards to what Frankfurt, London, Zurich, New York, Chicago are today.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Stadlemann","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Amsterdam","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Netherlands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Stadelmann","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Frankfurt","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Zurich","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Komodo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chicago","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United Arab Emirates\u2019 (UAE","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.8b.","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Southeast Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Latin America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"the Netherlands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kadan Stadlemann","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Abu Dhabi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CTO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UAE","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Dubai","UAE"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
