Generally, users who want to become Ethereum 2.0 validators and earn rewards need to stake a minimum of ETH 32, which is a high price.","However, Lido enables users to pool their ETH and participate in staking even if they don\u2019t have the required ETH 32. The protocol distributes stETH tokens to users in return for their staked coins, which can be redeemed for ETH in the future or traded for other coins.","The Merge is Ethereum\u2019s long-anticipated update expected to happen by the end of the year.","The upgrade has several benefits, Buterin said, noting that it makes Ethereum more environmentally friendly compared to the current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. According to last year\u2019s estimate by a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, this upgrade can cut the energy used by the Ethereum network by at least 99.95%.","\u201CAlso, proof of stake can increase the safety of the system. It makes it more expensive to attack,\u201D Buterin told Fortune. \u201CIt makes it easier to recover from an attack, which is something people don\u2019t think about.\u201D","Another benefit is that PoS is more censorship-resistant. That is because, Buterin says, \u201Cminers are easier to detect and easier to shut down than just computers that are running validator nodes.\u201D","Meanwhile, at 10:33 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 1,156, up by 3% over the past 24 hours and down 4% over the past 7 days. The coin is also down by more than 76% compared to its all-time high of USD 4,878 recorded in November last year.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Dominant Staking Pool Lido Causing \u2018Long Lasting\u2019 Damage to Ethereum, But Aims to Improve\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Ropsten Test is \u2018Almost\u2019 Bug-Free, Two More Testnets to Go Before the Merge\n\n\u2013 Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of \u2018Extreme\u2019 Risk in Proof-of-Stake Systems\n\u2013 The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network\n\n\u2013 Contradictory Vitalik Buterin Says He Wants a More Bitcoin-like Ethereum\n\u2013 Top Blockchain Non-Financial Applications According to Vitalik Buterin\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Beacon Chain Experienced a 7-block Reorg, More Work Needed Ahead of The Merge\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist"],"entity":[{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"76%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Beacon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Merge\n\n\u2013 Major Bitcoin & Crypto Companies Warn of \u2018Extreme","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Beacon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lido Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"99.95%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Lido","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"The Merge\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Merge Could Lower Demand for Bitcoin but Regulatory & Technical Challenges Persist","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Decentralization","Ethereum","Proof-of-stake","Security","Staking","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
