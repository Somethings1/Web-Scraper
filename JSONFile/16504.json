The agency discovered the violations using blockchain explorer tools.","The fine comes just six months after Binance agreed to pay U.S. regulators a $4.3 billion fine for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, and a week after former Binance CEO and co-founder Changpeng \u201CCZ\u201D Zhao was sentenced to four months in U.S. prison for failing to set up an adequate KYC\/anti-money laundering (AML) program at the exchange.","Binance is also battling financial regulators in Nigeria, where it has been accused of taking Nigerian naira and charged with money laundering and tax evasion. An American Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, the head of financial compliance for the exchange, was taken into custody in February and charged with the same crimes.","Earlier this week, Binance CEO Richard Teng called on the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan, and wrote in a blog post that, back in January before Gambaryan\u2019s arrest, \u201Cunknown persons\u201D had requested a \u201Csignificant payment in cryptocurrency\u201D to make the charges go away. The requested bribe was reported by the New York Times to be $150 million.","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gambaryan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 1, 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"C$6 million ($4.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July 19, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Financial Transactions","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Richard Teng","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tigran Gambaryan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$4.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nigeria","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"American Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$150 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Binance","Regulation","Fines","Canada","FINTRAC"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
