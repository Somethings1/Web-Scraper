It recorded a noteworthy outflow of nearly $23 million, marking a significant event in the cryptocurrency market.","This outflow trend, the first of its kind since its introduction in January, had a ripple effect beyond Fidelity Bitcoin ETF. It impacted other prominent funds in the cryptocurrency market, painting a broader picture of the market\u2019s current state.","On the same day, notable names in the cryptocurrency market, such as ARK 21Shares\u2019 ARKB, Valkyrie\u2019s BRRR, and Bitwise\u2019s BITB, recorded outflows of $31.3 million, $20.2 million, and $6 million, respectively.Â ","According to SoSoValue data, the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF outflow on Thursday amounted to $22.61 million. This departure from its typical performance showed a shifting sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin market.Â ","Franklin Templeton\u2019s EZBC emerged as a top performer among the affected funds, attracting a net inflow of $1.87 million. However, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC counterbalanced this positive momentum, experiencing a substantial drainage of $139 million.","Daily Flows: @Grayscale \u2018s $GBTC and @BlackRock \u2018s $IBIT pic.twitter.com\/Uik7HRSuUH","\u2014 HODL15Capital ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@HODL15Capital) April 26, 2024","","AnalystsÂ attribute the lack of significant fund inflows to the post-Bitcoin halving environment.

BlackRock\u2019s IBIT fund continued its trend of zero inflows on Thursday, mirroring its performance from the previous day. Other funds that reported no inflows on Thursday include Invesco\u2019s BTCO, VanEck\u2019s HODL, WisdomTree\u2019s BTCW, and Hashdex\u2019s DEFI.","In a recent report from SoSoValue from April 17, Bitcoin also saw significant outflows in the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market, notably highlighted by Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) witnessing a net outflow of $79.38 million.","This contributes to GBTC\u2019s historical net outflow of $16.46 billion. Conversely, the BlackRock ETF IBIT saw a net inflow of approximately $25.78 million, reflecting a divergent trend in investor sentiment.","Further insights highlight the magnitude of outflows from GBTC, reaching as high as $643 million, while other ETF products witnessed modest inflows.","On the other hand,Â while BlackRock\u2019s 71-day streak of continuous inflows ends, signaling a potential shift in the Bitcoin market, there\u2019s notable turbulence in the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market.","Preliminary data from Farside Investors reveals a significant decline in BlackRock\u2019s IBIT popularity. For the first time since its launch, the fund failed to attract new investments, contrasting with the modest inflows seen in Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.","Concurrently, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC faced substantial withdrawals, culminating in a net outflow of $120.6 million\u2014the largest since April 17.","Despite the initial enthusiasm and heavy investments, the sentiment towards Bitcoin ETFs has cooled off this month, dampening the previous momentum in the Bitcoin market.","AsÂ Hong Kong prepares to launch Bitcoin and Ether ETFs by the end of April, aiming to challenge the United States\u2019 dominance in the digital asset space, regulatory hurdles and competition with established U.S. financial giants pose significant challenges.Â ","Moreover, whileÂ Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETF recently secured a record $40 million investment, concerns persist over low public participation in Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin alongside the challenges hindering broader ETF adoption."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$16.46 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.87 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$40 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$IBIT","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$5.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$79.38 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$58.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$23 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NH Investment and Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$643 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$120.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitwise\u2019s BITB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$139 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$20.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$35 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Farside Investors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$GBTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$25.78 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 17","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$31.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$22.61 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$9.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Fidelity"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
