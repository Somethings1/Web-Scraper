Ether also saw a significant downside, losing 6%, and the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, lost 6% as well. Reuters reported that U.S. issuers expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to deny their applications to launch spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after discouraging meetings with the agency in recent weeks. In traditional markets, tech stocks declined after Meta failed to live up to high expectations for its first-quarter earnings report.","BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which trades under the ticker IBIT on Nasdaq, fell out of favor on Wednesday, preliminary data published by Farside Investors showed. For the first time since going live on Jan. 11, the fund did not draw any investor money, snapping a 71-day inflows streak. Seven of the other 10 funds followed IBIT\u2019s lead. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) registered inflows of $5.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, while Grayscale\u2019s GBTC bled $130.4 million, leading to a net cumulative outflow of $120.6 million, the highest since April 17.","U.S. House Representative Maxine Waters (D-California) indicated that the final version of a stablecoin bill could be ready soon. \"We are on our way to getting a stablecoin bill in the short run,\u201D the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee told Bloomberg on Wednesday. Waters has previously called a version of the stablecoin bill \u201Cdeeply problematic and bad for America.\" \u201CIt\u2019s about making sure investors and that the people are protected,\u201D Waters told Bloomberg. \u201CWe have to ensure that they have those assets to back up stablecoins,\u201D she said. The latest development strengthens hopes that the U.S. can get a new stablecoin law before the elections this year, which was considered a longshot at the start of the year.","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"First Mover","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$4.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S. House Representative Maxine Waters (D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Farside Investors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 17","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$130.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$120.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$64,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ether","First Mover"],"authors":["Lyllah Ledesma","Omkar Godbole"]}
