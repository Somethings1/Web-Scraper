Insane number for newbie ETF (esp one w ten competitors). $1b\/day is big boy level volume, enough for (even big) institutional consideration,\u201D posted Balchunas on X.","Earlier this month, VanEck slashed its fees for the HODL exchange-traded fund (ETF), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust down to 0.20% from 0.25% according to a recent filing submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Currently, almost all of the Bitcoin ETF fees range from 0.19% to 0.39%.","Nearly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs are competing for investor attention in a saturated market. BlackRock has set its fee for the iShares ETF at 0.12% for the first 12 months or until the first $5 billion in assets under management, after which it plans to increase it to 0.25%.","Other issuers, such as ARK Invest, charge 0.21%, and Bitwise charges 0.20%. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are increasingly the go-to choice for mainstream investors. They address issues like storing crypto assets and dealing with fraudulent service providers.","Aurelie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at Nansen, said in a recent interview with Cryptonews.com that she expects lower-fee ETFs to attract more inflows in the short term.","Many investment firms have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market as demand for such products continues to heat up.","So far, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Galaxy, as well as Cathy Wood\u2019s Ark Invests and 21Shares, have all submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF."],"entity":[{"type":"Cathy Wood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"0.12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitwise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1,3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$IBIT","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"VanEck Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$2.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nansen","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Principal Research Analyst","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eric Balchunas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"0.19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.21%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$56,400","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Galaxy","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1b","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Blackrock","Bloomberg"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
