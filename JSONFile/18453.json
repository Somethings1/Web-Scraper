When asked whether he owned Bitcoin assets, he admitted buying some digital currency earlier.","He said the purchase was solely for experimenting with its use case. Its subsequent rise to fame led him to sell his BTC stash due to his mental health, however.","Bitcoin captured widespread attention last month, primarily attributed to the January 11 approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).","According to CoinShares, total inflows for digital asset investment products have exceeded $7.7 billion thus far. Bitcoin has continued to lead the pack, with $703 million in inflows recorded last week alone, a trend that has become customary.","üü¢ Digital asset investment products saw large inflows totalling US$708m last week!","üìà This brings year-to-date inflows to US$1.6bn and total global assets under management to US$53bn.","üìâ Trading volumes in ETPs fell to US$8.2bn (compared to US$10.6bn the prior week), but\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/phsy5zjnTf","\u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) February 5, 2024","","Other crypto assets like Solana averaged $13 million in total inflows last week, while Ethereum and Avalanche pulled in $6.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.","The underlying idea behind Bitcoin\u2019s creation in 2009 was to become the default means of transferring value.","The digital asset\u2019s permissionless nature meant that centralized entities like banks and other legacy institutions could not control or authorize the movement of assets, as no intermediary was involved.","While many believe this might be possible in the long run, Wozniak clearly offered a contrary opinion. According to him, Bitcoin cannot outrightly usurp state-backed fiat currencies.","He explained that this is because fiat currency has been crucial throughout history. Instead of replacing fiat entirely, Bitcoin can coexist alongside it as a secondary means of value exchange.","Wozniak\u2019s views align with many industry experts who believe Bitcoin can become a secondary value exchange medium. A few, like MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor, however, have encouraged people to ditch fiat and keep value solely in Bitcoin.","If you're not worried, you don't need #Bitcoin.pic.twitter.com\/a6TDQALaEc","\u2014 Michael Saylor‚ö°Ô∏è (@saylor) February 5, 2024","","Sharing a post on X, Saylor wrote, \u201CIf you\u2019re not worried, you don\u2019t need Bitcoin\u201D on a video showing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealing his worries about the United State\u2019s debt profile."],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US$8.2","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$13 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US$53bn","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wozniak","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United State","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steve Wozniak","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$703 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2009","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jerome Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$6.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$7.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Apple","Bitcoin ETF","state-backed fiat"],"authors":["Jimmy Aki"]}
