They all are Stores of Value with market cap leader Bitcoin having a decade-plus long history of transactions and wealth generation,\u201D Cuban said, adding that \u201Cthere are a growing number of investors and traders who think that the digital goods and cryptoasset marketplaces are better than old school physical markets and the stock market and most of them are young.\u201D","\u201CThey love the fact that NO ONE has power over them,\u201D according to the billionaire.","These statements come at the time when Cuban stepping up his own crypto-related activities. Last week, he minted his first Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Rarible platform, and also spoke out about his \u201Cshitcoin\u201D collection.","One of the tokens features a dancing Cuban, fully decked out in Mavericks merchandise, and has already attracted a bid of over USD 13,000 for eight editions.","And now, as the National Basketball Association (NBA) has entered the business of trading digital NBA collectibles on blockchain, the owner of a basketball club claims that a store of a value is \u201Csomething that some number of people assign value to and are willing to pay for and then hold on to, hoping that circumstances increase the value of that item.\u201D","However, another fellow billionaire, Mike Novogratz, might not agree with Cuban. According to Novogratz, very few cryptoassets will stand the test of time and become lasting stores of value outside of BTC.","In either case, according to Cuban, conventional traders appear to be nonplussed by the remarkable rise of crypto.","He wrote,","\u201CThis generation doesn\u2019t care what Old School Wall Street thinks or says about valuations. They don\u2019t care about Price Earnings Ratios, or NPV of future cash flows, or what the analysts say [about] the earnings per share this quarter. [They] don\u2019t care at all. They have learned from their experiences watching Wall Street go up and down and making people who aren\u2019t them a ton of money; that it\u2019s a game designed to reward the people with the most money.\u201D","The conclusion that \u201Call these narratives are just sales pitches designed to sell stocks\u201D has driven younger investors to \u201Cwant to change the game and kick [Wall St.\u2019s] ass,\u201D something that \u201Cthey should and have every right to,\u201D Cuban wrote.","He also poured scorn on those who would seek to ridicule the Reddit-based movement that has seen members of a number of subreddits initiate price drive campaigns that have sent Wall Street into meltdown.","Cuban opined that \u201Cthere is zero difference between\u201D investors \u201Cfollowing advice from Reddit or someone on CNBC or Bloomberg.\u201D","He added,","\u201CThey also know that the more they work together, the less power Wall Street has. They know that fat and happy Wall Street has become slow, stale and set in their ways, which makes [it] an easier target than anyone would expect.\u201D","___\nLearn more:\nGameStop: How Redditors Played Funds For Billions (And What Might Come Next)\nNon-Fungible 2021: Prepare Your NFTs For DeFi, Staking, and Sharing\nBridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio Sends Stronger Bitcoin Signal\nFew Tokens Besides Bitcoin To Become SoV, Ethereum To Reshape Finance \u2013 Novogratz\nElon Musk Sees \u2018Broad Acceptance\u2019 For Bitcoin"],"entity":[{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dallas Mavericks","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"this quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sharing\nBridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio Sends Stronger Bitcoin Signal\nFew Tokens","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the National Basketball Association (NBA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum To Reshape Finance \u2013 Novogratz\nElon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ethereum","Investing","Non-fungible tokens"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
