The bill, which has been in the pipelines since September 2021, seeks to legalize mining and ensure that miners pay taxes and declare their activities.","Many Paraguayan politicians have argued that the mining sector could be a major money-spinner for the government and power companies. The nation is home to a number of large hydroelectric power stations that periodically produce surplus power.","As this surplus power often cannot be used by Paraguayans, many advocates have called for international miners to be encouraged to set up shop near dams and power plants. While other industries have little use for irregular power supply, this is not the case for miners, whose rigs can take advantage of power when it is available and sit idle when this is not the case. Miners from as far afield as Canada and China have already been courted, with talks still ongoing with some of the parties fleeing China\u2019s crypto crackdown of September 2021.","El Pais reported that an abundance of \u201Cvery cheap electricity\u201D has turned the nation into a \u201Cpromised land for profitable Bitcoin mining,\u201D and remarked that former \u201Cjungles\u201D in Ciudad del Este, San Pedro, and Paraguarí have already become major mining centers.","This is also the case in \u201Crural towns\u201D with high populations of ethnic Germans, such as Villarrica.","The bill, which must now be approved or vetoed by President Mario Abdo Benítez, will seal the fate of the nation\u2019s crypto mining sector.","But Luis Benítez, a university professor and long-time home crypto miner, claimed that only industrial miners stand to benefit \u2013 and that \u201Camateur and domestic\u201D miners stand to gain nothing from it. Benítez claimed that politicians had \u201Conly met with large mining firms\u201D before formulating the bill, and had created legislation \u201Cvery hastily, without taking into account issues pertaining to energy and tax policy.\u201D","In fact, power companies have also expressed their concerns. A national energy provider has previously asked the government to oblige miners to pay in advance for electrical power \u2013 and to settle their bills in USD.","Other political critics have claimed that the energy should instead be donated to poorer families.","But the reality of the situation is that right now, Paraguay has little use for hydroelectric power. The media outlet explained that the country has \u201Chardly any industry or infrastructure\u201D that can harness the electrical energy, so \u201Cits seven million inhabitants cannot benefit from\u201D the resource. Instead, public transport, cars, and agricultural vehicles generally make use of fossil fuels \u2013 meaning that a mere 20% of Paraguay\u2019s hydroelectric power actually gets used in the country where it was generated.","This means that some miners have been wooed with promises that they will pay as little as USD 18 per megawatt hour for electricity. This is a huge difference from \u201Cthe average price paid in South America,\u201D which, per the former energy minister Mercedes Canese \u201Cis around USD 100 dollars per megawatt hour.\u201D","Canese claimed that this price was too low, and claimed that energy importers are charged higher rates than miners.","Canese opined that \u201Cin the context of climate change,\u201D it does not make sense to \u201Cdedicate so much energy to something that does not produce [anything] and does not create jobs.\u201D","She added that many miners only agreed to set up shop in Paraguay if they were allowed to make use of subsidized rates, and bemoaned the fact that crypto mining does not \u201Cgenerate wealth\u201D for the nation.","Miners, she said, were making big profits from \u201Craw materials,\u201D and \u201Con top of that enjoying subsidies.\u201D","Regardless, there is evidence that mining could provide some new opportunities for certain Paraguayans. The media outlet gave the example of the Villarrica resident and native Christian Katz, who has built a business that helps miners connect to the internet.","But there are other wrinkles that are perhaps forcing Paraguay\u2019s hand when it comes to fast-tracking crypto mining regulation. Under a bilateral agreement with Brazil, which shares many of the rivers that are damned by Paraguayan power stations, Paraguay must donate all the electricity that it does not make use of (or sell) to its neighbor.","And in 2019, illegal crypto miners were found stealing electricity from hydroelectric power plants \u2013 perhaps highlighting the need to legalize and tax the industry before it can go underground.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Paraguay\u2019s Senate Approved a Bill Regulating Crypto Mining and Trading\n\u2013 Paraguay: Bitcoin & Crypto Mining Bill Passes Senate, Heading to Lower House\n\n\u2013 Paraguayan Senate to Debate Taking Bitcoin Mining \u2018Out of the Grey Area\u2019\n\u2013 Q2 Saw Over 59% of Bitcoin Mining on Sustainable Energy Mix \u2013 Bitcoin Mining Council\n\n\u2013 \u2018The Reckoning\u2019 & \u2018The Best Time\u2019 to Enter Bitcoin Mining as Firms Diversify Amid Bear Market\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining in 2022: New Locations, Technologies, and Bigger Players"],"entity":[{"type":"Lower House\n\n\u2013 Paraguayan Senate to Debate Taking Bitcoin Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Time\u2019 to Enter Bitcoin Mining as Firms Diversify Amid Bear Market\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD 100 dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u2013 Paraguay\u2019s Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining on Sustainable Energy Mix \u2013 Bitcoin Mining Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Mario Abdo Benítez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bill Regulating Crypto Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"South America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Christian Katz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Luis Benítez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin & Crypto Mining Bill Passes Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Villarrica","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Paraguayan Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"San Pedro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ciudad del Este","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brazil","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Paraguay","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Grey Area","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Brazil","China","Ecology","Latin America","Mining","Politics","Regulation","Tax"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
