Today (at 8:21 UTC), Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at USD 30,657, down by nearly 21% in a month and over 55% from its all-time high. Likewise, Ethereum (ETH) is down 32.5% in a month, and 61% from its all-time high, currently trading at USD 1,905. ","Despite all the uncertainty around crypto, Holmes said that he\u2019s still confident in the future of digital currencies.","Cryptocurrency \u201Cis obviously here to stay and it\u2019s going to be here for a long time despite recent selloffs and volatility,\u201D he said. \u201CI think adopting it, bringing it into the mainstream is important.\u201D","As reported, MoneyGram first unveiled a partnership with Stellar in October 2021, announcing plans to create instant money transfers using USD coin (USDC) stablecoin.","Prior to working with Stellar, MoneyGram had a partnership with major remittance network Ripple. Signed in 2019, the partnership allowed MoneyGram to use Ripple\u2019s product for cross-border payment and foreign exchange settlement.","However, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against Ripple, alleging that it had been engaged in illegal security offering through sales of XRP, MoneyGram was also slapped with a lawsuit over its false and\/or misleading statements regarding the legal status of the XRP token.","Consequently, the money transfer company ended its partnership with Ripple. Still, MoneyGram said its support for Ripple would remain in place.","Notably, MoneyGram\u2019s new initiative arrives as remittances become more popular in emerging markets. According to the World Bank, as cited by Bloomberg, remittances to low- and middle-income countries increased to USD 589bn last year and are projected to further grow this year.","The relationship between remittances and digital currencies has also grown significantly. Countries like El Salvador, which accuse money transfer companies of charging hefty fees, have even made Bitcoin legal tender to allow for a more efficient way of money transfer.","\u201CThere are billions of cash-dependent people globally who could benefit from the utility that digital assets and blockchain provide,\u201D said Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Development Foundation, adding:","\u201CThe answer is what we\u2019re building through this partnership \u2014 a service for helping them go from cash to digital assets.\u201D","At the time of writing, the 25th coin by market capitalization, Stellar\u2019s native token XLM, is trading at USD 0.14, up by nearly14% over the past 24 hours and 4% in a week. The coin is down 20.6% in a month and 83.8% from its all-time high of USD 0.875 recorded in January 2018.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Stellar Rallies On MoneyGram Partnership Announcement\n\u2013 XRP Jumps as Ripple\u2019s Partnership With MoneyGram Ends (For Now)\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Co-Founder Raises USD 450M & Bashes Solana\n\u2013 Russia Mulls Crypto for Int\u2019l Payments\n\n\u2013 Banks Exploring Blockchain, Tokenization Again is a \u2018Fire Signal We\u2019re in a Bear Market\u2019\n\u2013 What Is Cryptocurrency Utility and Why It\u2019s Important for the Development of Crypto Payments"],"entity":[{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"8:21","content":"TIME"},{"type":"the World Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin (BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the Development of Crypto Payments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra ecosystem","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"nearly14%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Co-Founder Raises USD 450M & Bashes Solana\n\u2013 Russia Mulls Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MoneyGram","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Holmes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"21%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"55%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"32.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"83.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Alex Holmes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"61%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stellar Development Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Denelle Dixon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tokenization Again","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Payments","Stablecoin","Stellar"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
