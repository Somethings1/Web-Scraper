Kennedy Airport on Saturday and will be presented in front of a Southern District of New York (SDNY) magistrate judge today. He faces one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of narcotics conspiracy, one count of money laundering, and one count of conspiracy to sell adulterated and misbranded medication.","The first charge \u2013 sometimes called the \u201Ckingpin statute\u201D \u2013 carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison. Ross Ulbricht, the creator and operator of the now-shuttered Silk Road darknet drug marketplace, was found guilty of the same crime and sentenced to life in prison. The narcotics conspiracy charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum potential sentence of life in prison. The other two charges carry a combined maximum of 25 years in prison.","Lin allegedly made millions from operating Incognito Market, which took a 5% cut of every sale. The darknet market had its own \u201Cbank,\u201D prosecutors said, which gave users an additional layer of anonymity by allowing them to deposit cryptocurrency into their own accounts, which the site then automatically transferred from buyers to sellers, minus the fee.","According to the complaint, Lin created and operated Incognito Market while an undergraduate student at the prestigious National Taiwan University.","In March, Incognito Market shut down after reportedly pulling an exit scam that left users unable to withdraw their funds. Administrators of the site then reportedly began extorting vendors, ordering them to pay a fee ranging from $100 to $20,000, depending on their size, or else risk having their customers\u2019 data leaked.","Lin, a self-described crypto developer and fan of privacy coin Monero, said on X that he facilitated a four-day workshop on cyber crime and cryptocurrency for 30 police officers at the Saint Lucia Police Academy in early April.","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"Southern District of New York (SDNY","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ross Ulbricht","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$20,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Saint Lucia Police Academy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John F.
