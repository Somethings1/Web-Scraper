And it\u2019s rise is telling us something. https:\/\/t.co\/f4jVY7HiPg","Meanwhile, the general anti-crypto sentiment coming from the US government has likely led some in the community to believe that more regulation could be coming to the US.","Among those who have already taken steps to prepare for that scenario is Circle, the issuer of the popular stablecoin USDC, which just this week announced that it had applied for regulatory approval in France.","The announcement from Circle came as the company\u2019s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, concluded a trip to Europe, where he also praised efforts by UK officials to make the country \u201Ca crucial global market for innovation in digital assets.\u201D","Thanks Lord Johnson.
