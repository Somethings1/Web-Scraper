On May 16, Billy Markus, co-founder of Dogecoin, voiced his doubts about their approval, saying that the SEC is \u201Ccompromised\u201D and may not approve the ETFs.","Markus made his skeptical comment in response to an X post discussing the importance of the approval of spot Ether ETFs for the ecosystem and the potential impact of a negative decision on Ethereum. He tweeted a response that \u201Cnothing good will come out\u201D of the spot ETH ETF application.","Markus\u2019 comment reflects a broader pessimism about the SEC\u2019s ability to make fair and unbiased decisions regarding Ethereum and cryptocurrency.","i don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important personally","the SEC is compromised anyway, nothing good will come out of it until the house is cleaned","\u2014 Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) May 15, 2024","","Given this, Markus believes the regulator\u2019s decision on spot Ether ETFs won\u2019t negatively impact Ethereum\u2019s trajectory or the cryptocurrency market as a whole. The Dogecoin creator\u2019s views also echo the prevalent skepticism surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs.","Recently, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson suggested that Ethereum\u2019s legal classification will play an important role in the upcoming ETF decisions.","I'm aware this is widely considered a possibility, but this is your official notice that the SEC is considering the security question for ETH in this upcoming spot ETF order. Note that this question was never (afaict) asked regarding a spot\/futures BTC ETF product. pic.twitter.com\/TwhqmTnJfC","\u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) May 14, 2024","","Johnsson\u2019s view shows a key distinction in the SEC\u2019s approach to Bitcoin and Ethereum.","Ethereum\u2019s classification is receiving more regulatory scrutiny than Bitcoin, where its security status wasn\u2019t a major focus during spot ETF filings. This shows a shift in focus between the two cryptocurrencies, suggesting a changing regulatory process for digital assets.","The upcoming decision dates for VanEck and ARK Invest\u2019s applications for Ethereum ETFs, scheduled for May 23 and May 24, respectively, have sparked intense speculation within the crypto industry.","The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs is not just about price movements; it also carries symbolic importance, solidifying crypto\u2019s legitimacy as an asset class and reaffirming its role in the evolving financial industry.","The trend toward regulatory clarity is evident, as seen in the SEC\u2019s recognition of Ethereum\u2019s non-security status through the approval of an Ethereum futures ETF for trading in October 2023. Thus, the SEC established a clear precedent for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.","Experts believe any deviation from this path would create regulatory uncertainty and weaken market confidence.","Hong Kong\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as their trading, demonstrate the increasing global acceptance and recognition of the potential of Ethereum-based financial instruments."],"entity":[{"type":"May 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 16","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Scott Johnsson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shibetoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Billy Markus","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Markus","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 23","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Dogecoin","SEC","Spot Ether ETF"],"authors":["Jimmy Aki"]}
