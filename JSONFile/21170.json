Households, firms, financial markets and sovereigns have become too used to low interest rates and accommodative financial conditions, also reflected in historically high levels of private and public debt,\u201D the BIS boss said.","He added that it will be challenging to transition to what he called \u201Cmore normal levels\u201D for rates, and said it will be important to set \u201Crealistic expectations of what monetary policy can deliver.\u201D","Carstens further stressed that central banks should not be expected to \u201Csingle-handedly ensure global growth by keeping an accommodative stance in all conditions.\u201D","However, the BIS boss still pointed out that central banks around the world \u201Chave been here before,\u201D referring to the inflationary period of the 1970s. ","\u201CThey are fully aware that the short-term costs in terms of activity and employment are the price to pay to avoid bigger costs down the road,\u201D he said.","Describing the current inflationary environment, Carstens also said that inflation has now \u201Caccelerated\u201D in the service sector, where price growth tends to remain for longer than for goods.","As a result, inflation may become \u201Cmore entrenched\u201D than previously anticipated, Carstens said.","He added that supply bottlenecks remain in sectors such as shipping, semiconductors, and regionally in countries that still enforce Covid-related lockdowns.","However, these factors have now been combined with new inflationary pressures in food, oil, and many other commodities, with much of this increase seen since the start of the war in Ukraine.","Further, Carstens pointed to three developments that he said have led him to believe inflation has become more persistent than what was previously believed:","In summary, Carstens opined that the rise in inflation came \u201Cas a surprise to most observers.\u201D","\u201CAs it began to rise, forecasts were revised up. But, even mid-year, most observers projected only a modest and temporary overshoot of central bank targets. In the end, inflation far exceeded the forecasts,\u201D the head of the BIS said.","_____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 War in Ukraine to Make Countries Rethink Currency Dependencies \u2013 BlackRock CEO\n\u2013 How War in Ukraine Is Increasing Inflationary Pressure Across World\u2019s Regions\n\n\u2013 Fed Raises Interest Rate by 25 Basis Points in First Rate Hike Since 2018\n\n\u2013 The Ukraine War: How Russia\u2019s Aggression Affected Bitcoin & Crypto and What Might Happen Next\n\u2013 Fed Can\u2019t Stop Prices From Going Up Anytime Soon, But There\u2019s Good News, Too"],"entity":[{"type":"International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"How Russia\u2019s Aggression Affected Bitcoin & Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Increasing Inflationary Pressure Across World\u2019s Regions\n\n\u2013 Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bank for International Settlements\u2019 (BIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Agustín Carstens","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Geneva","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"What Might Happen Next\n\u2013 Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1970s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Covid","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Carstens","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"First Rate Hike Since","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Central Bank","Economics","Forecast","Inflation"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
