Rather, the \u201Csame activity, same risk, same regulation\u201D principle should be applied, he said, while noting that investors need to be fully aware of the risks."],"entity":[{"type":"Fabio Panetta","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Panetta","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ECB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Panetta","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Central Bank (ECB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Basel","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bank for International Settlements (BIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"22nd Annual Conference","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["ECB","EU","Gambling","Regulation"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
