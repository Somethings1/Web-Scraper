This follows warnings from regulators about unlicensed virtual asset products and a risk assessment by the Central Bank highlighting money laundering and terrorist financing concerns.","This assessment highlighted the potential for money laundering and terrorist financing associated with virtual assets, underlining the need for regulatory measures.","Kenya\u2019s 2022 anti-money laundering report identified virtual assets and virtual asset service providers as areas needing attention.","Further, Kenyan authorities uncovered at least $20m injected into the economy in 2023 through suspicious M-Pesa withdrawals. These transactions were linked to the now-suspended iris-scanning project Worldcoin. ","Kenya boasts the highest cryptocurrency activity and interest in the East Africa region. It even ranks among the top five markets across the entire continent.
