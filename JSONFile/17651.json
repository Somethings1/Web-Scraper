During an ask-me-anything session on the Ethereum subreddit back in 2020, Buterin revealed the extent of his non-ETH crypto holdings, explaining that he held smaller positions in \u201Cnon-ethereum-ecosystem tokens\u201D including bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin (BTC), dogecoin (DOGE), zcash (ZEC) and omisego (OMG). He also owns shares in some of the companies he has invested in.","Ethereum\u2019s fate \u2013 and that of its co-founder \u2013 have turned around spectacularly since the dark days of the last crypto winter, when ETH prices plunged, leading to Buterin \u201Closing more than USD 460 million\u201D \u2013 and leading sarcastic Redditors to offer to donate him funds.","Indeed, the worth of his holdings shrunk to a mere USD 40m in November 2018. And although his main wallet now holds less ETH than it used to, its worth has skyrocketed.","After busting through the key USD 3,000 mark earlier, the coin is still moving upwards at a rate of knots. At 08:37 UTC, ETH trades at USD 3,184 and is up by 11% in a day and 38% in a week. The price rallied by 49% in a month and 1,388% in a year.","Sarcasm was in very short order on Reddit today, with most congratulating Buterin on doing what many crypto enthusiasts have only dreamed of \u2013 and accomplishing it all by the tender age of 27.","One wrote that Buterin \u201Cdefinitely deserves it,\u201D while others in the same thread called him a \u201Clegend\u201D and a \u201Cgenius.\u201D","On another thread, a poster pointed out that Buterin was now the \u201Csecond-youngest self-made billionaire\u201D on the planet, and remarked,","\u201CWhat a chad. The chaddest of chads.\u201D","___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin and Brian Armstrong Weigh in on NFTs\n\u2013 Ethereum\u2019s Buterin Says Tether Is Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018Ticking Time Bomb Demon\u2019","\u2013 Social Recovery Wallet is Better For Your Cryptoassets \u2013 Buterin\n\u2013 \u2018Dumb\u2019 Blockchains Keep Gaining Adoption, Gold Is \u2018Lame\u2019 \u2013 Vitalik Buterin","\u2013 Ethereum King Buterin Loses Live Showdown to Twitch Chess Queen\n\u2013 After Bashing Yield Farming, Buterin Offers a \u2018Billion Dollar\u2019 DeFi Idea"],"entity":[{"type":"Brian Armstrong Weigh","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BCH","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1,388%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"11%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"38%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"49%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum King Buterin Loses Live Showdown to Twitch Chess Queen\n\u2013 After Bashing Yield Farming","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ZEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
