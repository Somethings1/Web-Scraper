The release detailed the following reasons for its decision, claiming that cryptoassets:","\u201CToday\u2019s announcement by the Central Bank of Turkey was not a surprise, as there were recent statements by the Central Bank and other authorities about the need for a regulation of the crypto industry in Turkey,\u201D Elbruz Yilmaz, MENA Managing Director at Bitpanda Turkey, told Cryptonews.com, stressing that this ban does not affect crypto trading.","According to him, users in Turkey are able to utilize bank wires for their deposit and withdrawal processes with crypto exchanges and brokers, while Bitpanda \u201Ccontinues its operations as usual.\u201D","\u201CWhen it comes to Fintech, we would be appreciative if the government would go more into the direction of \u2018smart regulation\u2019, ready to be changed at any point and allowing innovation and personal freedom,\u201D Yilmaz said, adding that today\u2019s digitalization speed compared to the legislation speed makes a law outdated as soon as it is implemented.","\u201COur expectation and correspondence with local authorities indicate that they are working on a comprehensive set of regulations which will support the development of the crypto industry in Turkey,\u201D he added.","Meanwhile, Turkey\u2019s central bank banned the use of cryptoassets to purchase goods and services, a week after Turkish authorities demanded user information from trading platforms, Reuters added.","Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition party CHP, criticized the government in a tweet for failing to discuss the ban with all cryptocurrency participants before announcing the ban, Bloomberg reported.","The regulation should have been \u201Ccommunicated in a better way given the level of disinformation,\u201D Ozgur Guneri, CEO of BtcTurk, one of Turkey\u2019s largest crypto platforms in terms of number of clients, told Bloomberg. \u201CUsers won\u2019t have a hard time making investments in digital currencies, business will go as usual,\u201D he said. \u201CThis mainly targets electronic payment systems.\u201D","The central bank has struggled to control the descent of the lira in recent months, and in a statement yesterday, it announced that it had decided to keep interest rates at a sky-high 19%.","Ahval reported that Erdogan\u2019s decision to appoint a new governor of the bank last month has \u201Craised concerns among investors that Turkey will keep monetary policy too loose in the face of accelerating inflation and a weak lira.\u201D","\u201CTaxes might come next.
