The investment firm did not admit or deny the SEC\u2019s findings and agreed to a cease-and-desist order and a censure in addition to the monetary penalty.","\u201CFund boards rely on advisers to provide accurate disclosures, especially when involving issues that can impact the advisory contract, known as the 15(c) process,\u201D said Andrew Dean, co-chief of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Asset Management Unit at the SEC.","\u201CVan Eck Associates\u2019 disclosure failures concerning this high-profile fund launch limited the board\u2019s ability to consider the economic impact of the licensing arrangement and the involvement of a prominent social media influencer as it evaluated Van Eck Associates\u2019 advisory contract for the fund,\u201D added Dean.","In recent years, a handful of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan, Floyd Mayweather, Jake Paul and Matt Damon have promoted cryptocurrency projects and faced the wrath of the regulators in the United States.","There are many reasons why an increasing number of celebrities have been getting involved in the promotion of finance and crypto products. The most obvious is due to the lucrative financial opportunities. Another popular reason is publicity and branding which play a crucial role in a celebrity being relevant in today\u2019s society.","Over the years, crypto and non-fungible tokens have experienced growth and just by associating themselves with cryptocurrencies can increase a celebrity\u2019s visibility and appeal to a younger audience interested in digital assets.","Last week VanEck slashed its fees for the HODL exchange-traded fund (ETF), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust down to 0.20% from 0.25% as competition in the market heated up. Nearly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs are competing for investor attention in a saturated market.","BlackRock has set its fee for the iShares ETF at 0.12% for the first 12 months or until the first $5 billion in assets under management, after which it plans to increase it to 0.25%.","Other issuers, such as ARK Invest, charge 0.21%, and Bitwise charges 0.20%. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are increasingly the go-to choice for mainstream investors. They address issues like storing crypto assets and dealing with fraudulent service providers."],"entity":[{"type":"0.20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Lindsay Lohan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"0.12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitwise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"VanEck Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Van Eck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Andrew Dean","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.75 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kim Kardashian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"0.21%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Floyd Mayweather","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Enforcement Division\u2019s Asset Management Unit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Van Eck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Matt Damon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Van Eck Associates","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jake Paul","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Influencers","Securities Exchange Commission","VanEck"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
