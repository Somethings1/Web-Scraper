The product has yet to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).","","On February 12, Franklin Templeton was the latest asset manager to file a spot Ethereum ETF application with the SEC \u2014 joining \u200B\u200Ba long list of asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Invesco and Galaxy, as well as Cathy Wood\u2019s Ark Invests and 21Shares, all of which have submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF.","Last week, the SEC announced a delay in its decision regarding Franklin Templeton\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF, extending the deadline to June 11. This news comes from a filing made public, leaving the future of this financial product uncertain for the time being.","The proposed ETF seeks to track the price of ether and would utilize Coinbase Custody Trust Company and the Bank of New York Mellon as custodians.","In March, the SEC delayed a decision to approve the BlackRock spot Ethereum ETF.

It has been widely reported that several U.S.-based companies have received subpoenas attempting to label ETH as a security.","Ethereum is viewed as a decentralized cryptocurrency, rather than a security. However, regulatory agencies like the SEC continue to monitor the cryptocurrency space and may provide further guidance and sudden changes or new rulings in the future. It\u2019s essential to stay updated on regulatory developments.","On Thursday, it emerged, that Ethereum developer firm Consensys, managed by Joe Lubin, filed a lawsuit on April 25 against the SEC over its \u201Coverzealous regulation\u201D around the Ethereum blockchain.","In an announcement on social media platform X, Lubin said Consensys has taken an important step towards \u201Cpreserving access to ether and, by extension, the Ethereum blockchain in the U.S. We are suing the SEC and fighting back against its overzealous regulatory overreach.\u201D","In a blog post, Consensys said the SEC\u2019s reckless approach is causing chaos to developers, market participants, institutions, and nations that are building or already managing critical systems running on Ethereum, the world\u2019s largest platform for decentralized applications."],"entity":[{"type":"Cathy Wood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Coinbase Custody Trust Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank of New York Mellon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Consensys","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 25","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Joe Lubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 23","content":"DATE"},{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Justin Sun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DTCC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Depository Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 11","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum ETF","Franklin Templeton"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
