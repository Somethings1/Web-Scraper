Hackers took control of the account and used it to spread misleading information about a supposed smart contract breach.","From 6.30 UTC on Wednesday, six alarming warnings have surfaced on the Rocket Pool X account, falsely claiming vulnerabilities in their smart contracts. The warnings advised users to migrate their assets to a new smart contract to ensure safety.","The messages posted intermittently, warned of bad actors exploiting the protocol\u2019s smart contracts and creating a sense of urgency among users to take immediate action.","\u201CBad actors are performing fake deposit attacks. Migrate to the new contract below to ensure your assets are safe,\u201D one of the messages said.","Several other users on X pointed out the scam attempt. For instance, the popular account Webacy told users that Rocket Pool\u2019s account was compromised.","\u201CThe link goes to a drainer. Do not migrate your assets,\u201D one warning from the account said.","üö®Rocket Pool is compromised. The link goes to a drainer.","Do not migrate your assets.

Many users helped out by spreading the message on X too:","DO NOT CLICK ANY LINKS FROM THIS ACCOUNT!

The X crypto community recently witnessed the compromise of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) account earlier in January.","As of this writing, suspicious messages can still be found on the Rocket Pool X page, almost 24 hours after the first suspicious message was posted.","However, at least one post has been marked with a \u201Ccommunity note\u201D telling users the account has been hacked.","Rocket Pool is a decentralized application (dApp) listed as the fifth-largest on Ethereum.
