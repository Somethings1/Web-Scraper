Potential benefits include faster settlements, around-the-clock trading and increased efficiency. The RWA market could mushroom to over $10 trillion by the end of the decade, according to separate reports by Boston Consulting Group and digital asset manager 21.co.","\"It was obvious that there was going to be a sea change in the financial markets and we wanted to be a part of that,\" Celebuski, who serves as president and chief operating officer at Ironlight, said in an interview with CoinDesk.","After leaving their TradFi tenures, the founders raised $12 million from mostly high-net-worth individual investors in their network to put together a team and build the tech from the ground up, Celebuski said.","With no plans for allowing cryptocurrency trading on the platform, the company's goal is to leverage distributed ledger technology, or DLT, to connect buyers and sellers in a more seamless way. They also plan to partner with sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and traditional market makers to facilitate trading tokenized assets.","The development behind the trading venue is at advanced stages, and the company has already applied to be a regulated broker-dealer by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and expects an approval in the next few months, Celebuski said.","After that, Ironlight will start the SEC registration process for an ATS, which is necessary to operate a digital marketplace, he added.","\"We felt that making this work under U.S. regulations would be important to be seen as completely regulatory compliant no matter which venue or regulation we would be under,\" Celebuski explained.","A regulated ATS could make a positive impact on liquidity for tokenized assets, especially if it manages to attract sufficient subscribers, Doug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research, told CoinDesk in an email.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"HSBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Financial Industry Regulatory Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$12 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Schroders","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Doug Schwenk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Boston Consulting Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Abu Dhabi Investment Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ADIA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Rob McGrath","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Digital Asset Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ironlight","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ironlight","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DLT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\" Celebuski","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"TD Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Abu Dhabi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Abel Noser","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Greg Braca","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Matt Celebuski","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Celebuski","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Real World Assets","Tokenization","Tokenized Assets","ATS","FINRA","SEC"],"authors":["Krisztian Sandor"]}
