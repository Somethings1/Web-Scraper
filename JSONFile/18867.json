Any user ranging from a single PC owner to a large data center can share resources through Golem and get paid in GNT (Golem Network Tokens) by requestors. \u201CA decentralized network powering true cloud computing,\u201D adds their short description on Medium.","Today, such resources are supplied by centralized cloud providers which, are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations \u2013 and, well, by the fact that they are centralized, bringing to light a myriad possible problems. One of the greatest issues is the erosion of trust in the past few years, reinforced by scandals such as the Facebook privacy issue, for example.","The question of the importance of their mainnet launch has a simple answer: in their announcement, they explain, \u201COur decision is based on the fact that even though this new stage will expose our project to diverse risks, it is not possible (or responsible) to say a product is finalized without real users.\u201D","\u201CGolem is a dApp [decentralized application], and as any other, it required testing through a contained \u201Claboratory\u201D. But in order to progress, we need to get out of this comfort zone, and make sure the elements that we have worked hard, and continue to build, are responsive and working well on a decentralized setting,\u201D they added.","In 2016, Golem raised ETH 820,000 ETH during their ICO.","Since the mainnet launch announcement, the GNT token has risen in price by 22.23% as of 08:44 am UTC.","Golem price chart",""],"entity":[{"type":"22.23%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"GNT (Golem Network Tokens","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Golem Project","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Blockchain","Decentralization","Ethereum"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
