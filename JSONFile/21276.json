Interoperability, coupled with the blockchain, \u201Cmeans that players truly have the right to own their assets instead of just \u2018renting\u2019 them from some big platform.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Open Meta DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marketplace","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Emergence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Emergence Marketplace","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Emergence SDK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ryan Gill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Open Meta Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ubisoft","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cryptonews","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crucible Networks","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Unity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gameplay","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Gaming","Metaverse"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
