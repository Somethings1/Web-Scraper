These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system,\u201D James said in 2021. ","Tether responded to the news about its reserves being backed by Chinese securities in a blog post on Friday.","\u201CTether is in a completely different position compared to 2 years ago. It demonstrated, leading the industry during the biggest black swan events in 2020 and 2022, that its reserves are extremely liquid, of high quality and ready to be made available to support any size of redemption, as shown in 2022, when Tether repaid US$7 billion in 48 hours, almost 10% of its reserves at that time,\u201D the firm said. "],"entity":[{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Letitia James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tether Holdings Ltd.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"China Construction Bank Corp.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US$7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Agricultural Bank of China Ltd","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"China Evergrande Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg News","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["China","Tether"],"authors":["Sarah Wynn"]}
