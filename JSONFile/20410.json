If all L3s settled to one L2, then Ethereum would capture basically no value and, thus, Ethereum security would be at risk.\u201D","He further clarified that Polygon does not oppose the development of L3s on other networks, including Polygon itself. ","However, he emphasized that their mission is to scale Ethereum while ensuring fair value distribution between Polygon and Ethereum.","I agree that L2s are Ethereum. I disagree that L2 value is Ethereum value. Just take this to the extreme. If all L3s settled to one L2, then Ethereum would capture basically no value and, thus, Ethereum security would be at risk.","\u2014 Marc Boiron (@0xMarcB) March 31, 2024","","Layer 3 protocols are designed to operate on top of L2s and provide application-specific decentralized applications with enhanced scaling, performance, interoperability, customization, and cost-efficiency. ","The L3 ecosystem includes various solutions from L2 networks such as Orbs, Xai, zkSync Hyperchains, and the recently launched Degen Chain on Arbitrum Orbit. ","Despite the growing interest, the L3 sector remains relatively small, with only four L3 tokens listed on CoinGecko.","Peter Haymond, the senior partnership manager at Offchain Labs, countered Boiron\u2019s arguments, highlighting the benefits of L3s that don\u2019t deplete Ethereum\u2019s value. ","He pointed out advantages such as the low cost of native bridging from L2, cost-effective on-chain proofs, custom gas tokens, and specialized state transition functions.","Meanwhile, Patrick McCorry, a researcher at the Arbitrum Foundation, said that L3s offer compelling advantages, including enabling L2 networks to become settlement layers and leveraging Ethereum as a global ordering service and final judge of settlement.","\u201CSurprised by take. L3s seem like a no brainer, especially when it allows the L2 to eventually become a settlement layer (ie executing the bridge is cheaper) and ultimately relying on Ethereum as global ordering service + final judge of settlement.\u201D","The debate surrounding L3 networks comes amid the recent launch of the Degen Chain network.","Built on Arbitrum Orbit, Degen Chain was introduced by infrastructure provider Syndicate on March 28th as a specialized ultra-low-cost network for the Degen token ($DEGEN). ","This token has become the community\u2019s go-to option for users of the Farcaster Web3 social media service, which operates on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network. ","Consequently, Degen Chain functions as a Layer 3 network, or L3.","It is worth noting that early adopters of Degen have transformed small investments into substantial profits. ","One trader, who initially put in less than $7,000, walked away with over $2 million in profits. ","Only invested 3 $ETH($6,991) on $DEGEN, this trader made $2.15M, a gain of 308x!","He spent 3 $ETH($6,991) to buy 277M $DEGEN on Jan 8, then sold 77M $DEGEN for 134 $ETH($370K), with 100M $DEGEN($1.79M) left.https:\/\/t.co\/j3vq0Op2S5 pic.twitter.com\/468vrPQ0Xq","\u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 26, 2024","","While amassing wealth through meme coins is not new in the crypto world, Degen\u2019s adoption as one of the first L3 chains to gain significant traction is noteworthy. ","On Degen Chain, an ecosystem of additional meme coins, denominated in $DEGEN, has generated tens of millions of dollars in trading volume."],"entity":[{"type":"Degen Chain","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 31, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$DEGEN($1.79","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Arbitrum Orbit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Xai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2.15","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$ETH($370K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Degen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$7,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$ETH($6,991","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Offchain Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Degen Chain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marc Boiron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Boiron","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 28th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Peter Haymond","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Arbitrum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Degen Chain on Arbitrum Orbit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Degen","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$DEGEN","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Patrick McCorry","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Polygon"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
