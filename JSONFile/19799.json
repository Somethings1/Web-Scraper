It\u2019s just like we don\u2019t use gold as an asset class for our clients,\u201D he said.","\u201CIt\u2019s not that people can\u2019t invest in there. We just look at asset classes or, you know, what belongs in a long-term portfolio, what has intrinsic value, has cash flows to it? And those are the asset classes we steer people towards. And so we don\u2019t go towards bitcoin or gold or any other of those stable assets.\u201D","A Vanguard spokesperson further elaborated on the firm\u2019s perspective in a comment to Insider, claiming that the firm is still skeptical of cryptocurrencies.","\u201CUnlike stocks and bonds, most cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows, such as interest payments or dividends,\u201D the spokesperson reportedly said.","\u201CFurther, cryptocurrencies have proven to be highly volatile, which runs counter to Vanguard\u2019s goal to generate positive real returns to investors over time.\u201D","The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies has been a point of contention, with the SEC previously rejecting several Bitcoin ETF applications.","However, Grayscale Investments recently won a court case against the SEC, raising hopes that regulatory obstacles may soon be cleared for the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.","Despite Vanguard\u2019s stance, enthusiasm for a potential spot bitcoin ETF continues to grow on Wall Street.","Prominent cryptocurrency advocate Mike Novogratz recently expressed his belief that blocking an ETF would make no sense.","This sentiment is mirrored by market trends, as inflows into digital asset funds reached their highest weekly level since July 2022.","According to a CoinShares report, digital asset investment inflows reached $326 million for the week, with Bitcoin accounting for 90% of the inflows.","It is worth noting that the anticipation of a spot ETF approvalÂ has led to a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price in recent weeks.","The cryptocurrency rallied towards $35,000 earlier this month, driven by market speculation surrounding the potential approval of a spot ETF.\nThe surge in price has not only caught the attention of investors but has also sparked a renewed interest in crypto trading, leading to a significant increase in daily exchange volumes.","As reported, the seven-day moving average for spot exchange volumes across reputable platforms breached an impressive $24 billion on October 26, a level not seen since the end of March."],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$35,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$24 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$326 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tim Buckley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Vanguard","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin ETF","Blackrock"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
