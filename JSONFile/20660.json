He elaborated on the progress made in streamlining the manufacturing of A14 series mining machines, advancements in the development of next-generation A15 series units, and ongoing R&D of the A16 series.","Their decision follows the recent fourth halving event on the Bitcoin network, in whichÂ Zhang emphasized its potential for emerging opportunities in the Bitcoin ecosystem.","\u201CNow that the fourth bitcoin halving occurred on Friday, we expect many more opportunities will emerge in the ecosystem,\u201D Zhang added.","Established in 2013, Canaan is a technology company specializing in ASIC high-performance computing chip design, chip research and development, computing equipment production, and software services.","Under the leadership of Nangeng Zhang, the company\u2019s founding team achieved a significant milestone by shipping the world\u2019s first batch of mining machines incorporating ASIC technology in Bitcoin\u2019s history under the brand name Avalon.

The company disclosed revenue of $49 million, marking a 16% decrease compared to the same period the previous year.","Additionally, Canaan reported a widening net loss of $139 million, compared to $91.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Despite an uptick in the amount of computing power sold and a recovery in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $66,089, Canaan attributed the revenue decline to selling its ASICs at lower prices relative to the market throughout last year.","Also, Canaan\u2019s annual report for the year 2023Â revealedÂ a net loss of $414.2 million, compared to a net income of $69.9 million in 2022. Total revenues, including product and mining revenue, declined significantly by 67.5% to $211.5 million in 2023 from $651.5 million in 2022.","The revenue decline was attributed to a decrease in the average selling price of Canaan\u2019s Bitcoin mining machines on a per-Thash basis, dropping from US$40.8 per Thash in 2022 to US$8.9 per Thash in 2023. This decrease resulted from soft demand and a price drop in computing power throughout 2023.","Despite the revenue decline, mining revenue amounted to $34 million in 2023, slightly higher than the $32.5 million recorded in 2022, according to the company\u2019s report."],"entity":[{"type":"Nangeng Zhang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zhang","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 28, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin ASIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$32.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US$8.9","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Canaan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chief Financial Officer","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"fourth quarter of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$414.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nasdaq Global Market","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$139 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$34 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Avalon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 27","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$49 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"67.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US$40.8","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nangeng Zhang","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the fourth quarter of 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$211.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"James Jin Cheng","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$91.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Canaan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$66,089","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$651.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$69.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Mining","Canaan"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
