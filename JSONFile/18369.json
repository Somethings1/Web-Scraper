This collateral consists of two tokens: TITAN and Polygon-based USDC, as well as STEEL and binance USD (BUSD) on BSC.","In the second post, the team explained that since the price of TITAN dropped to 0, the contract does not allow redemptions. Twelve hours of timelock will need to pass before USDC redemptions are once again enabled.","At 7:50 UTC, IRON is trading at USD 0.68, after it dropped 32% in the past day. STEEL is also down 69% in a day, now changing hands at USD 0.56.","Cryptonews.com has reached out to Iron Finance for comment.","All this suggests that algorithmic stablecoins \u2013 those that \u201Caim to maintain a stable price by automatically adapting the stablecoin supply to meet demand,\u201D as Gyroscope Protocol\u2018s Ariah Klages-Mundt wrote \u2013 come with risks of their own.","In regards to Iron Finance, Klages-Mundt, who is an applied math PhD student at Cornell University, argued that \u201Cthe bank run is self-reinforcing with the price collapse of the Titan token that implicitly backs the algorithmic portion.\u201D","Per Anderson Kill Partner Preston Byrne, this incident \u201Chas to do with the fact that all algo stablecoins are, economically speaking, total bullshit. [\u2026] Algo stablecoins have been tried for years and years and they always blow up.\u201D","\u201CI got hit like everyone else,\u201D Cuban confirmed. \u201CCrazy part is I got out, thought they were increasing their TVL [total value locked] enough. [Then] Bam.\u201D","Earlier this week, he said that \u201Ccrypto Businesses make more sense than you think and valuing tokens is easier and makes more sense than you think.\u201D","In a related blog post, Cuban also revealed that he \u201Cplaced some money\u201D in certain blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, including Polygon.","He then explained that he was \u201Ca small\u201D liquidity provider for the decentralized exchange QuickSwap, providing two different tokens: DAI and, you guessed it, TITAN.","\u201CBut the cool thing is while I don\u2019t get any extra rewards for this pair (you reading this Titan and Quickswap ???), I am currently the only [liquidity provider] in this pool, so I get 100pct of the fees. In every pool, the LPs, get a percentage of the fees based on the percentage of the liquidity they provide,\u201D he wrote.\n____","__","__","__","__","__","____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 DeFi Has Had a Strong 2021, Driven By New Trends & Paradigms\n\u2013 The BTC-Colonial Pipeline FUD Gives A Lesson On Bitcoin Security\n\u2013 Two More Binance Smart Chain Projects Report Incidents, Prices Plummet"],"entity":[{"type":"TITAN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Titanium Token (TITAN)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD 0.56","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New Trends & Paradigms","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Iron Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"32%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Preston Byrne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dallas Mavericks","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mundt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cornell University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD 0.68","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Titan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"69%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Klages","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Colonial Pipeline FUD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 17","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ariah Klages","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June 16","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","DeFi","Trading"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
