I think a few things need to happen for the bottom to hit: 1. Inflation needs to ease, 2. Unemployment needs to stabilize and 3. Weaker US dollar,\u201D Shayne Higdon, Co-Founder and CEO of the HBAR Foundation, said in an emailed comment.","On Monday at 16:01 UTC, bitcoin traded at USD 20,786, up 4% for the past 24 hours and down 22% for the past 7 days. At the same time, ethereum (ETH) stood at USD 1,132, up 6% for the day and down almost 22% for the week.","Although bitcoin remained in positive territory for the past 24 hours, the lower prices earlier in the weekend caused relatively large liquidations of leveraged traders who were long. According to data from Coinglass, close to USD 109m were liquidated in the 12 hours between midnight and noon on Saturday in the bitcoin market alone.","Notably, however, the liquidations were still smaller than the massive long liquidations seen on June 13, when BTC fell from USD 26,000 to around the USD 22,000 level.","Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, pointed out that many altcoins have not seen liquidations at the same high level as BTC and ETH, with some altcoins even showing strength.","\u201CThis is because bitcoin and ethereum are the primary uses of collateral for leveraged positions, and the fact we can see on-chain the various liquidation prices means that a cascade lower can be premeditated,\u201D Sotiriou wrote in a market commentary today.","He further added that this could be a reason why big buyers have not yet stepped up to take advantage of the lower prices in BTC and ETH, saying \u201Cmajor buyers can see other peoples\u2019 liquidation levels.\u201D","Notably, liquidations over the weekend also led to a historic loss for bitcoin holders, according to Sotiriou. Citing on-chain data from Glassnode, the analyst said that this liquidation cascade led to the largest realized loss in USD terms in Bitcoin\u2019s history, with over USD 7.325bn in losses realized by investors.","He added that on-chain data also shows that BTC holders with 1-year-old coins \u201Ccapitulated\u201D over the weekend.","Meanwhile, the long-term holder (LTH) supply has declined by BTC 178,000 over the last week, equivalent to 1.31% of their total holdings, Glassnode said, noting that the current spending behavior by LTHs taking losses coincides with March 2020 but is not quite as severe as the 2015 or 2018 bear market lows. ","On-chain data this weekend also indicated that Bitcoin miners have come under even bigger pressure and that many have chosen to turn off their machines.","The bitcoin on-chain analyst Will Clemente of the mining and equipment provider Blockware Solutions commented on the data and said that the combination of a lower BTC price, higher difficulty, and higher energy costs \u201Chave put serious pressure on miners\u2019 margins.\u201D","Lower Bitcoin price, higher hash\/difficulty, and higher energy costs have put serious pressure on miners margins. Hashprice is now its lowest since October 2020.\n\nHash ribbons have crossed (bot. left), indicating machines unplugging + Miners sending BTC to exchanges. (bot. right) pic.twitter.com\/x7J7pYTZ9W","Glassnode added that miner capitulation is now \u201Chappening in real-time\u201D:","\u201CMiners are now under significant financial stress, with BTC trading near the estimated cost of production, incomes well below their yearly average, and hash-rate noticeably coming off [all-time highs].\u201D","Using the Puell Multiple, an oscillator tracking miner USD denominated income, and the Difficulty Ribbon Compression model, Glassnode concluded that the contraction in miner income is worse than \u201CGreat Migration in May-July 2021,\u201D when miners left China following a ban there.","Still, \u201Cminers have faced worse days in 2018-2019 and 2014-2015 bear markets, where the Puell Multiple reached 0.31,\u201D Glassnode said.","Meanwhile, the latest data from CoinShares once again showed outflows from regulated crypto-backed investment funds.","Overall, USD 38.6m left crypto investment funds last week, with USD 69.9m leaving ETH-backed funds alone. Still, the overall figure improved thanks to inflows in BTC-backed funds of more than USD 28m, in addition to smaller inflows into multi-asset crypto funds.","The inflows last week mark a reversal from the week prior when USD 102m were pulled out of crypto-backed funds and USD 57m left BTC-backed funds.","Commenting on the broader outlook for the market on Monday, Jason Choi, an angel investor and former general partner at crypto hedge fund Spartan Group, hinted that the crypto market may have reached peak bearishness.","\u201CNot saying it will happen but peak sentiment like this often set up hated rallies,\u201D Choi wrote on Twitter, suggesting that funds that are now sitting on losses need to participate in potential rallies in order to stay in business.","P.S. the one notable shift in sentiment in the past 24 hours was the increased probability of a cash-rich party plucking holes in the market to temporarily prevent further cascades. https:\/\/t.co\/lAfNb9xvmT","A similar sentiment could also be seen in the comments from crypto trader Alex Krüger, who wrote that a dip below the USD 20,000 level for BTC and USD 1,000 level for ETH would for many now represent buying opportunities.","This marks a shift from last week when a dip below the same levels would only cause further selling from \u201Cpanic sellers, forced sellers and breakout sellers,\u201D Krüger wrote on Twitter.","He added that the number of stop-losses under the USD 20,000 for bitcoin is \u201Cvery small relative to what it was before.\u201D","\u201CMany traders like me shorted 20k and won\u2019t be shorting 20k again as the reduced presence of stops makes shorting much less attractive,\u201D the crypto trader wrote.","Lastly, Nik Bhatia, a finance professor at the University of Southern California and author of the bitcoin book Layered Money, reminded his newsletter readers that this is far from the first time that bitcoin experiences a selloff of this magnitude.","\u201CBitcoin has faced 12 drawdowns of this same magnitude in its history, and yet it\u2019s still here,\u201D Bhatia wrote in a newsletter.","He added that although bitcoin may not be behaving like a safe-haven asset now, it still remains a safe haven from \u201Ccentral bank cronyism, authoritarian transaction controls, and currency debasement.\u201D","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 US Fed to Blame for Downturn,
