And the platforms, the intermediaries are doing things that we would never allow or think the New York Stock or Nasdaq would do.\u201D","","ðŸ”¥Bloomberg TV just interviewed Gary Gensler regarding the Ripple case!! ðŸ¤¡#XRPCommunity #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com\/imRmf9uOvf","The SEC Chair once again highlighted that crypto platforms are not compliant with laws that protect customers from fraud.Â ","\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of noncompliance in this field. The platforms themselves, where trading is occurring of various crypto tokens, currently they\u2019re not necessarily compliant with those time-tested protections against fraud and manipulation.\u201D","Gensler\u2019s comments come after aÂ US court ruled in favor of RippleÂ in the ongoing lawsuit brought by the SEC, claiming that selling XRP on exchanges in itself does not constitute an investment contract.Â ","The ruling, issued by theÂ District Court for the Southern District of New York, stated that the \u201Coffer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts.\u201D","However, the federal judge also ruled thatÂ XRPÂ is a security when sold to institutional investors, as it met the conditions set in the Howey Test.","Gensler had previously saidÂ he was disappointedÂ with the decision, adding that the commision is \u201Cstill looking at it and assessing that opinion.\u201D","The SEC has ramped up its scrutiny of crypto companies following the recent collapse of some high-profile crypto companies.Â ","Last month, the commissionÂ sued bothÂ Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, andÂ Coinbase, the largest US-based cryptocurrencyÂ exchange.Â ","The commission has also taken enforcement action against crypto exchangesÂ KrakenÂ andÂ Bittrex, as well as crypto lending platformÂ NexoÂ so far this year.Â ","Meanwhile, the increasing regulatory scrutiny has forced crypto companies to consider relocating to more favorable countries.Â ","Coinbase has alreadyÂ established a presence in BermudaÂ and may launch an international exchange.","Additionally,Â Bittrex, formerly based in Seattle, has ceased operations in the US, whileÂ GeminiÂ is contemplatingÂ a move to the United Arab Emirates.","According to an April report byÂ Electric Capital, the US\u2019s share of blockchain developers has been declining over the past five years.Â ","This decline,Â dropping from 40% in 2017 to 29% in 2020, suggests that the regulatory uncertainty in the US might be driving crypto away.Â ","Â "],"entity":[{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Electric Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bermuda","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"New York Stock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United Arab Emirates","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"29%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"theÂ District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bittrex","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"the Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Seattle","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USÂ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["SEC","Securities and Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
