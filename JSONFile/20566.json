South Korea\u2019s biggest business groups, per Fair Trade Commission data, are Samsung, SK, Hyundai Motor, LG, and Lotte.","The executive reportedly made some UD 30,000 worth of ETH by operating a mining machine at a company facility he was in charge of, later adding a second machine to his operation. He began his mining efforts in 2019 and, the company stated, used USD 3,500 worth of electricity to power the machines, which ran \u201C24\/7\u201D until they were eventually discovered in May.","The illegal operation erupted into \u201Ccontroversy\u201D as facility engineers began suffering as a result of the \u201Cnoise and heat\u201D the rigs generated in workspaces. The media outlet noted that a number of workers at the facility had \u201Cfailed to renew their contracts this year.\u201D","One engineer was quoted as stating that the cacophony and heat were \u201Ctremendous\u201D \u2013 driving indoor temperatures to the 40°C mark. ","The same engineer, who also stated he had not renewed his contract, claimed that he had reported the executive to the \u201Cinvestigative authorities,\u201D and complained that even though the decision to leave had been his, \u201Cit still feels like a dismissal.\u201D","A company official stated that it was \u201Cclearly wrong to operate a cryptocurrency mining machine\u201D on company premises and that the \u201Camount of illegally used electricity\u201D was \u201Cnot insignificant.\u201D","And the executive\u2019s misdeeds did not end with his clandestine ETH mining efforts, apparently. The company admitted that the executive had secretly \u201Cbuilt a private indoor golf driving range in the management facility,\u201D where he practiced his golfing techniques \u201Cuntil late at night.\u201D This was also a source of noise that disrupted employees who were trying to rest at the facility after late-night overtime shifts. ","CCTV footage published by the news agency Yonhap also showed the executive cutting up turf from the company\u2019s lawn and loading it into his car. The executive then reportedly proceeded to replant the stolen grass in the garden of his own house.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 SIM Swaps, Other Crypto-related Crimes Set to Rise in South Korea, Says SK\n\u2013 Grassroots Sports Body Accountancy Chief Says She Stole Public Funds to Pay for Bitcoin\n\n\u2013 Brazilian Cop Charged with Duping 23 Fellow Officers in \u2018Crypto Pyramid Scam\u2019\n\u2013 \u2018Pig Butchering\u2019 Crypto Investment Scams Delivered \u2018Massive Losses\u2019 to Victims\n\n\u2013 Woman Gets 5-year Jail Term After Stealing USD 87K Worth of Crypto in Dating App Scam\n\u2013 \u2018Romantically Involved\u2019 USD 3.8m XRP Thieves Sent to Prison for 7 Years"],"entity":[{"type":"Samsung","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Duping 23 Fellow Officers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hyundai Motor","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lotte","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD 87K Worth of Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pig Butchering\u2019 Crypto Investment Scams Delivered \u2018Massive","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yonhap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fair Trade Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"LG","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crime","Ethereum","Mining","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
