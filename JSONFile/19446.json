The report notes that the potential for tokenization via blockchain is transformative, yet the technology is still not at the point of mass adoption. While this may be the case, industry experts believe that artificial intelligence (AI) solutions could push tokenized RWA use cases forward.","","RWA tokenization has been a long-time concept and dates back to 2018 when security token offerings (STOs) were all the rage. Fortunately, today\u2019s tokenized RWAs differ from previously seen STOs, which were largely unregulated.","Dave Hendricks, CEO and Co-founder of Vertalo, told Cryptonews that RWAs now have a degree of tangibility.","\u201CIf a custodian can\u2019t hold on to the asset legally, and if it\u2019s not considered a high-quality liquid asset by banks for international settlements, then some might not even consider that an RWA asset in the traditional sense,\u201D explained Hendricks.","The Struggle Is Real\u2026IMO RWA are real, hard assets and those would include anything that could be considered HQLA 1 or 2 under BIS's Basel III, but not limited to those.","Custodians hold all kinds of physical and non-physical assets. So my definition considers and includes Art\u2026","\u2014 Dave Hendricks (@davehendricks) May 7, 2024","","Hendricks added that Vertalo \u2013 a digital transfer agent and enterprise software platform \u2013 has been tokenizing RWAs since 2018. According to Hendricks, tokenization use cases are an important part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.","He noted that use cases like stablecoins differ from tokenizing valuable and scarce assets like art, diamonds, or real estate.","\u201CAssets like art, diamonds or even real estate can now be fractionalized via tokenization,\u201D said Hendricks. \u201CInvestors can now own part of that asset and receive income from the lease or use of the asset. When you tokenize an asset, each token represents a percentage of the asset.\u201D","","While Hendricks pointed out that tokenizing RWAs makes assets more easily tradable, he noted that a tangible benefit of tokenized RWAs lies in their transparency and mid\/back-office applications within the traditional asset management function.","\u201CThis is why we are now seeing large financial institutions looking at improving asset management functions using distributed ledger technology,\u201D he said.","This appears to be the case, as the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Blackrock, recently led a $47 million funding round for Securitize. The company focuses on bringing physical and traditional financial assets onto the blockchain.","Payments giant Mastercard also announced on Wednesday that it will test new distributed ledger technology to enable tokenized asset settlement between its entities. In a May 8 statement, Mastercard said the project is focused on increasing the efficiency of cross-border settlements and reducing the chance of error and fraud.","","While it\u2019s notable that the tokenization of RWAs is gaining traction, industry experts believe that AI will help advance use cases.","Meysam Alizadeh, Senior Researcher at the Digital Democracy Lab at University of Zurich and CEO of Coinfident, told Cryptonews that AI can help with RWA token trades.","For example, Alizadeh mentioned that AI can enable asset value prediction.","\u201CImagine a venture capitalist (VC) that manages multiple startups and RWAs and uses them to back a token,\u201D said Alizadeh. \u201CIn this case, given the availability of a VC\u2019s portfolio, AI can be used to predict the future values of its assets and RWAs of its startups, or to predict demand for their services.\u201D","Alizadeh added that this can help traders have a better understanding of the future valuation of a VC\u2019s portfolio.","\u201CThis could result in a better valuation of its RWA token,\u201D he said.","","To put this in perspective, Jacques Voorhees \u2013 CEO and Founder of tokenization platform RealCap \u2013 told Cryptonews that RealCap would soon be using AI to help determine the price of RWAs.","Voorhees explained that RealCap initially began tokenizing diamonds but noted that the platform now helps tokenize rare artwork and other unique assets.","\u201CWhen we started with diamonds, we didn\u2019t need to use AI for price predictions,\u201D said Voorhees. \u201CBut once RealCap began tokenizing RWAs with less available pricing information, we realized we needed an AI solution to help determine prices.\u201D","Voorhees elaborated that RealCap recently created a technology called \u201Cvirtual fungibility,\u201D allowing tokenized RWAs to be more tradable with reduced price discrepancies.","Yet he noted that virtual fungibility requires AI to determine the price of certain RWAs.","\u201CLet\u2019s say an investor wants to buy art,\u201D he said. \u201CThey can go online to different galleries, but an investor still may not know what the best price is for a piece of art. You need an objective measure. AI can help with predicative prices of each piece of art in this instance.\u201D","RealCap is currently building and developing its AI solution to ensure predictive pricing.","","Alizadeh further noted that AI could be applied to automate RWA workflow analysis.","\u201COne of the risks of RWA tokenization is smart contract bugs and vulnerabilities,\u201D he said. \u201CAI can help in two ways here \u2013 the technology can help to create reliable smart contracts, to streamline contract reviews and to detect potential bugs and compliance issues.\u201D","Natalia Karayaneva, CEO and Founder of Propy, told Cryptonews that Propy is using AI for this particular case.","Propy has been tokenizing real estate since 2018 and has conducted over $4 billion in transactions across the United States. According to Karayaneva, Propy recently began using AI to streamline transaction timelines automatically.","\u201CPropy AI can read purchase agreements, create transaction trackers, and settle intelligent deadlines for deposits, loan approvals, and more,\u201D said Karayaneva. \u201CThis level of automation ensures a smoother, secure, and more transparent property investment process, which is crucial as we integrate more into tokenized markets.\u201D","Alizadeh elaborated that AI is being applied for customer risk analysis for platforms like Propy and other tokenized RWA lending outlets.","\u201CAI can be used to evaluate the credibility of the borrower, taking into consideration the borrower\u2019s past on-chain transactions and activities,\u201D he said. \u201CThis is similar to the credit scoring system in the US, which banks use to evaluate the risk of the customers.\u201D","","While AI will likely advance tokenized RWA use cases, Alizadeh warned that challenges may hamper adoption.","For instance, he pointed out that data around the AI applications mentioned may not be easily accessible.","\u201CAI needs data to work, and limited data access decreases AI usability,\u201D he said.","Alizadeh further remarked that decentralized exchange users may not be required to undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This may result in a lack of information about a user\u2019s demographic and location, impacting a customer risk assessment AI model.","\u201CAnother data access challenge is getting all on-chain transactions of a user,\u201D added Alizadeh. \u201CSince everyone can hold multiple wallets and the identity of wallet holders is not easily verifiable, it\u2019s not easy to get all on-chain transaction history of a crypto user. Most of the solutions to these challenges may be in conflict with users\u2019 privacy and need more research to overcome.\u201D","","AI aside, Alizadeh believes that the primary challenges associated with tokenized RWAs are regulatory issues and asset verification.","\u201CTokenizing an asset, such as a building, could turn them into securities, potentially attracting strict regulatory scrutiny,\u201D Alizadeh mentioned. \u201CThis would likely decrease the incentives of RWA tokens.\u201D","He added that the verifiable authenticity of the assets underpinning RWA tokens remains problematic.","\u201CCrypto traders often express skepticism about the validity of claims concerning a token\u2019s real-world backing asset,\u201D he remarked.","With these challenges in mind, Hendricks explained that tokenized RWAs must be carefully structured to be successful.","For example, he noted that most tokenized RWAs in DeFi are debt or loan instruments.","\u201CMany if not most RWA offerings are just loans where investors put in collateral and get paid back an interest rate,\u201D Hendricks said. \u201CThis is very lightly regulated and anyone can participate in this model. However, there may be recourse if collateral is lost and value declines.\u201D","Hendricks added that a security can be created from a tokenized RWA if the underlying asset has a secured interest.","\u201CFor example, if a startup is raising money to buy an asset and fractionalize it under Reg D requirements, it can generally be sold to accredited investors,\u201D he said. \u201CYou would then have to go through KYC and AML procedures, which would create a significant speed bump. RWA by itself doesn\u2019t solve this, unfortunately.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Meysam Alizadeh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jacques Voorhees","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Voorhees","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$4 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Digital Democracy Lab at University of Zurich","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blackrock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Karayaneva","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Karayaneva","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2030","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Citi","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Natalia Karayaneva","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$5 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mastercard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Basel III","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dave Hendricks","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hendricks","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Alizadeh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hendricks","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Propy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 7, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$47 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Real World Assets","RWA","Tokenization"],"authors":["Rachel Wolfson"]}
