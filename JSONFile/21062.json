The court at the time heard that the unnamed accused attacked his (also unnamed) lover (aged in her 20s) in November 2021 while under the influence of narcotics. The man\u2019s lover, the court heard, had approached the CEO telling him she wanted to end their relationship.","Newspim reported that the CEO\u2019s legal team had pleaded for the crime to be downgraded to manslaughter, stating that he was \u201Cmentally and physically weak\u201D at the time of the crime, and told the court that he \u201Chad been receiving psychiatric treatment for a long time.\u201D","\u201CWhile receiving psychiatric treatment,\u201D the defense claimed, the CEO had \u201Ccomplained of lethargy and expressed difficulty in controlling his impulses.\u201D","But the appeals court judge at the Seoul High Court rejected the claim. The judge stated that the CEO was working in the high-pressure field of \u201Cvirtual currency at the time of the crime.\u201D","The judge said:","\u201CIt seems that the defendant was in possession of normal judgmental abilities in relation to his work in the cryptoasset sector.\u201D","The court also heard evidence that the man attacked his lover with a knife before eventually pushing her to her death, stabbing her multiple times.","The CEO, the court heard, first attacked the woman with the knife. But when she screamed during this gruesome attack, he drew her toward the window \u201Cin an effort to prevent people from realizing what he was doing.\u201D He then pushed her from the window, in an apparent bid to make the death look like an accident.","In sentencing, the judge stated:","\u201CThe defendant was in full control of his actions at the time of the incident. It doesn\u2019t seem like his actions were impeded in any way [by his mental or physical state]. The crime committed by the accused is murder, and the punishment must be severe.\u201D","The CEO was also fined $2,350. The court also heard that the man had developed a \u201Cserious\u201D drug habit and had taken narcotics including ketamine."],"entity":[{"type":"Seoul High Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2,350","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Legal","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
