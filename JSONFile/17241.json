The coin is currently about $15 short of its 30-day moving average.","This is likely due to a recent selloff, as indicated by the fact that BCH\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) is 37 and falling, just 7 points short of being oversold.","","Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) and original Bitcoin ($BTC) are family. In fact, they were technically the same thing before 2017.","However, that year, Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade called¬†Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91.¬†","The faction that forked from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was in favor of larger block sizes, which reduced fees and allowed the network to process more transactions per second.","Although, bigger block sizes mean miners need more power to do their business.","This makes mining only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations.","The added speed enabled Bitcoin Cash to become the cryptocurrency of utility for the big block supporters, who see Bitcoin primarily as a means of payments.","Original Bitcoin maxis see Bitcoin more as a store of value.","","With a $9 billion market cap, Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) is so firmly entrenched in the crypto market now that it\u2019s hard to see a future where it delivers the returns of newer offerings.","There are many Web3 platforms and applications that hint at a glowing and prosperous future for crypto beyond simply payments or storing value. One such application is the world of GambleFi.","GambleFi is one sector that\u2019s getting more of a look-in nowadays. The term refers to any crypto-native online gambling platform or product.","According to¬†data by Statista, online gambling is projected to take in $100.90 billion in revenue this year.
