But it later emerged that Sun had been gazumped with a last-gasp bid from an unknown buyer who is yet to come forward.","As previously reported, Christie\u2019s Noah Davis explained that a \u201Chandful of really dogged, really serious clients\u201D had been bidding for the non-fungible token (NFT) work, adding that \u201Cthey are mostly people who are very steeped in crypto.\u201D","Sun, however, appears incensed by the development, and took to Twitter to post a 12-part explanation of how he believes he should have become the rightful owner of the work. He alleged that an error on the Christie\u2019s system had stopped him from submitting an 11th-hour bid of his own \u2013 for a staggering USD 70 million.","Sun wrote that he was \u201Doutbid by another buyer in the last 20 secs by USD 250k. [The] difference was less than 0.3% of the total price,\u201D adding that after the late (and eventually winning bid was lodged),","\u201CI tried to update my bid to USD 70m [in] the last 30 seconds, yet my offer was somehow not accepted by Christie\u2019s system even though there was still 20 seconds left [of the auction].\u201D","He posted what he claimed was video proof of his bidding activity, and contacted Christie\u2019s to ask for an explanation, with what appeared to be an email from the auction house confirming that \u201Cunfortunately\u201D his \u201Cbid did not reach\u201D the auction house\u2019s \u201Cbidding system in time.\u201D","The Tron chief said he was not prepared to bear a grudge about the matter, adding,","\u201CI respect Christie\u2019s rules, and it was just unfortunate that we were not familiar with these terms hence lost the bid. I believe when the leading bidder gets outbid during the last few secs, they should get at least 90 seconds [to have the] chance to place one more bid. [\u2026] My commitment and investment to art and NFT [and] to the Tron community won\u2019t stop here. And I\u2019m dedicated to finding the next Beeple and the next visionary digital artist!\u201D","He also claimed that Christie\u2019s would benefit from making use of blockchain technology to avoid issues like these in the future \u2013 and naturally offered to \u201Chelp\u201D with \u201Cincorporating blockchain technology to\u201D the auction house\u2019s system.","Elsewhere on Twitter, sharp-witted crypto-keen observers came up with alternative plans of action for the Tron chief.","And as for Beeple, perhaps Sun will be interested in the artist\u2019s latest project\u2026","____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Justin Sun, Sina Estavi & Co Race to Buy NFT of Jack Dorsey\u2019s First Tweet\n\u2013 Justin Sun Denies Bid to Enlist 13.6m-sub YouTuber as Tron \u2018Shill\u2019\n\u2013 Second-Hand NFT Market for NBA Top Shot Packs Appears on eBay\n\u2013 Consider These Legal Questions Before Spending Millions on NFTs\n\u2013 NFT Overtakes Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and XRP on Google\n\u2013 Grimes and Paris Hilton Go Full NFT \u2013 But Some Warn of Trouble Ahead\n\u2013 Check These 4 Make-Your-Own-NFT Platforms\n\u2013 Non-Fungible 2021: Prepare Your NFTs For DeFi, Staking, and Sharing\n\u2013 \u2018Traditional\u2019 Art vs. Crypto Art: How to Value It\n\u2013 NFT: Can Burning A Banksy Make It More Valuable?"],"entity":[{"type":"Christie\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"First Tweet\n\u2013 Justin Sun","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paris","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"gasp","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Justin Sun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last 30 seconds","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Beeple","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sina Estavi & Co Race to Buy NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Christie\u2019s Noah Davis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NBA Top Shot Packs Appears","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grimes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Christie","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last 20","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Art","Justin Sun","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Tron"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
