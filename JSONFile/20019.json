He meditated, took shrooms on a rooftop, and flew to Bahrain for a Formula 1 event.","Zhu, on the other hand, took a different approach. ","He initially started playing a lot of video games, as he mentioned in a December tweet. He then started hanging out with surfers and UFC fighters. ","After returning home to his mansion in Singapore, he and his wife installed a permaculture farm in their backyard with ducks, chickens, and dragonflies, the report said.","It is worth noting that the Three Arrows founders have been working on OPNX, dubbed Open Exchange, an exchange for trading crypto-related bankruptcy claims.","However, the platform has faced regulatory scrutiny in Dubai, where regulators have sent a written reprimand to Davies and Zhu for promoting OPNX without the necessary local license."," "],"entity":[{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kyle Davies","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bahrain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Malaysia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Su Zhu","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hemingway","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$30 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bali","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thailand","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$35.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"British Virgin Islands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"UFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Davies","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Three Arrows Capital"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
