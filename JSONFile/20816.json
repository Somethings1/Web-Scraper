The ETFs themselves have seen $12.2 billion of net flows since launch.","However, ETF flows have stagnated over the past month, while Bitcoin has mostly traded sideways between $60,000 and $70,000. Volatility in the stock market spurred by geopolitical instability in the Middle East also affected the crypto market.","Similarly to Schiff, lead Glassnode analyst James Check said last week that the Bitcoin market could turn \u201Ctop-heavy\u201D if the price declines below $58,800. This level represents the \u201Cshort-term holder cost basis\u201D \u2013 the entry point of many recent Bitcoin buyers, and a point at which they\u2019ll panic sell if that price is lost.","Regardless, Check expects that cost-basis to hold as a line of support.","\u201CIf we assume this is a resilient uptrend, we should expect the short-term holder cost basis to hold, somewhere in that $58,000 to $59,000 region,\u201D he said at the time.","Schiff has rarely been positive about Bitcoin, prompting crypto bulls to mock the investor for years. He argues that Bitcoin cannot be used as money since it has no non-monetary use case, unlike gold, which can be used in jewelry and for industrial purposes.","Following last week\u2019s Bitcoin \u201Chalving,\u201D the digital asset\u2019s inflation rate fell decisively under that of gold, arguably making it a better store of value for holders than the precious metal.","Schiff, as always, expressed skepticism.","\u201CI think halving is an appropriate name for what\u2019s happening as soon #Bitcoin HODLers will experience a halving of their net worths,\u201D he said."],"entity":[{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Check","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$59,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 24, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Peter Schiff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoiners","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$58,800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"128%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$12.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$58,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$70,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"James Check","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$60K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Schiff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Peter Schiff"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
