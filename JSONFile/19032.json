This is an important consideration for coins that list on DEXs.","Locked liquidity means there is zero chance of a rug pull, where the project team steals the funds of token holders.","Forgwifhat was also fairly launched, meaning all 1 billion tokens were immediately available on the open market.","No allocation of tokens for the development team or \u201Cmarketing\u201D purposes reduces the chances of a token dump.","Frogwifhat aims to follows in the footsteps of other coins in that it is an animal with a hat on, but this time it is a Frog Wif a Beret, the beret of course being a staple of French culture.","Check out Frogwifhat on DEXTools Here","Users who are interested in taking a punt on Frogwifhat can check it out on Uniswap.","To buy, all they will need to do it connect their web3 wallet (via Ethereum), and have some ETH.","ETH can be bought on any major cryptocurrency exchange and setting up a web3 wallet (like MetaMask) is free.",""],"entity":[{"type":"$0.00000188","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.0000045","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.0018","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$0.0000026","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"last May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$FWIF","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bonk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$800,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pepe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dogwifcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3230k","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Meme coin","Pepe","pepe coin"],"authors":["Joel Frank"]}
