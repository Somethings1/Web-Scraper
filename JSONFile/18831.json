They also create and redeem their own publicly-traded shares, giving more traditional Wall Street investors and anyone with a brokerage account an onramp into to crypto investing through a regulated structure.","This last point means that investors don\u2019t have the same worries they would have buying and storing the asset directly.","Given the SEC\u2019s round of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals in January, crypto and ETF analysts are certain that spot Ethereum ETFs are next for a number of reasons.","London-based multinational Standard Chartered Bank recently suggested that approval will happen before May 23 this year. That\u2019s the day when the SEC has to give a verdict on the first recent filing for a spot Ethereum ETF. It makes sense, given the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs on its January 10 deadline this year.","However, Bitcoin was a different story because the SEC has stated before that BTC is not a security. On the topic of Ethereum\u2019s classification, the regulator has been more ambiguous. If the SEC views Ethereum as a security, there would be more hurdles to approve ETFs, since the SEC would claim much greater oversight on the underlying asset.","Another potential spanner in the works arrived last month. Prometheum, the only SEC-approved crypto company in the US, announced it\u2019s launching its first crypto product in late March: Ether custody.","Analysts Prometheum\u2019s gambit may finally compel the SEC into clarifying whether or not it views Ethereum as a security."],"entity":[{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 23 this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Proto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 13","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Terence Tsao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Silverman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"David Silverman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Arbitrum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dencun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Standard Chartered Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Dencun","ETF","Ethereum"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
