After ADA failed to push back above its 21DMA in the $0.52s, sell pressure has picked up.","As per CoinGecko, ADA\u2019s market cap was last around $17.8 billion. That ranks it as the 11th largest by market cap, behind Toncoin (TON) and Dogecoin (DOGE).","Both of these cryptos have market caps of $19.8 and $23.2 billion respectively.","Despite Tuesday\u2019s decline, ADA is still up 25% versus recent lows. The crypto is still down over 20% monthly and more than 15% yearly, however.","Indeed, Cardano has fallen behind other major cryptos in recent months.","While the Cardano price is down 15% in the past 90 days, Bitcoin (BTC) is up 57%. Ether (ETH), BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL), meanwhile, are up between 40-100% over the same time period.","All of this is probably explained by the fact that Cardano is struggling to achieve real-world adoption.","So, should investors dump all their holdings and switch to other cryptocurrencies?","On-chain metrics demonstrate how Cardano is failing to attract a real base of crypto users.","The blockchain has just $416 million in total value locked (TVL), as per DeFi Llama.","That compares to well over $10 billion locked on the Solana blockchain, one of its major competitors.","Indeed, despite ranking as the 11th largest crypto by market cap, Cardano ranks as the 24th by TVL.","Moreover, comparisons of daily transaction counts paint an equally grim picture.","According to Messari data, Cardano rarely sees over 100,000 transactions on a given day. On the other hand, Bitcoin has seen between 300,000 and 750,000 daily transactions in the past year, according to Ycharts.","Cardano is a smart-contract-enabled blockchain that is attempting to house a vibrant web3 ecosystem. So, better comparisons would likely be made with Ethereum or Solana.","Based on this comparison, Cardano fares are even worse. Ethereum normally sees over 1 million daily transactions, as per Ycharts. Solana, meanwhile, typically sees 15-30 million.","It\u2019s no wonder that Cardano\u2019s critics continue to refer to it as a \u201Cghost chain.\u201D","Same repetitive but useless slogan of Cardanzos: DYOR","I did.","50K active users daily max\n4.4M wallets\n350M TVL\n88M transactions\n200M liquidity in USDM\n\u2026 this is RIDICULOUS","Tell me something I don't know and that changes my mind. Cardano is a ghost chain.","\u2014 Hossa 182 (@182Hossa) April 18, 2024","","As long as this narrative of failure to attract adoption persists, Cardano is likely to continue struggling to keep pace with its major peers.","Bitcoin could be on course to hit $100,000 this year, amid slower supply growth post-halving and continued ETF demand.","The ADA\/BTC exchange rate could soon fall back to its late 2019\/202 lows around 0.000004.","That\u2019s not to say the ADA price will continue to fall in USD. But without faster adoption, it may struggle to push back above $1 in this bull market.","All that being said, the blockchain has dozens of ambitious projects vying to attract users. If any of these projects should at some point start to catch on, Cardano\u2019s fortunes could change.","üßµ1\/6 \u2013 It's confirmed.
