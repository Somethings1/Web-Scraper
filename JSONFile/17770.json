Because Congress is inept and because @GaryGensler is a bad faith regulator pursuing a political agenda, Coinbase is hoping to achieve regulatory clarity\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/Udv2swSdjz","\u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) April 15, 2024","","The SEC originally sued Coinbase in June 2023 for allegedly violating U.S. securities laws by operating as an unregistered crypto trading platform.","The crypto exchange attempted to dismiss the commission\u2019s case against it, but U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla denied Coinbase\u2019s motion to do so just last month.","\u201C@GaryGensler and the SEC have demonstrated that they are not interested in protecting small investors and operate only to serve their political masters,\u201D Deaton continued. \u201CCoinbase and its lawyers must serve the interests of employees and shareholders. The customers, who don\u2019t own shares in $COIN, deserve a voice. I will continue to be that voice.\u201D","The digital asset community has long reproached the SEC for its enforcement-focused approach to crypto regulation, filing lawsuits against key industry players, including Ripple, Binance, and others.","Earlier this month, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce criticized her own agency during the Practicing Law Institute\u2019s annual \u201CSEC Speaks\u201D event for its supposed mistreatment of the digital asset sector, claiming its heavy-handed approach to regulation is \u201Cscaring people off.\u201D"," \u201CThe Commission\u2019s announcement of a large ramp-up in its cyber-and crypto-enforcement unit, repeated assertions that the crypto industry is lawless, and treatment of cyber-incidents as fertile ground for enforcement actions add to these fears,\u201D Pierce said.","The SEC and Coinbase were widely reported to be heading to trial this spring over the litigation. The crypto platform\u2019s recent appeal may be a crucial turning point while slowing the legal battle entirely. "],"entity":[{"type":"April 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John E Deaton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2nd Circuit Court of Appeals","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"spring","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Deaton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elizabeth Warren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hester Pierce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Pierce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Katherine Polk Failla","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$COIN","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"The Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Because Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John Deaton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","John Deaton","SEC Chair"],"authors":["Julia Smith"]}
