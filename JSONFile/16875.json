Yet the scope does not refer to private or permissioned networks, so still appears to be wider than lobbyists had requested.","The text, circulated privately to the bloc\u2019s member governments by Spain, which is currently chairing talks, shows the law \u201Cupdated according to the provisional political agreement reached\u201D at a June 27 meeting, which it says \u201Ccame to an agreement on all political issues and successfully closed the negotiations\u201D in talks with lawmakers at the European Parliament.","In a statement issued Monday after publication of this story, signatories to the industry open letter said they \"regret\" that the regulation still covers smart contracts, rather than digital contracts, as the \"distinction between the two terms is significant.\"","\"We remain cautious about potential unintended implications in future regulatory proposals,\" the statement said, adding that \"forcing an intermediary in a disintermediated environment does not necessarily enhance technology security but introduces new risks.\"","To pass into law, the text must be formally agreed by the parliament and then by governments, who meet in a body known as the Council of the EU.","Signatories to the June open letter said the plans could prove unworkable and betray the purpose of permissionless networks where nobody is in charge. The commission has denied it would make existing contracts illegal.","Read more: EU Commission Brushes Off 'Data Act' Fears by Crypto Industry","UPDATE (July 17, 18:09 UTC): Adds response from signatories.","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"European Parliament","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Industry","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Union Data Act","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Spain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 27","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July 17","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","EU","smart contracts","Data","EU Parliament"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
