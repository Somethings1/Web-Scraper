The original fight against the middlemen who are rent-seeking. Crypto is the same ethos. Wu-Tang Clan was prescient in understanding that conflict,\u201D said Jamis Johnson, Chief Pleasing Officer at PleasrDaO, in a video yesterday.","In an interview with the New York Times, Johnson added that the album was created as some form of \u201Cprotest against rent-seeking middlemen, people who are taking a cut away from the artist. Crypto very much shares that same ethos.\u201D","Per The Times, a non-fungible token (NFT) of the album has been created to designate ownership of the physical copy. All the 74 members of PleasrDAO jointly share ownership of that NFT, and thus they collectively own the album. ","Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s album was previously owned by Martin Shkreli, an infamous hedge fund manager who was convicted of fraud. After being arrested on charges of extensive securities fraud, the US government obtained the album as part of Shkreli\u2019s monetary judgment. ","In late July, however, the US Justice Department announced that the album has been sold but did not disclose the buyer and the price paid citing a \u201Cconfidentiality provision.\u201D","\u201CAfter nearly a decade under wraps and in private hands, PleasrDAO purchased the complete album, with plans to oversee and fulfill Wu\u2019s original vision. Bring da motherfuckin\u2019 ruckus,\u201D PleasrDAO said in a blog post. ","Cilvaringz, producer and conceptualizer of \u201COnce Upon A Time In Shaolin,\u201D told PleasrDAO:","\u201CThe single copy concept\u2019s primary intention was to incentivize a debate about the perception of music as an art form and how its monetary and experiential values were being smothered by digitization. Seven years later, the NFT suddenly achieved to secure these values. At the very least, this album has encouraged the journey towards this solution for digitizable art forms.\u201D","____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 This Is How DAOs Are Taking A Greater Role in the DeFi and NFT Sectors\n\u2013 Evaluating NFTs: How to Know Whether an NFT Project is Legit\n\n\u2013 This Is How NFTs Might Change TV and Film Industries\n\u2013 American Music Producer Makes USD 11.7M in NFT Sales",""],"entity":[{"type":"Jamis Johnson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tang Clan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Johnson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"multisig DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US Justice Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Martin Shkreli","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT Project","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"OG NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["DAO","Decentralization","Investing","Music","NFT","Non-fungible tokens"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
