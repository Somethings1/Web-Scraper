Also, the cETNs must meet all the requirements of the UK Listing Regime in prospectuses and disclosures.","The regulator\u2019s decision to allow cETN applications follows US approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has led to significant success and a surge in Bitcoin prices.","Also on Monday, the London Stock Exchange said it would accept applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs in the second quarter of 2024.","The country has been reluctant to approve retail access to these products, leaving it somewhat isolated compared to other major global markets.","In 2020, the FCA banned UK firms from offering or selling crypto derivatives and ETNs over reasons including market volatility. It maintains that these carry significant risks for retail consumers, leading to potential harm. Consequently, their sale remains prohibited.","\u201CThe FCA continues to remind people that cryptoassets are high risk and largely unregulated. Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money,\u201D the regulator warned.","In its regulatory efforts concerning crypto, the UK has adopted a two-part strategy.","In October, the Treasury unveiled comprehensive proposals aimed at regulating fiat-backed stablecoins, particularly focusing on their use in payment systems.","This initial step represents the beginning of their regulatory agenda, with future plans to extend regulatory oversight to the wider cryptocurrency sector, which will be detailed in separate policy documents."],"entity":[{"type":"the Financial Conduct Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the London Stock Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UK Listing Regime","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"second quarter of 2024","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["ETFs","FCA","UK"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
