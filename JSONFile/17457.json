(@ParikPatelCFA) May 13, 2024","","Regardless of whether Gill actually begins another crusade, traders have pre-empted any possible pump by buying the likeliest meme tokens to benefit from his return.","This includes DOGE, which, in the longer term, may end up benefiting massively from X\u2019s introduction of digital payments.","X has said it will introduce such payments this year, and if its options include crypto and DOGE, the latter could rocket.","If not, it may reach $0.25 by the end of the summer and $0.4 by the end of the year.","While DOGE could continue to gain in the near term, it arguably doesn\u2019t promise as much positive volatility as newer meme tokens, which can often outperform the market by big margins.","While picking winners in advance is often a crap shoot with very new meme coins, one way of identifying stronger candidates is to look for successful presales.","And one new meme coin with a very encouraging sale is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised over $15 million in its token offering.","As the first-ever Doge-themed multi-chain crypto, DOGEVERSE will run on Ethereum,Â Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.","By operating on multiple chains, it could gain much greater usage and traction that it would have as a single-chain coin, with the increased demand helping to push up its price.","Helping with a higher price will be its max supply of 120 million tokens, which, over time, will potentially make the coin deflationary.","Also, squeezing its supply will be the ability to stake the token, which will incentivize long-term holding on the part of owners.","","While the coin\u2019s presale will be ending soon, investors can still join its sale by going to the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE is $0.00031.","This is its final presale price, with DOGEVERSE unlikely to be available so cheaply ever again.","Buy DOGEVERSE Today",""],"entity":[{"type":"Keith Gill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"4.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"8.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$0.4","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"108%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$600 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"CFA","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"ACCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parik Patel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$0.1504","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Roaring Kitty\u2019","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$GME","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$0.25","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$0.00031","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Dogecoin","Meme Coins","Price Prediction"],"authors":["Simon Chandler"]}
