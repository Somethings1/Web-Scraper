The terms of the deal will see the DigitalBits logo displayed on the front of the first team jersey from the 2022-2023 season. The deal is due to expire in 2025. Inter has an existing relationship with DigitialBits \u2013 the company paid for sleeve sponsorship rights during the 2021-2022 season.","The crypto company has also become Inter\u2019s \u201Cofficial crypto partner.\u201D But, Italy\u2019s top footballing newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport reported that DigitalBits has not \u201Chonored\u201D a \u201Ctranche\u201D of payments to Inter \u2013 a fact that has led the relationship between the club and its main sponsor to \u201Cbecome complicated.\u201D","Both parties had denied the existence of any financial-related issues several weeks ago after rumors about a non-payment first began to circulate.","But the situation appears to have changed for the worse since then. Inter is \u201Cnot standing still,\u201D the newspaper reported. And it has responded to what now appears to be a clear non-payment by \u201Cdoing what it can do.\u201D","The club has removed most DigitalBits branding from its web-based platforms. While the firm\u2019s logo can still be seen in photos of the club\u2019s shirts, no other mention of the crypto company is now visible on Inter-related sites. The company\u2019s name has also been removed from a list of official partners on the club\u2019s website.","A friendly match held over the weekend saw the sponsor\u2019s name removed from scoreboards in the stadium, and Gazetta reported that it was \u201Clikely that it will also be the case\u201D when the team plays its next pre-season match on August 6.","Both the crypto company and the club appear keen to remain tight-lipped on the matter. The newspaper claimed that there was \u201Cno clarity\u201D on the amount of money owed in \u201Cthe overdue tranche\u201D \u2013 although everything appeared to be in order when Inter published its most recent balance sheet on June 30. This would appear to suggest that DigitalBits had honored its payment obligations up until this point.","The newspaper added that DigitalBits may have suffered financial losses due to the fact that its XDB token has struggled during the harsh crypto winter. In March, the coin was trading for almost USD 0.646, while its all-time high stands at 0.85 as recorded in November 2021, per CoinGecko data. At 13:37 UTC on August 1, however, the token is trading at USD 0.027, down 6.4% in a day, 31% in a week, 29% in a month, 76% in a year, and 97% from its all-time high.","Further repercussions are on the way, Gazzetta added: the club had been set to unveil its away jersey before August 10, but \u201Cwill in all probability\u201D postpone this to September \u2013 as it has no desire to give more \u201Cvisibility\u201D to DigitalBits before the latter honors its contract.","However, Inter\u2019s options are somewhat limited: The club has already sold thousands of DigitalBits-branded replica shirts ahead of the Serie A season opener away at Lecce on August 13.","The outlet wrote that while a \u201Cchange of sponsor\u201D at this stage would be \u201Ctremendously complicated,\u201D in \u201Cthe future, nothing can be excluded.\u201D","DigitalBits still stands to receive an enormous amount of exposure through the sponsorship deal: as well as wearing DigitalBits-branded shirts in the Serie A, Inter is also set to compete in the Champions League, Europe\u2019s premium cup competition. They are also due to defend the Coppa Italia, which they won in May \u2013 defeating perennial rivals Juventus in the final.","One journalist close to the club insisted that Inter would not be left out of pocket, however.","An Inter fansite quoted the journalist Fabrizio Biasin as stating that the club\u2019s contract with DigitalBits was \u201Carmor-clad,\u201D remarking:","\u201CWe are facing a delay, but the money will come.\u201D","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 FC Internazionale Milano and Zytara Labs Sign EUR 85m Partnership Agreement with Support from DigitalBits Foundation\n\u2013 Crypto Exchanges Backing Away from Sports Spending as Crunch Continues\n\n\u2013 Ukrainian Crypto Exchange Reportedly Close to FC Barcelona Sleeve Sponsorship Deal\n\u2013 Chelsea Secures First Crypto Shirt Sponsor in USD 24M Deal\n\n\u2013 Liverpool FC Mull Bid to Ditch TradFi for Crypto Firm in Shirt Sponsorship Deal\n\u2013 Brazilian Football Powerhouse São Paulo FC Lets Fans Buy Tickets Using Bitcoin, Crypto\n\n\u2013 New York Yankees\u2019 Bitcoin Deal\n\u2013 Binance Scores Ronaldo"],"entity":[{"type":"FC Internazionale Milano","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DigitalBits Foundation\n\u2013 Crypto Exchanges Backing Away","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"76%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Champions League","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"São Paulo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gazzetta dello Sport","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"29%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Gazetta","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Internazionale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Italy","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gazzetta","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lecce","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Milan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Inter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"6.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"FC Barcelona Sleeve Sponsorship Deal\n\u2013 Chelsea Secures First Crypto Shirt Sponsor","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"31%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"97%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crunch Continues\n\n\u2013 Ukrainian Crypto Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August 13","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coppa Italia","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fabrizio Biasin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ronaldo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto\n\n\u2013 New York Yankees","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zytara Labs Sign EUR 85m Partnership Agreement","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Exchange","Marketing","Sport"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
