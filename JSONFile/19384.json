As crypto markets scour for the most promising coins for the year ahead, investors are increasingly looking to small cap crypto coins for the biggest growth opportunities before the Bitcoin Halving event \u2013 here\u2019s a run down of the top 5.","Small cap crypto coins refer to cryptocurrency projects that offer an alluringly low market cap, this is critical for identifying opportunities for the biggest gains.","To illustrate, for an investor to make a 3x return on Bitcoin in 2024, the total Bitcoin market cap needs to grow from a whopping $862,838,295,735 (over $800bn) to an eye-watering $2,588,514,887,205 (over $2.5tn).","Whereas for an investor to make a 3x return on a micro cap such as BRC-20 based OrdiZK ($OZK), the market cap simply needs to grow from $5,260,000 to $15,780,000 \u2013 a much easier move.","However, there is a trade-off between the high growth of market caps, and the higher risk of failure amongst smaller projects.","This leaves investors targeting so-called small cap crypto coins, which offer a balance between market position and low market cap growth potential.","Kick-starting our list is the Ethereum Name Service\u2019s token ENS, which has enjoyed a strong resurgence into 2024, growing 88.6% over the past 3-months \u2013 leaving the token on the verge of breaking into the top 100 at #136 (cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap).","","ENS token is a governance token that manages the treasury of the ENS DAO, which has been established to run and govern the ENS Protocol \u2013 which is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20).","With a market cap of $440,626,067, ENS token would require market cap growth to just under $1.5bn to mount a 3x return.","Next on the list is Tellor Tributes (TRB), which emerged as one of the largest breakout coins in the end of 2023 rally \u2013 mounting an explosive multi-month move that has left TRB trading on a +122.48% 3-month gain.","","TRB token forms the backbone of the Tellor Tributes ecosystem, which operates oracles supplying data-feeds for smart contract interactions at a fraction of the cost of top oracle project Chainlink (LINK).","Despite recent breakout success, TRB\u2019s market remains low at $296,041,585, suggesting that Tellor Tribute\u2019s market cap only needs to grow to $900m to lock-in a 3x return for investors (easily achievable with reference to top oracle Chainlink\u2019s $8bn market cap).","In third place is SingularityNET (AGIX), which is building on the hype and promise of 2023\u2019s high-octane AI narrative, which saw major AI cryptocurrencies explode with the growth of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.","March\u2019s AI narrative saw AGIX pump an impressive +106%, however, months since have seen AGIX enter retracement \u2013 offering an alluring opportunity to investors bullish on AI.","","Despite this retracement, AGIX has entered 2024 in fashion, with a multi-month pump posting a respectable +57.7% gain over the past 3-months.","Looking at SingularityNET\u2019s growth potential, with a current market cap of $360,140,758, in order to achieve a 3x growth AGIX only needs to grow to just over $1bn \u2013 a feasible move in face of the advent of AI.","Landing in second place for best crypto 2024 is Conflux Network (CFX), which undertook a wave of growth at the start of 2023 amid the hysteria of the so-called \u2018Chinese Narrative\u2019 \u2013 which swept through the market as regulators in Hong Kong pushed to create an American-alternative global crypto hub.","Standing as the only fully-regulator compliant Chinese cryptocurrency, Conflux Network has been pivotal in granting public access for Chinese investors to major decentralized utilities such as Uniswap v3 and the CNH (offshore Chinese Yuan) stablecoin.","","With Asian trading volumes growing by the day, Chinese investors already mount an impressive $86.4 billion in crypto trading volume, and this is matched by a further $64 billion volume from Hong Kong \u2013 highlighting the opportunity for Conflux.","Looking at Conflux\u2019s growth potential, CFX currently has a market cap of $643,050,642, this means for CFX to undertake a 3x return the market cap would need to grow to an attainable $1,929,151,926.","Coming in at the top of our list as the best crypto 2024 is Rocketpool (RPL), which is a leading project in the promising liquid staking derivatives (LSD) sector.","Rocketpool enables Ethereum holders with less than the validator requirement of 32 ETH (worth $71,760) the ability to pool together to operate as a validator on the Ethereum proof-of-stake network \u2013 thus accessing higher levels of staking reward.","","RPL token is the heart of this network, not only functioning as a governance token, but also acting as an insurance for users against slashing penalties for downtime on the node.","With a present market cap of $595,106,636, in order for RPL to achieve a 3x return the market cap needs to grow to $1,785,319,908 \u2013 easily achievable with reference to Ethereum\u2019s total market cap of $269,798,018,229.","While small cap crypto coins offer the best balance between risk and growth potential, micro cap projects still take the cake for the largest growth opportunity \u2013 however, cutting through the fundamentals to identify low-risk plays is more of an art than a science.","One such opportunity, emerges in an explosive new meme coin called Meme Kombat \u2013 which could become the best crypto 2024.","","Meet¬†Meme Kombat, a trailblazing initiative that has seamlessly blended the memetic love of nostalgic gaming, and GambleFi, into a decentralized Web3 platform.","So, what makes Meme Kombat tick, and why should potential investors keep a keen
