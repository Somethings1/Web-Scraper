However, the market is now seemingly trying to recover, leaving almost USD 4bn worth of trading positions (more than 620,000 traders) in the crypto derivatives market liquidated in the past 24 hours. Over USD 1.5bn of these were in BTC, per bybt.com data. This comes after USD 10bn was liquidated this past Sunday.","In total, almost USD 19bn worth of trading positions were liquidated in the past seven days.","As is always the case during similar market corrections, there are those who see the market bears everywhere and those, who claim that the bulls are still here.","\u201CDon\u2019t listen to BTC bulls. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve closed below the 50 [moving average] since [USD] 10500,\u201D said \u2018TurnipShortLife\u2019, but posts like these tend to provoke arguments over what \u2018closing\u2019 means in a 24\/7 market.","And while levels of USD 46,000 and as low as USD 40,000 are being mentioned, comparing this bull run with the one in 2017, some find that larger drawbacks may be yet to come.","Yup\u2026 makes you wonder if we're gonna nuke harder the following days. But $ETH just might pull everything out of this mess.https:\/\/t.co\/6tffaCUPl6","However, it seems that the general consensus is that the bull market is still here.","Meanwhile, among the reasons behind the drop, are the USD 1.55bn worth of options expiring today, and US President Joe Biden\u2019s reportedly proposed tax plan, insiders say.","According to the global payment network Mercuryo Co-founder and CEO, Petr Kozyakov, \u201Cthe market appears to be reacting irrationally to the news with sell-offs\u201D and \u201Cthe dip may continue but bitcoin will form strong support at [USD] 45,000 while looking forward to recovery to its previous [all-time high].\u201D","BTC hit its all-time high of USD 64,805 on April 14, per Coingecko.","\u201CThe deep correction has shaken the confidence of the cryptocurrency market,\u201D said analysts at crypto exchange OKEx, adding that the price of BTC has finally hit an area of presumed buying interest. While traders eager to long \u201Cwould be attempting to catch a knife,\u201D many experienced traders won\u2019t be too eager to short at this stage.","This is \u201Cjust another day in crypto,\u201D added OKEx CEO Jay Hao, urging people to stay calm, trade responsibly, and build a position over time.","\u201CThe Coinbase listing was a crescendo and drove tremendous institutional and retail interest. Since then, there has been a lack of continual buyers. Therefore, one could argue that a healthy correction was necessary,\u201D Alex Zhao, CEO of Standard Hashrate Group, said in an emailed comment, adding that BTC will continue to attract institutional interest.","Many more commenters, developers, and analysts seem to believe that the market is in a \u201Cresting\u201D period.","For trader Michaël van de Poppe, this is an expected stage of \u201Ccalm\u201D for BTC after running from USD 10,000 to USD 60,000 without breaks. He said this a \u201Cgreat\u201D time to buy the dip, or remain calm if you\u2019re holding positions.","Not only that, but many claim that the bull will keep running. \u201CThis is just turbulence,\u201D said trader Teddy Cleps. \u201CConfident the bull market is nowhere to be done \u2013 still loads to go.\u201D","the bull market isn\u2019t over you dorks relax and have a beer or something","\u201CMarket participants suffer from 2018 [post-traumatic stress disorder],\u201D said trader Alex Krüger. While the possible US tax changes are bearish, they\u2019re still being discussed, are far ahead, and should have been expected as a part of Biden\u2019s plan, he argued. Krüger doubts that we\u2019re heading for a 2018-like correction, adding: \u201CIf can\u2019t hold a correction, maybe good idea to take some profits next time.\u201D","And while many are reminded of pullbacks seen in 2017\/2018, others are trying to put the current dip into perspective, compared to those that preceded it.","Look what happened next pic.twitter.com\/QuNwsbVKP5","Others are showing it from a different point of view, noting how much BTC has appreciated in a short time, compared to which the recent drop is much smaller. On April 23 last year, BTC was trading at USD 7,700. It went up 603% to reach the current price.","\u201CWe are approaching a bottom in the short-mid-term for this current correction and are just waiting for profit taking to reset and a general shift of coins from weak to strong hands. The exact timeline for this is never predictable, but as macro cycle indicators show, we are far from the top,\u201D Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital wrote in his newsletter today, stressing that \u201Cthere are currently over 50,000 new entities a day coming onto the [Bitcoin] blockchain.\u201D","On Krüger\u2019s question to the public which coin would bounce the hardest, many nominated major coins like ETH, binance coin (BNB), solana (SOL), chainlink (LINK), uniswap (UNI), as well as \u201Csome illiquid shitcoin that goes to almost 0.\u201D","Meanwhile, a coming upgrade is expected to reduce the supply of ETH, which could help boost the price. Per Bitfinex\/Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino, \u201CEthereum is getting a bit of the spotlight,\u201D and its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the non-fungible token (NFT) market are worth noting too.","Konstantin Anissimov, Executive Director at crypto exchange CEX.IO, said that USD 3,000 level for ETH is \u201Cmore achievable than ever.\u201D","ETH hit its new all-time high of USD 2,640 (per Coingecko) yesterday.\n__","______","The markets are just a giant Ouija board, with all of our hands on the slider.","__","Agree 100% that the real bear market haven't even started.
