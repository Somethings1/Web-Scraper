USD 2.82 and is down by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, trimming its weekly gains to 3.6%. The price is down by 29% in the past month, but is up by 134% in a year.","After peaking at USD 5.3 in August, HT is down 47%. Losses in November were steep, as shown by the arrangement of daily chart candlesticks. Before this week\u2019s recovery, candlesticks were banding along the lower band of the Bollinger Band, a widely used technical indicator, revealing weakness.","This week Huobi showed more signs that it may finally be returning to the fold in China, over two years after a Beijing crypto crackdown forced domestic trading platforms out of the country. Huobi China has joined a state-endorsed blockchain alliance named the Blockchain Services Network. The network plans to offer blockchain infrastructural services to local or international entities.","According to Matthew Graham, CEO of the advisory company Sino Global Capital, Huobi and OKEx, a competing crypto exchange originally from China but now based in Malta, have now some \u201Clevel of institutionalization\u201D in China, while several trading platforms have halted operations or announced they will no longer serve domestic users as the country started a new crackdown on crypto trading.","According to Graham, \u201Cit\u2019s been well understood for some time that Huobi and OKEx have substantially better relationships with Chinese government than Binance.\u201D Earlier, it was widely reported that the police had \u201Craided\u201D Binance offices in Shanghai, a claim that was dismissed by Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance. Moreover, as reported, Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like service, suspended Binance\u2019s account.","Meanwhile, OKB, the native token of OKEx, shows mixed results as multiple market data aggregators provide contradicting data about this token. E.g., it\u2019s ranked 17th by market capitalization at Coingecko and 1,816th at Coinpaprika, while its weekly price change range from -19% (Messari) to +11% (Coingecko)."],"entity":[{"type":"Weibo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bollinger Band","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Huobi Global","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"3.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"+11%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"134%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sino Global Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"29%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Graham","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"-19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"47%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Matthew Graham","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Beijing","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Coinpaprika","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blockchain Services Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Malta","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Huobi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["China","Exchange","Market"],"authors":["Dalmas Ngetich"]}
