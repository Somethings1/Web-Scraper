But one form of cryptocurrency, called stablecoins, aims to provide refuge to those who want to exit constant volatility while still staying in the crypto market.","Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are supposed to be pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. In the cases of USD-pegged stablecoins, their prices are supposed to be $1 at all times.","Each stablecoin project differs in ways they maintain the peg. The two biggest ones, tether (USDT) and Circle's usd coin (USDC), are \u201Cover-collateralized\u201D by fiat reserves, meaning they have cash or cash-equivalent assets in their reserves. So each USDT or USDC traded in the crypto market is backed by what\u2019s actually in the possession of the stablecoin issuers. Similarly, MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin DAI is decentralized but also overcollateralized \u2013 backed by ether (ETH) deposited into its smart contracts.","Over the past year, however, a new form of stablecoin has emerged that differs in its collateralization: algorithmic stablecoins, such as terraUSD (UST), magic internet money (MIM), frax (FRAX) and neutrino usd (USDN).","They\u2019re called algorithmic because what backs them is an on-chain algorithm that facilitates a change in supply and demand between them (the stablecoin) and another cryptocurrency that props them up.","In the case of the Terra blockchain, which runs the largest algorithmic stablecoin platform, the algorithmic tango is performed by UST, a stablecoin, and terra (LUNA), Terra\u2019s native cryptocurrency that backs the stablecoin. For the remainder of this article, we will use \u201CLUNA\u201D to refer to terra (LUNA) to avoid any confusion.","Read More: What Is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem","Algorithmic stablecoins are typically undercollateralized \u2013 they don\u2019t have independent assets in reserves to back the value of their stablecoins. In fact, \u201Cundercollateralized stablecoins\u201D and \u201Calgorithmic stablecoins\u201D are often used interchangeably.","Algorithm can be an obfuscating word. But it simply means a set of code that instructs a process. So, for example, what you get to see on your Facebook timeline is determined by Facebook\u2019s timeline algorithms, which include things like how relevant the post is to you based on your past online behavior. In crypto, an algorithm refers to pieces of code on the blockchain, as encoded in a set of smart contracts.","Algorithmic stablecoins typically rely on two tokens \u2013 one stablecoin and another cryptocurrency that backs the stablecoins \u2013 and so the algorithm (or the smart contact) regulates the relationship between the two.","Cryptocurrencies \u2013 similar to all assets in the market, such as houses or stocks \u2013 move up and down in price depending on the market demand and the supply of the asset. This also includes stablecoins because they\u2019re essentially cryptocurrencies freely traded on the market.","To prevent the price of a stablecoin depegging \u2013 moving away from $1 \u2013 while subject to market conditions, algorithms regulate supply and demand. When there\u2019s too much demand for an asset but little supply of it, the price of that asset goes up \u2013 and vice versa.","The algorithm\u2019s promise is to keep this in check, as we explore in the context of UST in the next section, before delving deeper into how that can go terribly wrong.","TerraUSD (UST) maintains \u2013 or is supposed to maintain \u2013 its 1:1 parity with the U.S. dollar via an algorithmic relationship with Terra\u2019s native cryptocurrency, LUNA. Behind the relationship is an arbitrage opportunity that presents itself every time UST loses its peg in either direction.","When the UST supply is too small and demand for it is too high, the price of UST goes above $1. To bring UST back to its peg, the Terra protocol lets users trade 1 USD of LUNA for 1 UST at the Terra station portal. This trade burns 1 USD of LUNA and mints 1 UST, which users can sell for 1.01 USD and pocket a profit of 1 cent. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but these profits add up when done in large quantities.","Read More: Crypto Arbitrage Trading: How to Make Low-Risk Gains","Users can mint as much UST as needed from burned LUNA until UST goes back down to $1. As the supply increases, the price eventually comes down \u2013 or that\u2019s at least the logic behind it.","When the supply is too large and demand is too low, the opposite happens: The price of UST goes below $1. So the protocol lets users do the opposite as above: Users can buy 1 UST for 0.99 USD, then trade 1 UST for 1 USD of LUNA. The trade burns 1 UST and mints 1 USD of LUNA, netting the arbitrage trader a profit of .01 UST.","Again, the Terra protocol lets users continuously burn UST and receive LUNA until UST reaches $1.","The second scenario \u2013 value falling below the peg \u2013 is a more common problem for algorithmic stablecoins, as the market anxiety around them is more common than market euphoria, resulting in more instances of lower demand and higher supply.","UST\u2019s algorithmic relationship with LUNA means that the latter has to absorb the volatility of the former. Since new LUNA can be continuously minted any time UST is below $1, the price of LUNA can free-fall in the face of increasing token supply.","In response to mounting criticism that UST is in a vulnerable state with no external backing mechanism \u2013 independent collateral assets \u2013 Do Kwon, the CEO of Terra creator Terraform Labs and the main man behind UST, set up Luna Foundation Guard in February 2022, an entity in charge of maintaining the stablecoin\u2019s peg. It has \u2013 or had \u2013 a goal of buying as much as $10 billion in bitcoin (BTC) to support the peg.","First slowly, then suddenly.","UST began depegging on May 7, as large-volume withdrawals from Terra\u2019s largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Anchor began in earnest. These had a domino effect on the UST pool on Ethereum\u2019s Curve Protocol, the main hub for stablecoin liquidity in all of DeFi, which also saw high-volume withdrawals.","Some blame the events that led to UST\u2019s depegging on a coordinated attack. Others think it was a series of spontaneous panic-ridden withdrawals due to the souring wider market conditions, especially in the price of bitcoin that LFG has added to its reserve to back UST. In either case, the stablecoin hasn\u2019t withstood the pressure enough to maintain its peg, eventually falling as low as $0.29 on May 11.","Since LFG, the entity that defends UST\u2019s peg, has so much bitcoin in reserve, some analysts think it may have also fueled bitcoin\u2019s price crash, as many feared the organization could dump billions of bitcoin. But it\u2019s a double whammy: Falling bitcoin price also meant the LFG has less ammunition in its arsenal.","Read More: The LUNA and UST Crash Explained in 5 Charts","But isn\u2019t this where the algorithm should work its magic?","The algorithm, which is supposed to burn UST and mint LUNA when UST is below $1, hasn\u2019t worked as well; it\u2019s failed to keep up with the extreme conditions. According to a proposal submitted by Kwon on May 11, the algorithm couldn\u2019t facilitate the minting of new LUNAs at a speed needed to re-peg UST (it had to outrun the market speed, and it couldn\u2019t), and so a proposed change in code would alter the mint cap and speed up the algorithmic process. The proposal, if passed, would see more LUNA minted in a shorter span of time.","Defending UST means sacrificing LUNA\u2019s price since it increases LUNA\u2019s supply, and greater supply means selling pressure on a token\u2019s price. As a result, LUNA violently crashed during the night of May 11, falling more than 97% to as low as $0.88.","An elaborate explanation of the May 11 proposal states, \u201CIn extreme situations like this, Terra cannot save both UST peg, and save LUNA price at the same time.\u201D","Read More: What\u2019s the Point of Stablecoins?"],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"MIM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra Ecosystem","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"earnest","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"LUNA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Terra blockchain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Luna Foundation Guard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1 cent","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"97%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"LFG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Circle","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.88","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Terra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.29","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 11","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Learn","Intermediate","Cryptocurrency"],"authors":["Ekin Gen√ß"]}
