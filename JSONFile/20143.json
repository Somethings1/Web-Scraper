But other nations may be looking to the Central American nation with keen interest \u2013 hopeful of following suit if El Salvador\u2019s move to adopt BTC as legal tender last year pays dividends.\n\nIn a report from the Financial Times, Kevin Daly, a portfolio manager at the investment company Abrdn, was quoted as stating that \u201Cmuch to our surprise,\u201D the Salvadoran finance minister Alejandro Zelaya had \u201Csaid he had demand for up to USD 1.5bn for the bitcoin bonds\u201D \u2013 which will be used to construct a new tax-free haven for international crypto advocates and pioneers.","Regardless, Daly \u2013 like many others quoted in the report \u2013 claimed that the issuance was \u201Ca misstep\u201D on the government\u2019s part, claimed that El Salvador was \u201Cmuddling through\u201D the issuance, and opined:","\u201CIf the [government] print[s] USD 1bn, we\u2019re all going to shake our heads in amazement.\u201D","The investment firms Meketa Investment Group and NEPC also opined that demand was \u201Clikely to be muted\u201D in the institutional investment sector, \u201Cincluding pensions and endowments.\u201D The firms claimed that \u201Cretail investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts\u201D would instead snap up \u201Cthe lion\u2019s share.\u201D","As reported, Fitch already downgraded El Salvador\u2019s sovereign credit rating from a score of B- to CCC. The firm claims that adopting bitcoin as legal tender could compromise a possible USD 1.3bn financing package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).","However, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has doubled down on his bitcoin \u201Cbet\u201D \u2013 and has taken an adversarial stance to such \u201Ccautionary\u201D warnings from the IMF and other organizations such as the World Bank.","https:\/\/t.co\/s1F5kwOBEn pic.twitter.com\/LD0I2dBHha","Regardless, the report\u2019s author noted that bitcoin is not seen as a \u201Cspeculative asset\u201D in \u201Cemerging market countries,\u201D where \u201Cthe focus is on transacting.\u201D","The report quoted Lord Fusitu\u2019a, a Tongan aristocrat and ex-MP, who \u201Cis seeking to introduce a bill that could make bitcoin legal tender in Tonga as early as February 2023,\u201D as stating: \u201COur largest, most lucrative export is our people. They make more money for us than any commodity.\u201D","Meltem Demirors, the Chief Strategy Officer at the cryptoasset management firm CoinShares, was quoted as stating:","\u201CEl Salvador is a case study for other developing countries that are reliant on the World Bank and the IMF for financing.\u201D","Nations with flagging fiats and large overseas-based communities that send remittances to families based at home were identified as potential BTC adopters who may be watching events unfold in El Salvador with no shortage of interest.","Earlier this month, the government had talked up a spate of legal reforms to lay the groundwork for the bonds, as well as a possible bond issuance as early as March 20. These have failed to materialize, but Bukele and his ministers may be waiting for a more opportune moment to launch.","Much of the demand for the bonds is expected to come from overseas. But with the conflict in Ukraine grabbing most of the global headlines, Bukele likely feels that waiting could represent a wiser course of action.","Regardless, the President, who has overseen a decline in ties with Washington (and may well be seeking to de-dollarize his economy) took the time to post a sideswipe aimed at American financial chiefs to Twitter over the weekend.","The most powerful country in the world is falling so fast, that it makes you rethink what are the real reasons.\n\nSomething so big and powerful can\u2019t be destroyed so quickly, unless the enemy comes from within. https:\/\/t.co\/EAHz5nt7ec","The bitcoiner and investor Anthony Pompliano wrote that the bond issuance \u201Cappears to be setting the stage for a revolution in sovereign debt markets.\u201D\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Corporations & Countries Watch and Learn From El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Experiment\n\u2013 El Salvador Will Be a Serious Test for Bitcoin\u2019s Layer-2 Networks \n\n\u2013 BitMEX Boss: El Salvador-style Bitcoin Adoption on the Cards for 5 More Nations\n\u2013 Argentinian Senate Passes USD 45B IMF Debt Deal That Discourages Crypto Use"],"entity":[{"type":"International Monetary Fund (IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CCC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the World Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bukele","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Daly","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2013 Corporations & Countries Watch and Learn From El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Experiment\n\u2013 El Salvador","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nayib Bukele","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"World Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anthony Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NEPC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alejandro Zelaya","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kevin Daly","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fitch","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tonga","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"5 More Nations\n\u2013 Argentinian Senate Passes USD 45B IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Meketa Investment Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Anthony Pompliano","Bitcoin","El Salvador","Investing"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
