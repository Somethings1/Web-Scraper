Its price spiked 12.88% to a four-month high of $21.84.","This aligns with Ethereum\u2019s price rise following the ETF news. The potential for an Ethereum investment product has boosted sentiment around ETC.","With the Fear & Greed Index at 70, the market mood remains positive.

While not yet in oversold territory, this downward momentum indicates fading upside strength that could foreshadow additional LDO price declines.","Meanwhile, MACD continues trending upwards but its histogram narrowed from 0.028 to 0.031, highlighting slowing bullish momentum.","The LDO price has immediate support at the Fib 0.786 level of $2.279, a break below this level could turn it into resistance and open the door for a steeper drop towards the zone between $2.145 to $2.187.","However, if the $2.279 support holds, LDO could stabilize and potentially retest upside resistance between $2.407 to $2.523.","Overall, Lido DAO sits at a pivotal juncture between key support and resistance.","Prudent risk management is recommended while awaiting confirmation of the next major price trend.","A decisive breakout past $2.523 resistance or breakdown under $2.145 support should set the tone for LDO\u2019s near-term outlook.","","","After posting a strong rally over the past few weeks, Ethereum Classic (ETC) experienced its first signs of weakness today, with the ETC price pulling back from multi-month highs amidst declining momentum.","With ETC stabilizing above key support levels, technical indicators remain at a crossroads, leaving traders to ponder if this is just a temporary blip or the start of a deeper correction.","The 20-day EMA for the ETC price currently stands at $17.74, crossing above the 50-day EMA of $16.75 for the first time this year.","Typically, this golden cross is seen as a strongly bullish signal. However, with the crossover occurring so recently and the ETC price already extended, caution may be warranted.","The RSI has pulled back from yesterday\u2019s overbought reading of 80.46 down to 78.85. While still in overbought territory, this shows bullish momentum is slowing.","The MACD histogram has risen to 0.33, up from 0.27 yesterday. However, the slowing trajectory suggests upside drive may be fading.","ETC is currently trading at $20.56, down 0.58% so far today.","This places ETC just below horizontal resistance between $20.23 and $20.79, which aligns with the Fib 0.236 level at $20.79. Getting rejected in this area could signal a temporary top is in place.","On the downside, initial support comes in at the Fib 0.382 level of $19.23. If this fails to hold, ETC could quickly descend towards the 20-day EMA around $17.74 which would equate to a 14% drop from current levels.","While the multi-week uptrend remains intact for now, early signs of exhaustion suggest Ethereum Classic may be due for a pullback.","Key levels to watch will be the initial support around $19.23 and resistance at $20.79.","A break above resistance could resume the uptrend, while a drop below the $19.23 support warns of a deeper correction ahead.","Trading within defined risk limits is advised over the near term until ETC\u2019s next move becomes apparent.","","","The IMX price has seen a dramatic surge today, jumping 19.85% amidst news of a major collaboration with video game publisher Ubisoft.","This has propelled the price to attempt to break through multiple resistance levels as bullish momentum accelerates.","The 20-day EMA for the IMX price stands at $0.7763, now well below the 50-day EMA of $0.6784.","With the faster moving average crossing above the slower moving average, this golden cross is a decidedly bullish sign for the IMX price going forward.","Meanwhile, the RSI has skyrocketed to 81.87, up strongly from yesterday\u2019s 73.79 reading.","This shows IMX is heavily overbought right now after the huge single-day gain, but still has room to climb before hitting extremely overbought territory.","The MACD histogram is printing at 0.0298, a sizable increase from the previous day\u2019s 0.0207 value.","This expanding positive momentum points to building bullish sentiment that could continue pushing the IMX price higher in the very near term.","In terms of key price levels, IMX faced resistance between $0.9841 to $1.0210, near the Fib 0.382 level at $0.9836.","After breaking through this zone, it now faces resistance between $1.0606 to $1.0975, close to the Fib 0.236 level at $1.0969.","On support, IMX has backing between $0.8925 to $0.9308, aligning with the Fib 0.5 level at $0.8921. As long as the IMX price holds above this zone, the path of least resistance remains up.","With today\u2019s IMX price surge on big news volume, bulls are clearly in control. However, the big one-day jump also means IMX is overextended on the shorter timeframes.","This signals traders should wait for a pullback or consolidation before looking for additional entries on the long side.","Any retracement that holds the $0.89 support area could offer a buying opportunity.","Otherwise, remaining patient for IMX to establish a new trading range seems prudent.","As seasoned cryptocurrencies capture the spotlight, new presale tokens like Bitcoin ETF and Meme Kombat look to make a name for themselves among investors seeking the next moonshot.","Bitcoin has dominated the
