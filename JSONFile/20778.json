While sales recorded a sharp drop, transaction volumes showed a slight decrease.","In July, transaction volumes were at 10.4 million, a reduced level from 10.8 million in June.

The cost of Ether often sets the tone for the NFT market but while it has plummeted 9% over the past month, several leading NFT projects have plunged above 25%.","While the market wears a bearish outlook with declining figures, some developers are springing ideas of creating new collections at a lower price as consumers turn away from \u201CBlue Chip\u201D NFTs.","In the past 30 days, smaller NFT projects have recorded gains. Miladays has been among the biggest gainers with its floor price skyrocketing by 66% almost moving past the Mutant Ape Yacht Club.Â ","Sproto Gremlins has also shocked many observers with its price hitting 262%.
