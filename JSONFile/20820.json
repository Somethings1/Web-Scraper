Ripps and Cahen had copied Yuga\u2019s NFT art, claiming it was an art project meant to criticize racist elements in Yuga\u2019s works.","Welp, looks like it was a good day for @yugalabs who just won ~$1.5 million in damages in their trademark infringement case PLUS attorneys fees and costs (so another $1 million conservatively and probably much more?). Hopefully their attorneys have some fun at ape fest. pic.twitter.com\/BvP8jrBi0T","\u2014 Birdnals (@BirdnalsLAW) October 26, 2023","","The ruling in question follows an earlier judgment by the United States District Court for the Central District of California, which determined that Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen had indeed infringed on Yuga Labs\u2019 trademarks with their NFT collection in April.","As a result, Yuga Labs was granted an injunction and a subsequent trial that would determine the extent of damages to be awarded to Yuga Labs.","In the trial yesterday, Judge Walter stated that Ripps and Cahen must pay Yuga all the profits they earned from their copied NFTs. He rejected their defense that their copies were satirical and ruled that they intentionally used Yuga\u2019s success to profit.","Federal judge John Walter said,","\u201CDefendants were not creating a parody or satire. Instead, they were intentionally using the BAYC marks in an effort to profit off of Yuga\u2019s success.\u201D","The judge also awarded Yuga attorneys\u2019 fees and $200,000 in damages for cybersquatting. In addition, he ordered Ripps and Cahen to stop selling the copied NFTs and transfer their related digital assets and social media accounts to Yuga Labs.","Yuga accused Ripps and Cahen of making millions of dollars by counterfeiting its Bored Ape tokens, which they defended as a form of art and critique. This case is currently under reconsideration by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based on a California law protecting free speech.","Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen\u2019s attorney, Louis Tompros, expressed their disagreement with certain aspects of the judge\u2019s decision and indicated their intention to appeal the ruling.","Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Yuga Labs welcomed the ruling, stating that it not only deals with scammers but also supports creators in the advancement of web3 experiences on a global scale.","Earlier this month, Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen\u2019s attorney struggled to convince a panel of judges to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Bored Ape Yacht Club against his clients.","The three judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth District appeared skeptical about the arguments presented by Ripps and Cahen\u2019s attorney, where the judges on the panel focused their analysis on the secondary sale of the copycat NFTs, not the additional criticisms from Ripps and Cahen.","The attorney tried to convince them that the case should be dismissed on the grounds of free speech, asserting that the knock-off Bored Ape NFTs were sold and distributed as a form of protest against alleged hidden anti-Semitic imagery in the original collection.","One of the Circuit Judges, Morgan Christen, expressed doubt, saying, \u201CI\u2019m still not seeing it,\u201D and suggested they were looking for a clearer principle to determine whether this legal action is permissible.","The lawsuit started in June 2022, when Yuga Labs accused Ripps and Cahen of making millions of dollars through trademark infringement, false advertising, and cybersquatting, amongst other charges."],"entity":[{"type":"$1.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Circuit Judges","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Yuga Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bored Ape Yacht Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ryder Ripps","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BAYC marks","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$200,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"United States District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ripps","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ripps","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Louis Tompros","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bored Ape\u2019s NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ninth District","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Yuga Labs","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Morgan Christen","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John Walter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Yuga","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cahen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October 26, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Central District of California","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Walter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jeremy Cahen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States Court of Appeals","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["NFT"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
