I personally think that Bitcoin is much better than gold.\u201D","Yet, the reality is that Bitcoin needs a currency to trade against. ","\u201CSo if you are selling your Bitcoin for something else, in my opinion, selling it for gold is better than selling it for dollars.\u201D","Globally, several countries have started seeking an alternative to the US dollar for settling transactions.","Yet, accepting foreign currencies for international trade introduces the risk of inflation exposure.","Gold may be the solution. It is \u201Cthe only currency that can be understood and could be the common denominator,\u201D Tether CTO said.","As physical gold is challenging to move and use in transactions, digital gold is seen as a more practical option.","Stablecoin-issuer, Tether, has created a model for digital gold, called Tether Gold, that Ardoino believes other countries and organizations could replicate for international trade.","\u201CWe believe that this solution can potentially even outgrow USDT.\u201D","Tether targeted the crypto industry first with its digital gold, as this sector is best positioned to grasp its purpose.","Now, the company is also in talks with hedge funds looking to add Tether Gold to their portfolios.","Tether Gold is designed to play a pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ardoino explained. It would reduce the dependency on USD in lending and borrowing.","Thus, he posited, gold trumps fiat currency as a superior DeFi asset.","On top of regulation, Tether Gold\u2019s focus is on security and validating the gold that underpins the digital tokens.","One key security measure is ensuring that the physical gold is stashed in the world\u2019s safest location.","Switzerland, renowned for its trustworthiness and neutrality, is the perfect repository for this gold, being an \u201Cagnostic\u201D nation, Ardoino suggested.","A comprehensive audit is another crucial step. This entails more than just weighing the gold; sophisticated tools must measure other parameters, including density.","With the physical and auditing aspects covered, attention then shifts to regulatory matters.","On the regulatory front, Ardoino confirmed that Tether is collaborating with global regulators to secure licenses and expand.","In this evolving landscape of Fintech and crypto, the fusion of traditional assets like gold with blockchain technology demonstrates an exciting potential. ","As Tether continues to pioneer this new frontier, the world watches, ready to navigate the uncharted territories of digital gold.","____","\u2013 Tether Announces Q1 Profit of $1.48 Billion and Discloses Bitcoin, Gold Reserves\n\u2013 Tether Stablecoin Recoups Lost Market Value in 2022 Crash, Topping $83.2 Billion\n\n\u2013 Tether Plans Bitcoin Mining in Uruguay\n\u2013 Tether Plans 15% of Its Net Profits Into Bitcoin in Move of Confidence\n\n\u2013 What is DeFi?
