The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.","\u2014 Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 9, 2024","","In a statement published on Monday this week, the SEC said that six months before the attack, an additional layer of protection known as multi-factor authentication (MFA) had been removed by staff and was only reinstated after the January 9 attack.","The fraudulent post was followed by a vote by the commission the next day, which ultimately resulted in the approval of all spot Bitcoin ETF applications.","SIM swapping involves attackers gaining control of a phone number by having it reassigned to a new device.","Once in control of the phone number, the unauthorized party reset the password for the @SECGov account, the statement said.","The new statement from the regulator confirms key details shared by X Safety already the day after the incident.","We can confirm that the account @SECGov was compromised and we have completed a preliminary investigation. Based on our investigation, the compromise was not due to any breach of X\u2019s systems, but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number\u2026","\u2014 Safety (@Safety) January 10, 2024","","According to the new SEC statement, law enforcement agencies are currently investigating how the hackers persuaded the SEC\u2019s mobile carrier to facilitate the phone number switch.","The agency did not disclose the identity of the carrier involved.","Both lawmakers and leaders from the crypto industry have sought explanations for the SEC\u2019s vulnerability to such an attack, especially given the regulator\u2019s stringent cybersecurity requirements for publicly traded companies.","The incident is under investigation by various agencies, including the SEC\u2019s Office of Inspector General and its Division of Enforcement, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.","Multi-factor authentication is now enabled for all SEC social media accounts that offer it, the SEC statement added."],"entity":[{"type":"MFA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 10, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday this week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Federal Bureau of Investigation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Infrastructure Security Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 9, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Division of Enforcement","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","ETF","SEC"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
