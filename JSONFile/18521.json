This audit went beyond standard security checks to assess specific privacy and functionality aspects of the Orb.","Read the report from a highly specialized audit of the orb\u2019s software conducted by the security experts at @trailofbits https:\/\/t.co\/jVNuG20GzM","\u2014 Worldcoin (@worldcoin) March 14, 2024","","The audit investigated Worldcoin\u2019s Orb devices, focusing on how they handle and secure user data. The findings indicated that the devices do not store personal information, except for iris codes, which are encrypted and uploaded for verification purposes.","TFH outlined several technical claims to guide the audit, focusing on the Orb\u2019s software as of its July 8, 2023 version.","During the default opt-out signup process, the Orb is designed to collect only the user\u2019s iris code, avoiding any storage or transfer of personally identifiable information (PII) other than this.","The goal is to ensure no PII is written to the Orb\u2019s persistent storage or uploaded from the device, except for the iris code.","For users opting into a more data-inclusive signup flow, any PII saved on the device\u2019s SSD is encrypted asymmetrically, making it inaccessible for decryption by the Orb itself.","The audit also verified that the Orb does not pull sensitive information from a user\u2019s device. The only data collected is encapsulated within a QR code scanned by the Orb.","The handling of a user\u2019s iris code was scrutinized for security. It was confirmed that the iris code is not stored persistently on the Orb, is transmitted in a single request to the backend, and can only be sent to pre-approved servers, secured by end-to-end encryption.","According to Trail of Bits, the analysis \u201Cdid not uncover vulnerabilities in the Orb\u2019s code that can be directly exploited in relation to the Project Goals as described.\u201D","\u201CWhile Trail of Bits\u2019 review identified some unconfirmed concerns that could theoretically affect project goals, and the affected code has since been updated,\u201D the report reads. \u201CThe audit did not identify any instances where the project goals would be directly compromised.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"March 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Trail of Bits","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 8, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Worldcoin Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Sam Altman","Security","Worldcoin"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
