This implies that Bitcoin\u2019s price is not obligated to experience continuous growth over time, and substantial fluctuations in value, such as those observed from 2020 to 2023, can still be explained within the framework of his power law model.","A power law is a mathematical concept describing a relationship where one variable changes proportionally to a constant exponent of another.Â  The power law is a recurring pattern found in various natural phenomena, from the frequency of earthquakes to the dynamics of stock market fluctuations.","Santostasi initially introduced his model on the r\/Bitcoin subreddit in 2018. It gained renewed attention in January when finance YouTuber Andrei Jeikh, who has 2.3 million subscribers, discussed it in a video.","In a subsequent post following up on his conversation with Santostasi on X, Krueger delved into additional mathematical modeling of the power law applied to Bitcoin, predicting that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 within the next two years.","Krueger further stated that if Bitcoin follows the model, its market cap is projected to surpass that of gold by the year 2033, which would see Bitcoin\u2019s value reach $1 million per coin."],"entity":[{"type":"next 15 years of Bitcoin","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2033","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2045","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Santostasi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fred Krueger","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"YouTuber Andrei Jeikh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 2, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jim] Cramer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Giovanni Santostasi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Krueger","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin Price","Bitcoin Price Prediction"],"authors":["Brian Yue"]}
