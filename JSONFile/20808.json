The committee approved key amendments on February 21.","The Russian media outlet RBC reported that the law will come into force on its \u201Cdate of official publication.\u201D This is with \u201Cthe exception of a number of provisions, which will come into force later.\u201D","The law establishes a regulatory framework for \u201Cconducting foreign trade transactions using digital assets as a means of payment.\u201D","The Committee\u2019s Chairman Anatoly Aksakov said that using \u201Cdigital assets\u201D in foreign trade transactions would \u201Chelp Russian importers and exporters work more effectively with friendly countries.\u201D","US, UK, and EU-led sanctions have all but frozen Russian banks out of the international trade picture, and put an effective end to dollar-denominated trade.","But Aksakov claimed that digital asset-powered trade could \u201Cpartially mitigate the impact of sanctions on Russia.\u201D","Aksakov has also stated that several Russian allies are \u201Cvery interested\u201D in using digital assets and CBDCs in trade deals with Moscow.","The law Putin signed on March 11 gives Russia\u2019s Central Bank new regulatory powers over the payments sector.","The bank is already the sole issuer of the digital ruble and the chief regulator of the fast-growing Russian digital financial assets (DFAs) space.","However, the new law will also give the bank the \u201Cauthority to regulate transactions made using digital financial assets.\u201D","DFA issuers must provide the Central Bank with information about the recipients of assets. And firms that use DFAs and CBDCs in payments will be obliged to log all transactions on a newly created information system.","Russian law recognizes a large number of digital assets as DFAs. These include digitized commodities and securities, digital rights, and digitized monetary claims.","Investors will also be able to buy digital shares in unlisted Russian companies under the new law.","Russia is weighing options for big tax increases after next week's election, in order to fund Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine https:\/\/t.co\/a6aPXfFSdw","\u2014 Bloomberg (@business) March 11, 2024","","Before the new law\u2019s launch, Russian law contained no provisions for using DFAs in foreign trade.","Some Russian experts have urged caution, however. They note that the law requires firms to register all DFA-related accounting on Russian systems.","Crypto firm moved $4.2m of assets to digital wallet linked to alleged Russian arms dealer https:\/\/t.co\/5LYEUeEmXp","\u2014 Guardian news (@guardiannews) March 11, 2024","","The law also has no provisions for overseas DFAs. This, analysts say, \u201Cmay be an obstacle for non-Russian residents.\u201D","Unless Putin signs off on a reciprocal law, it remains to be seen if Russian trading partners will prove keen to do DFA and CBDC-related business with Moscow."],"entity":[{"type":"Duma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Committee\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federation Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 11, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"State Duma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4.2m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Anatoly Aksakov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State Duma\u2019s Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moscow","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"RBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Putin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Financial Markets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vladimir Putin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 21","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aksakov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DFAs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DFA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
