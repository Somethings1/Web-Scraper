But it\u2019s got to hurt.\u201D","Both Crypto.com and Coinbase \u201Csplurged\u201D on Super Bowl LVI ads in February this year, with the latter paying some USD 14 million for its one-minute halftime ad.","Last week, crypto exchange Binance\u2019s chief Changpeng \u201CCZ\u201D Zhao appeared keen to show that he had made shrewd decisions on the crypto sponsorship and advertising fronts, with his company still expanding despite the market crunch.","It was not easy saying no to Super bowl ads, stadium naming rights, large sponsor deals a few months ago, but we did.\n\nToday, we are hiring for 2000 open positions for #Binance. pic.twitter.com\/n24nrUik8O","Binance is the main shirt sponsor of the Italian football club Napoli, however. The firm paid around USD 32 million to become the club\u2019s primary sponsor in October 2021.","A potential deal involving a major crypto exchange remains on the table at six-times European champions Liverpool FC, although this looks increasingly unlikely considering the market conditions.","Liverpool\u2019s city rivals, Everton FC, appear to be set to buck this trend, however. The crypto casino operator Stake.com has penned a deal that will see the firm become EFC\u2019s main shirt sponsor in an undisclosed \u201Cclub record\u201D deal, the Liverpool Echo reported.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Ukrainian Crypto Exchange Reportedly Close to FC Barcelona Sleeve Sponsorship Deal\n\u2013 Chelsea Secures First Crypto Shirt Sponsor in USD 24M Deal\n\n\u2013 Crypto Sports Sponsorship Moves into Fast Lane with OKX F1 Deal\n\u2013 Liverpool FC Mull Bid to Ditch TradFi for Crypto Firm in Shirt Sponsorship Deal\n\n\u2013 Binance CEO Eyed Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea\n\u2013 Crypto.com Scores World Cup"],"entity":[{"type":"Liverpool Echo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD 32 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"The Washington Wizards","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Miami","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1990s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Major League Baseball (MLB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"LA Clippers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Napoli","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Everton FC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase \u201C","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NBA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2000","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2013 Ukrainian Crypto Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FC Barcelona Sleeve Sponsorship Deal\n\u2013 Chelsea Secures First Crypto Shirt Sponsor","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Los Angeles","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Washington Wizards","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Columbia University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Joe Favorito","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Columbia University Sports Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chris Lencheski","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"LVI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Liverpool FC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"LA Lakers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD 135 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["advertising","Binance","Coinbase","Crypto.com","Europe","FTX","Marketing","Sport","USA"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
