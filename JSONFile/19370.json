Here\u2019s everything you need to know.","According to official data shared by the asset manager, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds an astronomical 105,280.3 BTC in its portfolio. The bitcoin haul is worth over $5.4 billion in market valuations.","The IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF also includes a minor fiat component totaling $80,698.75.","Zooming in on the number of shares, the ETF currently has over 167.24 million outstanding shares locked in.","Spot Bitcoin ETFs are increasingly the go-to choice for mainstream investors. They address issues like storing crypto assets and dealing with fraudulent service providers.","In addition to BlackRock, other asset managers such as Fidelity, BitWise, VanEck, and Ark 21Shares have also launched their spot Bitcoin ETF funds.","BlackRock\u2019s IBIT has been the most popular, however, as it has surged 3,700% from its opening 2,621 BTC on January 11 to its current 105,280 BTC stash.","IBIT is a new player in the exchange-traded product (ETP) ecosystem. From the onset, Bitcoin-powered investment services were made popular by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).","GBTC has seen its Bitcoin holdings greatly dwindle, however. This is likely because the company charges 1.5% in fees, much higher than Fidelity\u2019s 0.35% or BlackRock\u2019s 0.25%.","According to official data on its website, GBTC now holds 463,475 BTC, down from the 619,220 it held following its launch on January 11.","Given the competitive rates it offers, IBIT has enjoyed the most in digital asset investment inflows in the past month.","According to a blog post by Farside Investors, the ETF inflow as of February 13 stood at $631 million in total.","Out of this sum, the IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF attracted $493.1 million, while Fidelity\u2019s FBTC took in $163.6 million. Bitwise\u2019s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) came in a distant third with $10.8 million.","The new spot #BitcoinÂ ETFs hold more $BTC than @saylor \u2018s $MSTR","The 9 new ETFs purchased 216,309 Bitcoin (worth $10.3 Billion!!!) in just 20 days ðŸ’¥$IBIT $FBTC $ARKB $BITB $BRRR $BTCO $HODL $EZBC pic.twitter.com\/i8amhqCjWF","\u2014 HODL15Capital ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@HODL15Capital) February 11, 2024","","Meanwhile, a recent report by HODL15Capital revealed legacy asset firms have amassed a major chunk of bitcoin.
