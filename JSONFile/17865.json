This is enough to power an average U.S. household for about 60 days.","A single bitcoin transaction consumes more electricity than a US household in a month. A query on ChatGPT uses 10 times more electricity than a Google search. Moving all internet queries to AI will consume as much electricity as Ireland does in a year https:\/\/t.co\/5pq6n1E9cZ","\u2014 Reveal IT Ireland (@RevealITIreland) April 4, 2024","","While Bitcoin has shown resilience and adaptability, the increasing focus on green technologies might influence its price and the broader investor landscape, potentially driving a shift towards more sustainable alternatives.","On the global stage, the response to the crypto energy crisis varies. Countries like Sweden and Iceland have embraced green crypto mining thanks to their abundant renewable energy sources. ","Conversely, China, once a powerhouse in the crypto mining world, is predicted to implement a ban on high-energy blockchains in a decisive move to curb the environmental degradation linked to these activities.","This looming ban could set a precedent, urging other nations to consider similar restrictions or to adopt more sustainable practices in the cryptocurrency mining industry. ","The collective shift towards green crypto could redefine the economic and environmental landscape of digital finance, presenting a new paradigm where technology and sustainability are no longer at odds but are intertwined for global betterment."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sweden","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 4, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Iceland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Microsoft","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Algorand","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Google Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ireland","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","China","Energy"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
