For now, consolidation could take precedence, as observed with the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator, which currently indicates a negative volume flow of -28.73M.","Failure to break and hold above SOL\u2019s immediate resistance at the 50-day EMA and the confluence seller congestion at $21 may delay the breakout eyeing $24 in the short term.","Support would be expected to come in handy at $20 but if push comes to shove and overhead pressure overwhelms the bulls, Solana price may resolve to seek support at $16.00.","Traders considering increasing exposure to Solana on Tuesday should take note of certain factors. ","For example, SOL is currently trading above its weekly open at $20.54, with the previous day\u2019s open at $20.02 serving as a strong support zone.","If liquidity from the $20 support level is robust enough to overcome resistance from the 50-day EMA, 100-day EMA, and 200-day EMA, Solana\u2019s price could potentially challenge the monthly open at $21.21.","It\u2019s important to note that a sustained drop below the previous day\u2019s open at $20.02 might cause Solana\u2019s price to retest the crucial support level at $16.","Nonetheless, investors should also be mindful of short-term support levels at $19 and $18.","For those looking to invest in SOL over a medium to long-term horizon, it is recommended to wait for the SuperTrend indicator (the thick line overlaying the chart) to flip below the price and change its color from red to green before initiating their positions.","Buy Solana Now",""],"entity":[{"type":"Solana Now","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SOL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$20.02","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$16","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Messari","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$19","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$18","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"EMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MACD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Convergence Divergence (MACD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$20","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$20.72","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$21.21","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$21.00","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$24","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$20.54","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$21","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$27","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"James Stautman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"95%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"winter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$20.1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$16.00","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["SOL","Solana"],"authors":["John Isige"]}
