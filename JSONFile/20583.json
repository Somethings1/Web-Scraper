Without stablecoins, overall trading volume and liquidity in the crypto market would likely drop 75%.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"mid-May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"November last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Reflexivity Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"William Quigley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States Financial Accounting Standards Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Fidelity","Stablecoins"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
