Kaplan go as far as to call the FTX founder a \u201Ckind\u201D and \u201Cwonderful person.\u201D","\u201CThe hope that customer funds will be reimbursed in some measure mitigates the severity of Sam\u2019s guilt, and it seems the length of his sentence should reflect this fact,\u201D the parent of an FTX customer who lost their life savings on the doomed crypto exchange wrote.","\u201CThough I have never met Sam, I firmly believe that while he may be an MIT grad \u2013 he did not fully understand the scope of what was going on and did not have malicious intent,\u201D said a mother of a son with ASD.","SBF sentencing this week.","How much time do you think he deserves in jail? I feel kind of bad for him tbh","\u2014 Raffs (@sol_flex69) March 27, 2024","","Sam Bankman-Fried is facing a potential maximum penalty of over 100 years in federal prison following his November 2023 whirlwind trial that saw the FTX founder convicted on seven different fraud charges.","His lawyers have since requested a maximum prison sentence of six years for orchestrating the $8 billion digital asset fraud, citing his ASD and \u201Cgenuine concern\u201D for others.","Shortly after Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal team filed additional letters on the FTX founder\u2019s behalf pushing for leniency on Wednesday, prosecutors submitted their own court filings in the form of additional victim impact statements.","\u201CMy whole life has been destroyed,\u201D one FTX depositor wrote, stating that he \u201Cdid not agree to the risk that Sam Bankman-Fried took\u201D with his funds.","\u201CSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s callous disregard for the impact of his actions on individuals like myself, who have diligently worked to build a future, is reprehensible and deserving of maximum sentencing,\u201D wrote another.","While Bankman-Fried is facing potentially hefty prison time for his role in FTX\u2019s ultimate collapse, the actual length of his sentence will largely be under the discretion of Judge Kaplan and the court\u2019s recommended guidelines.","\u201CKaplan\u2019s tough \u2013 and he has that reputation \u2013 but he\u2019s not nasty,\u201D former U.S. assistant attorney and white-collar crime expert Kevin J. O\u2019Brien said in an interview with Cryptonews. \u201CI don\u2019t think he\u2019s effectively going to put the guy away for the rest of his adult life. He\u2019s going to give him an opportunity to make amends and live a meaningful life outside of prison.\u201D","When asked how long of a prison sentence the FTX founder would get, O\u2019Brien suggested two decades in prison. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sam Bankman-Fried got 15 years,\u201D he concluded.","Cryptonews will be reporting live from the courtroom of Bankman-Fried\u2019s March 28 sentencing starting at 9:30 a.m ET."],"entity":[{"type":"March 27, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MIT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam\u2019s guilt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lewis A.
