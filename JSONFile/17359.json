Over the years there has been a lack of trust in the space and a call for more regulation around exchanges.","\u201CThe lack of regulated trading venues is materially hampering the growth of the digital currency trading market,\u201D said M&G Portfolio Manager, Jeremy Punnett, in a press release.","\u201CThe UK has the potential to become a global hub for digital asset technology and investment, making London an excellent destination for GFO-X\u2019s new global trading venue. This investment enables GFO-X to scale its operations as the business is set to benefit from investors shifting their trading from unregulated to regulated venues,\u201D adds Punnett.","M&G went on to highlight that GFO-X will target traditional financial institutions wanting to trade digital currency derivatives in a safe and regulated venue.","According to M&G A 2022 survey showed there is significant demand from institutional investors for infrastructure.  It is estimated 91% of institutional investors are interested in tokenised products, 41% currently hold cryptocurrencies and a further 15% plan on adding digital assets to their portfolios over the medium term."],"entity":[{"type":"91%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"M&G Plc","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"M&G","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Global Futures & Options Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"41%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Prudential","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"London Clearing House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$20 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Punnett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jeremy Punnett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Financial Conduct Authority (FCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"M&G Portfolio Manager","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Derivatives"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
