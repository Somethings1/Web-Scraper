Kong ETF Issuers Anticipate $300 Million First-Day Inflows: Bloomberg","category":["Altcoin News "],"content":["IssuersÂ are expectingÂ approximately $300 million in combined first-day inflows for the six new Hong Kong spot-crypto ETFs, with a preference forÂ BitcoinÂ funds.","Hong Kong hasÂ launched its first batch of ETFsÂ focused on cryptocurrencies, marking potential competition for the popular Bitcoin products in the United States.Â ","Harvest Global Investments Ltd., the local unit of China Asset Management,Â along withÂ a partnership between HashKey Capital Ltd. and Bosera Asset Management (International) Co., listed Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the city on Tuesday.Â ","In the US, spot Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments were launched in January, accumulating a historic $52 billion in assetsÂ so far.Â ","Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Rebecca Sin estimates that Bitcoin and Ether funds in Hong KongÂ could amass around $1 billionÂ over the next two years.","However,Â Han Tongli,Â the CEO of Harvest Global, believes thatÂ the estimate is too conservative.Â ","He argues thatÂ financial products and services in Hong Kong areÂ accepted by investors bothÂ in the West and the East, whereas the US primarily caters to the former.Â ","As a result, issuers are expecting approximately $300 million in combined first-day inflows for the six new Hong Kong spot-crypto ETFs, with a preference for Bitcoin funds.","OFFICIAL: SPOT #BITCOIN ETFS COMMENCE TRADING IN HONG KONG ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° pic.twitter.com\/yI8HsqRECf","\u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 30, 2024","","Potential sources for these inflows include Chinese wealth parked in the city, as well asÂ active crypto exchanges and market makers in the Asia Pacific region.Â ","While crypto tradingÂ is bannedÂ in mainland China, the new funds fall outside theÂ scope of the programÂ that grants Chinese investors access to some Hong Kong ETFs,Â which raisesÂ the question of whetherÂ the program could be expandedÂ in the future.","The adoption ofÂ an in-kind ETF subscription and redemption mechanism sets Hong Kong apart.Â ","It allows for the underlying assets toÂ be exchangedÂ for fund units and vice versa, unlike the cash redemption model used by US Bitcoin funds.Â ","Han believes this in-kind approach enhances the appeal of Hong Kong\u2019s products and could result in the eventual uptake of the ETFs being three times larger than that of the US funds.","Meanwhile, some caution that expected demand must be adjusted considering Hong Kong\u2019s smaller financial sector.Â ","While the city already permits crypto-futures-based ETFs, their total assets of around $164 million are a fraction of the $2.3 billion held by the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF,Â which isÂ a derivatives-based product in the US.","Despite potential challenges, Hong Kong\u2019s local productsÂ are appealingÂ due to easy access, particularly during Asian trading hours.Â ","Bosera Asset Management (International)\u2019s Head of Products, Ethan Li, expressed confidence in the appeal of the Hong Kong ETFs and mentioned the company\u2019s plans to expand its team and digital-asset product pipeline.Â ","While digital assets have experienced a significant rebound since the market collapse in 2022, the recent revival has stalled.Â ","Bitcoin\u2019s priceÂ sits atÂ around $63,540, approximately $10,000 below its record high in March.Â "],"entity":[{"type":"US Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethan
