According to data from Bitcoin block explorer mempool.space, 3,050 transactions occurred, meaning the average user paid a little under $800.","","One reason for the record fees was an influx as users rushed to engrave and etch unique Satoshis on the halving block. ","The new Runes Protocol, developed by Bitcoin Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor, was the main source of the influx of activity, as it launched simultaneously with the halving.","Runes have been marketed as a more efficient way to create new tokens on the Bitcoin network, compared to the BRC-20 token standard \u2014 an Ordinals-based method for creating Bitcoin-based tokens.","Runes, like BRC-20s, use the Bitcoin network and pay fees in Bitcoin to generate new tokens. However, Runes uses the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model to \u201Cetch\u201D new tokens on Bitcoin. This contrasts with Ordinals\u2019 \u201Cinscription\u201D account model, according to a protocol explainer from Rodarmor. ","The protocol lets users inscribe individual satoshis with unique identification numbers, and embed them with arbitrary data directly into Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.","Aside from the battle to inscribe one of the first Runes, Bitcoin mining pools competed for what is known as an \u201Cepic\u201D satoshi. An epic satoshi is the very first satoshi, or the smallest possible Bitcoin denomination, mined on the halving block.","Given the decrease in Bitcoin mining rewards, many crypto miners have taken a threatening hit to their income, leaving them vulnerable.","So far, Bitcoin miners have been making up for the loss of mining rewards following the halving through technological advancements that have improved mining efficiency.","However, according to pseudonymous Ordinals developer Leonidas, \u201CRunes degens have single-handedly offset the drop in miner rewards from the halving.\u201D","In the last five Bitcoin blocks the fees have surpassed the coinbase reward!","The Runes degens have single handedly offset the drop in miner rewards from the halving.","Runes are drastically increasing Bitcoin's security budget.","You're welcome @LukeDashjr","\u2014 Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) April 20, 2024","","According to aggregated data from mempool. space, a total of $3.82 million in fees, excluding miner subsidies, was spent on the five blocks following the halving, signifying a positive future despite the anticipated massive impact the halving would have on Bitcoin Mining Operations."],"entity":[{"type":"$2.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Leonidas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Casey Rodarmor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12:09 p.m.","content":"TIME"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Leonidas (","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BRC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Operations","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$107.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 20, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3.82 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin halving","Fees"],"authors":["Harvey Hunter"]}
