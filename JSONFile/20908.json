The increase was in line with what the central bank has long communicated to the market that it would do.¬†","\u201C[\u2026] the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1\/4 to 1\/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting,\u201D the Fed\u2019s announcement said.","The price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped immediately following the announcement, trading down by 1.3% to USD 39,900 in the first five minutes after the release of the Fed\u2019s statement. At the same time, the US S&P 500 stock index dropped 0.5%.","The Fed\u2019s announcement also said that the implications of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are \u201Chighly uncertain\u201D for the US economy, but noted that it is \u201Clikely to create additional upward pressure on inflation.\u201D","The Fed further signaled that it expects to raise rates six more times this year, and three more rate increases in 2023.","The decision today comes after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress earlier in March that the central bank would \u201Cproceed carefully\u201D with its plan to hike interest rates this year despite the war in Ukraine.","US Federal Fund Rate 25-year chart:","Before the war broke out, some economists expressed uncertainty as to whether the Fed would raise rates by 50 basis points at today\u2019s meeting instead of 25, given the high level of inflation. With the war happening, however, a 50 basis point hike now appears unlikely, analysts say.","\u201CIf not for the geopolitical events, 50 basis points would certainly be on the table at this meeting,\u201D Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201CThe one thing Powell can do is to hold out the prospect of 50 down the road,\u201D he added.","Meanwhile, despite the Fed\u2019s decision being widely expected by the market, Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said that volatility should still be expected.","He added that the announcement will provide more clarity as to whether the Fed \u201Cstill plans on carrying out a slow and steady rate hike,\u201D which he said, \u201Cwill not shock the market.\u201D","Similarly, Pankaj Balani, CEO of the crypto derivatives exchange Delta Exchange, also warned of increased volatility.","\u201CWe have seen interest to own the short term and medium-term volatility on BTC at the current levels and expect it to trade violently around the Fed meeting later today,\u201D Balani said in an emailed comment.","Also, CEO of crypto consultancy Eight and popular trader Micha√´l van de Poppe said on Twitter that the first move will probably be \u201Ca fake-out move.\u201D","The fake-out will be followed by \u201Cthe real move, and then actually end up in a panic move overall,\u201D van de Poppe predicted.","Commenting on bitcoin\u2019s prospects as the Fed starts its tightening cycle, the crypto investor Mike Novogratz, who is the founder & CEO of Galaxy Digital, told Bloomberg TV that last year\u2019s bitcoin rally ended largely because the Fed became more \u201Chawkish.\u201D","\u201CI don\u2019t think Bitcoin can rally aggressively until we get a pause,\u201D Novogratz said, referring to the Fed\u2019s rate hikes and emphasizing that \u201Cbitcoin is a narrative story.\u201D","However, he also stressed that he is still a long-term bitcoin bull.","\u201CFive years out, if bitcoin\u2019s not at [USD] 500,000, I\u2019m wrong on the adoption cycle,\u201D Novogratz said.","The legend @novogratz gets it üëäüèº pic.twitter.com\/qu0Lu4gOWI","_____\nLearn more:¬†\n\u2013 Russia Sanctions Means Countries May Transition to Bitcoin Reserves \u2013 Pantera\u2019s CEO\n\u2013 Ukraine War Raises Questions About the \u2018End of Monetary Regime\u2019 and Role of Bitcoin\n\n\u2013 Could the Ukraine Invasion Spark a Global Financial Crisis?\n\u2013 Bitcoin, the Ukraine Crisis and the Central Bankers Dilemma",""],"entity":[{"type":"1\/2 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Poppe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Pankaj Balani","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Marcus Sotiriou","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u2013 Russia Sanctions Means Countries May Transition","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Citi","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Balani","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Delta Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nathan Sheets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bankers Dilemma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jerome Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Federal Reserve (Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Economics","Ethereum","Federal Reserve","Stocks","USA"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
