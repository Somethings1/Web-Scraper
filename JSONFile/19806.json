The SEC alleged in November that the exchange\u2019s parent companies were operating Kraken\u2019s crypto trading platform as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.","The SEC has filed a similar lawsuit against Coinbase.","In a blog post, Kraken said: \u201CToday, we filed a motion asking the Court to dismiss the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Kraken. The SEC\u2019s Complaint did not claim any fraud or consumer harm whatsoever. It made only a registration-based argument that Kraken operates as an unlicensed securities exchange, broker, dealer and clearing agency because crypto tokens are so-called \u201Cinvestment contracts.\u201D  Even taking all of the SEC\u2019s allegations in the Complaint as true \u2013 and many are not \u2013 its argument is flawed as a matter of law.\u201D","By allowing this case to continue sets a \u201Cdangerous precedent for agency overreach,\u201D said Kraken in a blog post. The exchange stresses that the SEC never points to any \u201Ccontract\u201D between buyers on Kraken and token issuers, so there can\u2019t be an \u201Cinvestment contract.\u201D","Kraken adds that with no precedent to defend its self-serving attempt at expanding its jurisdiction, the SEC instead relies on ambiguity and contradiction.","","Kraken denies the claims made by the SEC, stating it would \u201Cvigorously\u201D defend its position. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, \u201Csince at least September 2018, Kraken has made hundreds of millions of dollars unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities.\u201D","The commission seeks injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, interest, and penalties. However, it also included that it had settled with Kraken for $30 million in February. The SEC added that the exchange agreed to stop offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services or staking programs.","In November, Jesse Powell, co-founder of crypto exchange Kraken, called the US regulators masochists attacking America and extortionists chasing crypto companies out of the country. Powell came after the country\u2019s regulators, specifically the SEC.","The crypto exchange has argued that the SEC has made it difficult for crypto companies to register and comply with the unclear rules. Furthermore, it argued that the regulator \u201Chas repeatedly challenged crypto exchanges to come in and register,\u201D but it doesn\u2019t have \u201Ca single law\u201D supporting its position."],"entity":[{"type":"Today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$30 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jesse Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"September 2018","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Kraken","Lawsuit","Securities Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
