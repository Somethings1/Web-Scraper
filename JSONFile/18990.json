Known entities like exchanges and miners hold around 3M BTC, including 1.5M BTC by US entities,\u201D he continued.","\u201CAt this rate, we\u2019ll see a sell-side liquidity crisis within 6 months.\u201D","This scenario would create a scarcity of Bitcoin available for sale. ","#Bitcoin is currently in the price discovery phase.","Once a sell-side liquidity crisis happens, its next cyclical top may exceed our expectations due to limited sell-side liquidity and thin orderbook.","This could occur once accumulation addresses reach around a total of 3M BTC. pic.twitter.com\/HgwGbHR8fL","\u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 12, 2024","","The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is also bucking the trend, experiencing daily outflows of around $500 million. ","Despite these outflows, the value of GBTC\u2019s BTC holdings has remained relatively stable due to Bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation since the ETF launch in January.","When the tipping point of ETF demand is reached, Ki predicts that the impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price may exceed market expectations. ","A sell-side liquidity crisis would limit the availability of sellers and result in a thinner order book, potentially leading to a higher cyclical top for the cryptocurrency.","Ki also highlighted the ongoing uptrend in BTC held by \u201Caccumulation addresses,\u201D which are wallets that receive only inbound transactions. ","However, these holdings would need to double before the crisis sets in, as Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge to new all-time highs has caused accumulation address holdings to cool off.","Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed the decision to approve options trading on spot Bitcoin ETFs.","The agency extended the response deadline for the Cboe Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange, both of which filed bids to offer options on Bitcoin ETFs. ","Analysts, such as VettaFi\u2019s Dave Nadig, predict that the introduction of BTC ETF options will attract hedge fund players who were not previously involved in the crypto ecosystem, providing them with an opportunity to participate in the market.","Multiple leveraged Bitcoin ETFs are also under consideration by the SEC, including filings from asset manager Direxion for five inverse and long spot BTC ETFs, ProShares\u2019 five leveraged Bitcoin funds, and REX Shares\u2019 six leveraged ETFs."],"entity":[{"type":"Ki Young Ju","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ki Young Ju (","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 12, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$500 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"3M BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dave Nadig","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cboe Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Miami International Securities Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Direxion","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$30 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","spot ETF"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
