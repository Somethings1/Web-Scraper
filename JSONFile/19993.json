He also noted that understanding biases is essential for understanding market dynamics.","\u201CSimplistic but unit bias psychology matters a lot. I think about this a lot,\u201D the well-known advisor wrote.","Earlier this month, VanEck\u2019s Gurbacs made headlines when he said that he believes people have overstated the initial impact of a spot Bitcoin ETF.","According to him, only around $100 million should be expected to flow into the ETFs from mostly recycled funds after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves an ETF.","Still, he added that the long-term impact remains very bullish, and that people indeed tend to underestimate this.","\u201CLong term, people tend to underestimate the impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs. If history is any guide, gold is worth studying as a parallel,\u201D he said, while sharing a chart of the gold price before and after the first spot gold ETF.","In my view, people tend to overestimate the initial impact of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs.
