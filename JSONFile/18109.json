Alice claimed that Bitfinex had fallen victim to a large-scale data breach, echoing the assertions of hacking group FSociety on April 26.","The tweet, since deleted, gained traction¬†after¬†being picked up by Walter Bloomberg, a prominent breaking news account with a substantial following. Walter Bloomberg tweeted, citing Shinoji Research, that Bitfinex\u2019s data, comprising 2.5 Terabytes of information and personal details of 400,000 users, had been hacked.","Alice of Shinoji Research later¬†corrected the record, acknowledging their premature assertion.","Removed the original BFX hack post as I'm not able to edit it. What appears to have happened is this \"Flocker\" group curated a list of BitFinex logins from other breaches.","They then made the site look like a ransom demand for a major breach.","\u2014 Alice (e\/nya)üêà\u200D‚¨õ (@Alice_comfy) May 4, 2024","","\u201CRemoved the original BFX [Bitfinex] hack post as I\u2019m not able to edit it,\u201D Alice¬†stated.","\u201CWhat appears to have happened is that this \u2018Flocker\u2019 group curated a list of Bitfinex logins from other breaches. They then made the site look like a ransom demand for a major breach.\u201D","Ardoino clarified that Bitfinex does not store plaintext passwords or 2FA secrets in clear text, further diminishing the credibility of the alleged breach. Out of the purported 22,500 records of emails and passwords leaked by Fsociety, only 5,000 matched with Bitfinex users.","Everyone panicking for a potential database breach on bitfinex.\nTldr: seems fake.","The alleged hackers have posted 2 mega links with sample data contains 22.5k records of email and passwords.\n\u2013 we don't store plaintext passwords, nor 2FA secrets in clear text.\n\u2013 only 5k of 22.5k\u2026","\u2014 Paolo Ardoino üçê (@paoloardoino) May 4, 2024","","Ardoino suggested that the hackers likely gathered data from various other crypto-related data breaches, exploiting the common practice of users utilizing the same login credentials across multiple platforms. Ardoino further stated,","\u201CAs I said on Saturday, Bitfinex\u2019s user database was not breached. We spent the weekend reviewing all internal data to avoid leaving any stone unturned. We concluded that the claim was fake, as suspected from the beginning.\u201D","Fsociety, inspired by the fictional hacking group from the television series \u201CMr. Robot,\u201D asserted on its dark web homepage on April 26 that it had successfully breached several entities, including Bitfinex, Rutgers University, consulting firm SBC Global, and a misspelled reference to Coinmama.","Despite Fsoceity\u2019s claims, none of the alleged victims, including Bitfinex, have acknowledged experiencing a significant data breach or engaging in ransom payment. Ardoino highlighted that Bitfinex never received direct communication from the hacking group and questioned the legitimacy of Fsociety\u2019s assertions.","Here a message from a security researcher (that instead of panicking, trying to dig a bit more into it).","\"I believe I start to understand what is happening and why they are sending these messages claiming you were hacked.\nThe message in the screenshot in the ticket came from a\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/YjwG2eeXw2","\u2014 Paolo Ardoino üçê (@paoloardoino) May 4, 2024","","Moreover, Ardoino shared insights from a security researcher suggesting that Fsociety\u2019s motive may have fabricated the claim of breaching Bitfinex to promote its ransomware tools\u2014the tool to which it purportedly sells access for a subscription fee and a commission on stolen profits.¬†","According to the researcher, such claims generate buzz and serve as advertisements for the tool\u2019s effectiveness, enticing others to purchase it for potential exploitation. Ardoino questioned the rationale behind such actions, wondering if FSOCIETY had successfully breached Bitfinex.","Despite the allegations, Ardoino assured users that Bitfinex would diligently investigate the situation. As of now, no breach has been detected, and all user funds remain secure.","Bitfinex\u2019s history includes a notable hacking incident in 2016, during which over 95,000 Bitcoins were compromised. Two individuals, including the self-professed crypto rapper Razzlekhan, pleaded guilty to money laundering charges related to the hack and forfeited the stolen bitcoin to authorities."],"entity":[{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alice (","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Rutgers University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinmama","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Walter Bloomberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shinoji Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 4, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Flocker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SBC Global","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alice of Shinoji Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BFX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CTO Paolo Ardoino","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitfinex","Data Breach"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
