Of course not,\u201D Hougan added. \u201CThe ones with the best marketing will succeed, but half will be gone within two years.\u201D"," "],"entity":[{"type":"$35,198","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Todd Sohn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Massachusetts","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dave Mazza","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Head of Digital Assets Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$46.5 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Strategas Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$55 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2006","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Matthew Hougan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitwise Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lexington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Valkyrie Funds","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Matthew Sigel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coromandel Wealth Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steven McClurg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Roundhill Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"George Gagliardi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$30 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
