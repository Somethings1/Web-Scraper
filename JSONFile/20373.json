The bank has also demonstrated pessimism with regard to the lack of transparency inherent to the CAR\u2019s economy. ","At the same time, it continues to provide financial support to the nation, and last May, it approved a project worth USD 35m to implement digital governance in the country\u2019s public sector.  ","Meanwhile, on YouTube, in the comment section under the Sango event video, some commentators were skeptical despite the event\u2019s optimistic tone. User Dave Mcllroy, for example, wrote that the CAR was \u201C[g]oing to learn the hard way unfortunately. Centralized sh*tcoin, will be bankrupt within 18mo. Had CAR simply invested in Bitcoin and held on, they\u2019d have changed their country\u2019s fortunes while ushering in the new economies of the EMs\u201D.","Speaking of which, the Central African Republic made headlines earlier this year after it was reported that it had adopted bitcoin (BTC)\u201D as its \u201Clegal tender\u201D. ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Central African Republic Has Adopted Bitcoin as Legal Tender \u2013 Reports\n\u2013 Central African Republic Moves Ahead With Its Crypto Hub Initiative Despite World Bank\u2019s Concerns\n\n\u2013 Africa Gets A Chance To Ride El Salvador-Triggered Bitcoin Hype Wave\n\u2013 New York State to Ban Carbon-Powered Bitcoin, Altcoin Mining, While Kenya Fosters Green BTC\n\n\u2013 Zimbabwe Eyes Crypto\n\u2013 Cardano\/IOHK Plans to Launch the Ethiopia Student Blockchain Project in \u2018Next Two Months\u2019"],"entity":[{"type":"Ethiopia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Archange Touadéra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Touadéra","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the World Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EMs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sango","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Hub Initiative Despite World Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York State","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Faustin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sango Coin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Altcoin Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"57%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Dave Mcllroy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"While Kenya Fosters Green BTC\n\n\u2013 Zimbabwe Eyes Crypto\n\u2013 Cardano\/IOHK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Africa","Altcoins"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
