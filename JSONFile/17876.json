The platform also reveals that the Salvadoran government acquired an additional 31 BTC in the past month and 7 BTC in the previous week.","The recent addition to its BTC reserves aligns with President Nayib Bukele\u2019s visionary strategy, announced in November 2022, in which El Salvador aims to accumulate \u201C1 bitcoin per day.\u201D By actively increasing its Bitcoin reserves, El Salvador continues to position itself as a leader in Bitcoin and blockchain technology.","With the launch of this new website, El Salvador continues to lead the way in embracing Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Some proponents speculate that these strategic initiatives could position El Salvador as one of the wealthiest and most innovative nations globally within the next few decades, fueled by Bitcoin adoption.","El Salvador made headlines in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. The move aimed to foster financial inclusion, streamline remittance payments, and promote financial innovation.","President Nayib Bukele\u2019s decision faced criticism, particularly after Bitcoin\u2019s price plunged from its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. Despite volatility, El Salvador has remained steadfast in its Bitcoin strategy, dollar-cost-averaging into the cryptocurrency since 2021, with an average buying price of $43,097 per BTC.","With Bitcoin currently trading above $62,000, El Salvador\u2019s holdings have yielded an unrealized profit exceeding $57.4 million, per the Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker website.","In a recent commentary, Bukele, who secured reelection in February, has aimed at mainstream media narratives surrounding the government\u2019s economic policies. He criticized the media\u2019s focus on El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, highlighting the contrast in coverage between periods of low and high Bitcoin market prices.","Bukele emphasized the significant increase in Bitcoin\u2019s market value, suggesting that if El Salvador were to sell its holdings now, it would realize a profit of over 40%. He reiterated the government\u2019s stance of holding onto Bitcoin, emphasizing that \u201C1 BTC = 1 BTC\u201D regardless of market fluctuations. Bukele pointed out the silence of media critics who previously highlighted potential losses during lower Bitcoin prices.","Despite the attention garnered by El Salvador\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin, it stands as a singular example among nation-states in adopting a \u201CBitcoin standard.\u201D While rumors circulate about other countries potentially following suit, no official announcements have been made.","However, there are speculations that if Bitcoin reaches $100,000, El Salvador could pay off its loans to the International Monetary Fund, paving the way for financial independence."],"entity":[{"type":"The Bitcoin Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$43,097","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"September 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bukele","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 12, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nayib Bukele","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker website","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador\u2019s BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$57.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$352.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$69,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"International Monetary Fund","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$62,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Treasury","El Salvador","Nayib Bukele"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
