RON Price Plummets as New ICO Makes Cloud Mining More Accessible","category":["Industry Talk "],"content":["After its listing on Binance, the GameFi-focused Layer-1 solution Ronin Coin witnessed a -26% drop in RON price.","This RON price analysis will look to see if Ronin Coin is about to crash even further.","Indeed, the dramatic downturn comes following Ronin Coin\u2019s long-awaited Binance listing, which saw RON price rally into the news and dump seismically upon the event in a classic \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 event.","感谢今天所有关心币安，热爱币安，支持币安的朋友们，也收到了很多建议，我都有认真一条条看。过去偶尔有关于币安上币信息泄漏的激烈讨论，通常是一些尚未发布代币的项目，社区为了保持热度过度宣传并不鲜见；但今天RONIN上币公告发布后RONIN价格下跌引发了社区激烈讨论，经过内部调查发现是之前集成公\u2026","\u2014 Yi He (@heyibinance) February 5, 2024","","Now Binance has announced new measures will be brought in to prevent a similar \u2018dump\u2019 occurrence on future listings, with measures aimed specifically at reducing the risk of team corruption \u2013 in a hint at the cause of the sell-off move.","As RON price pushes through retracement, Ronin coin is currently trading at a market price of $2.67 (representing a 24-hour change of -1.66%).","This comes in a tough rejection from upper trendline resistance, which has seen RON price plummet -2.66% down from a local high at $3.60.","Now finding feet above lower support from the 20DMA, which is currently stood at $2.55, RON price appears to be holding strong technical poise.","","Indeed, the 20DMA has provided support to much of Ronin Coin\u2019s recent upside price movements, with steadfast footing visible in the chart since October 2023.","RON price analysis reveals a strong likelihood of a bounce at these levels, and this is a view which receives confirmation from RON\u2019s key indicators.","Namely, the RSI indicator has cooled-off significantly in the retracement move, now showing only moderate bearish divergence at 55 \u2013 in a suggestion that the worst of retracement is over for now.","This meets with a degree of confirmation from the MACD indicator, which despite the retracement move continues to show bullish momentum underpinning price at 0.005.","Overall, RON price analysis reveals a snapshot of a successful retracement from upper trendline resistance, with RON price left poised above historic support and indicators in potentially bullish positioning.","","To the upside, RON price is left targeting an upside move to upper resistance around $3.09 (a potential +15.8%).","While downside risk could see RON price tumble down to lower support at $2.02 (a possible -24.29%).","Therefore, RON price analysis reveals that Ronin coin currently has a risk: reward ratio of 0.64 on the short-time frame \u2013 a bad entry \u2013 dominated by downside risk.","But while Ronin coin offers a poor entry on the short-time frame, a better opportunity is emerging ahead of the Bitcoin halving event, in the form of the Bitcoin Minetrix presale.","","Dive into the innovative world of Bitcoin Minetrix and its pioneering stake-to-mine system \u2013 as the skyrocketing presale smashes +$10,342,452 raised \u2013 with the latest Stage 24 just kicking off!","Offering an enticing 75% Staking APY, Bitcoin Minetrix provides a platform where users can buy, stake, and then watch as the rewards start accumulating.","The true essence of passive income in the crypto world has never been this accessible.","Stage 24 of #BitcoinMinetrix is now underway! 🚀","How does the #Bitcoin block size limit affect mining dynamics?
