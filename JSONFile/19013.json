Although the potential behind blockchain technology is huge, a number of setbacks may hamper adoption however.","For instance, the \u201Cblockchain trilemma\u201D continues to be one of the biggest challenges for Web3 developers and users alike.¬†","The blockchain trilemma refers to the notion that it may be impossible to achieve everything blockchain promises \u2013 which is decentralization, security, and scalability. This is because increasing one of these elements often leads to the weakening of another.¬†","Blockchain trillema.","Let's educate ourselves on it to understand how it works in order to protect ourselves from any manipulation.","The blockchain trilemma is a concept coined by Vitalik Buterin that proposes a set of three main issues,decentralization, security and scalability pic.twitter.com\/6v8Vd8XrfQ","\u2014 The Crypto YoGi (üé≠,üè†) (@Yogi13031997) August 20, 2023","","While the blockchain trilemma has existed for years, new solutions are being implemented to address these challenges.¬†","For example, parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) are a recent development that seeks to fix scalability issues plaguing the Ethereum network.¬†","Tom McClean, Senior Researcher at decentralized exchange Vega Protocol, told Cryptonews that a traditional EVM network \u2013 such as Ethereum and many of its layer-2 networks (L2s) \u2013 requires all transactions to be processed sequentially.¬†","But McClean noted that processing transactions one after the other reduces hardware requirements, limits transaction throughput, and doesn\u2019t take advantage of modern advances in multi-core processing.¬†","\u201CParallelized EVMs attempt to reduce this problem by running transactions in parallel, which can theoretically significantly increase processing speed,\u201D said McClean. \u201CThis can lead to a generally faster blockchain.\u201D¬†","Given this potential, Matt Ballensweig, Head of Go Network \u2013 a digital asset settlement solution from BitGo \u2013 told Cryptonews that parallelized EVMs have the ability to solve the blockchain trilemma.¬†","\u201CParallelized EVMs radically reduce transaction latency, allow for much lower transaction fees and create space for interoperability,\u201D he said.","Ballensweig noted that platforms like Neon, Sei Network, and Monad are all working on parallelized EVM solutions to make networks like Solana and Ethereum interoperable and more performant.¬†","Sukanya Parashar, Senior Integration Engineer at Neon, told Cryptonews that Neon EVM is the first EVM live on Solana mainnet.¬†","According to Parashar, Neon\u2019s parallelized EVM solution enables concurrent transaction processing without compromising the security and decentralization of the network \u2013 essentially solving the blockchain trilemma.¬†","Parashar explained that this is made possible by utilizing a state sharding mechanism, which splits blockchain data into partitions.¬†","\u201CThis solution aims to solve the scalability bottleneck, allowing for a higher transaction throughput while maintaining a decentralized consensus,\u201D said Parashar.¬†","She added that the goal behind Neon EVM is to allow Ethereum-based dApps to be deployed on Solana without any code changes. This would also enable developers and users to leverage scalability and parallel processing from the Solana network.¬†","\u201CMultiple dApps spanning across decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming have already launched on Neon EVM,\u201D said Parashar. \u201CAmong these dApps, some are native to Neon EVM while others are pre-existing dApps from the EVM ecosystem that have expanded to Neon EVM to leverage Solana\u2019s liquidity and its network benefits.\u201D","This is important, as Parashar shared that a large portion of Solana\u2019s user base, liquidity, and community remains untapped by EVM-based dApps.¬†","Parashar hopes that Neon\u2019s parallelized EVM solution can solve this, as she pointed out that Solana is the largest non-EVM ecosystem.¬†","\u201CIt\u2019s the fourth largest chain by Total Value Locked, with over 20 million monthly active users and a well matured DeFi ecosystem,\u201D she said. \u201CIn essence, we believe that Neon EVM is the easiest way to access Solana for EVM dApps.\u201D","Startup Sei Labs has also recently introduced a parallelized EVM called \u201CSei V2.\u201D A blog post describing the solution notes, \u201CSei V2 is Sei\u2019s first major upgrade to become the first fully parallelized EVM.\u201D","Head of Marketing at Sei Labs \u2013 who goes by the name of \u201CGrover \u201D \u2013 told Cryptonews that Sei V2 already contains a number of unique features.¬†","\u201CThe first is \u2018Twin Turbo Consensus,\u2019 which allows Sei to reach the fastest time to finality of any blockchain, unlocking web2 like experiences for applications,\u201D he said.¬†","90% of Ethereum transaction time is spent on consensus.

In other words, the feature will introduce major time savings.¬†¬†","\u201CThis ensures total backwards compatibility with Ethereum,\u201D Hon remarked. \u201CPerformant parallel execution requires addressing the biggest bottleneck for execution, which is state access.\u201D","Hon shared that these optimizations for the Ethereum community will be made available later this year.¬†","While the promise of parallelized EVMs is notable, a number of risks are involved with these solutions.","\u201CThough parallelized EVMs have a lot of upside and are quickly evolving and integrating into the broader ecosystem, there are certain risks that need to be carefully mitigated such as increased technical complexity and potential security factors,\u201D said Ballensweig.","Parashar explained that challenges in parallel processing stem from the inherent complexity of implementation in computing systems.¬†","\u201CMultitasking and multiprocessor setups introduce more points of failure,\u201D she said. \u201CIn blockchain networks, like Solana, parallel transaction execution increases system complexity, leading to potential bugs and outages.\u201D","Given this, Parashar commented that ensuring accurate state updates across multiple threads is crucial to prevent invalid changes.¬†","She added that general issues related to parallel and concurrent computing exacerbate complexity, especially in blockchain networks that contain cryptographic elements.","Grover pointed out that the biggest challenge for Sei will be to upgrade the Sei blockchain network with the upcoming parallelized EVM features.¬†","\u201CThis will be like changing the wings on a plane in-flight, but Sei Labs is up to the task,\u201D he said.¬†","Yet Alejo Pinto, Co-Founder and Chief Growth Officer at EVM-product development studio Pontem, expressed skepticism.","\u201CParallelized EVM is an iterative improvement, but relatively untested,\u201D said Pinto. \u201CIt enables all code built with EVM to be ported over.\u201D","Therefore, Pinto believes that alternative virtual machines, like parallelized EVMs, still need to be tested in production before developers and users will feel comfortable adopting them.¬†"],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Vega Protocol","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grover \u201D \u2013","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 21, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tom McClean","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Pinto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Senior Integration Engineer","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Neon EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sukanya Parashar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"McClean","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Grover","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monad","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monad","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Matt Ballensweig","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Parashar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Keone Hon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2030","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August 20, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Parashar","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Neon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machines","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monad","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$469.49 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Alejo Pinto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Total Value Locked","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ballensweig","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["etherem","Parallelized EVM","Solana"],"authors":["Rachel Wolfson"]}
