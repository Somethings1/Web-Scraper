According to him, advisors have steered clients away from these assets over time simply to profit on commissions, even though gold \u201Chas beaten the S&P for decades.\u201D","\u201CThe S&P is about to crash by 70%. Don\u2019t be a loser. Choose your financial advisors carefully,\u201D Robert Kiyosaki wrote on X. \u201CPrepare for the biggest crash in history.\u201D","The prediction, while jaw-dropping for first-time readers, is hardly new. Kiyosaki has publicly called for incoming financial catastrophe at least a dozen times dating back to 2011 and has rarely been correct so far.","Two months ago, the author told followers to withdraw their money from banks in anticipation of the \u201Cbiggest crash in history.\u201D","Just 70% this time? pic.twitter.com\/7nIdtTTy9w","\u2014 Nick Maggiulli (@dollarsanddata) February 12, 2024","","His analysis of gold against stocks is also inaccurate. Dating back to 1974, the S&P 500 has appreciated 5200% while gold has only risen 1306%, according to Longtermtrends. With the exception of the early 80s, gold has rarely outperformed stocks across any time frame.","Regardless, gold has still kept its value far better than USD, which the author regularly criticizes for being easily printed and prone to inflation\/debasement.","Bitcoin proponents, including Kiyosaki, often praise the digital currency as a form of \u201Cdigital gold.\u201D Not only is its maximum supply capped at 21 million coins, but its digital nature makes it easily tradeable in a manner comparable to dollars.","Back in November, Kiyosaki claimed that Bitcoin was the \u201Cbest protection\u201D against hyperinflation\u2014better than both gold and silver.","\u201CBitcoin is people\u2019s money which means people control the value of Bitcoin, not our leaders,\u201D he said.","Since the launch of several spot Bitcoin ETFs last month, Bitcoin has already become the second-largest ETF commodity in the country, inserting itself between silver and gold.","In terms of net inflows, ETFs for the so-called \u201Cdigital gold\u201D have absorbed $3 billion in BTC since last month. By comparison, the very first gold ETF \u2013 GLD \u2013only reached this level after roughly 2 years."],"entity":[{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kiyosaki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2011","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Robert Kiyosaki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"5200%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"February 12, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1974","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1306%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Longtermtrends","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nick Maggiulli","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
