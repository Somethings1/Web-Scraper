While the bill is largely thought to increase the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s oversight of crypto, the Securities and Exchange Commission would likely continue to play a significant role in regulating the industry.","While many have said the bill is something of a turning point for crypto in the U.S., not everyone thinks it will pan out as expected.","\u201CIt does not even shift agencies; SEC would still have huge power. It provides for a dual regulatory regime, split between SEC and CFTC. It does this by giving the CFTC authority it never had--regulatory authority over a spot commodities market,\u201D crypto legal expert Gabriel Shapiro said on X. \u201CMan we have been psyopped so bad on this FIT21 thing.\u201D","\u201CThere has never before been a spot commodities market that is *regulated*...we are just handing this authority over wholesale to the CFTC and hoping they are not insane fascists like Gary (but he used to be head of CFTC lol),\u201D he added.","In other words, the bill is essentially a way for the government to sanction activities that the industry has already been doing without permission, and potentially sets up an agency to interfere with what are supposedly free and open markets.","It was a point echoed by Stephen Palley, another leading legal voice in crypto, who said he does \u201Cnot like [it] at all.\u201D","\u201CIt needlessly creates more jurisdiction for CFTC over spot and a walled garden for incumbents, among other things. But you dipshits kept asking for new laws,\u201D Palley, a partner at Brown Rudnick, added.","Somewhat ironically, Shapiro and Palley\u2019s criticisms seem to line up with Maxine Waters (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, who said it was the one of the worst bills she's ever seen. In addition to potentially stretching the resources of the CFTC, which only has around 700 employees compared to the SEC\u2019s 4,500, it may also undermine other legislative efforts \u2013 like the stablecoin bill Waters worked on alongside House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC).","See also: CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action","\"Let me let you [in] on a secret that the big crypto doesn't want you to know even under this bill,\" Waters said. \"The CFTC does not get enough authority to regulate crypto in this bill.\"","Likewise, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said the effort would create more confusion and regulatory gaps than it closes. Gensler has said for years that the law is clear, and that there should not be bespoke rules for crypto.","Regardless, many in the crypto industry have seen the bipartisan vote as a symbolic vote for crypto itself, perhaps a harbinger of a better future. The move comes just days after the House and Senate voted to repeal a controversial SEC accounting rule, which itself was seen as a sign that sanity will ultimately prevail.","If there is a silver lining, many experts think FIT21 is likely to die on the vine. TD Cowen, for instance, said a few weeks ago the bill stood \"no chance of becoming law in this Congress.\u201D So maybe this is one psyop worth celebrating?"],"entity":[{"type":"\" Waters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gabriel Shapiro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shapiro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk, Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gary (","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stephen Palley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Maxine Waters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brown Rudnick","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Palley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cowen","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201D Palley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","The Node","Newsletters","Fit21","Regulation","Congress"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
