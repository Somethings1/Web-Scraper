In recent years, Upbit has eclipsed Bithumb to become the South Korean market leader.","The exchange also wants to surpass Upbit by becoming the first South Korean crypto exchange to go public on the KOSPI stock market index.","Bithumb told its customers it was doing away with commission fees on October 4 last year. This has led to a rise in trading volumes on Bithumb, with Upbit losing its once-total domination of the market.","Bithumb and Upbit rivals Coinone and Korbit also did away with commission fees, with Upbit refusing to follow suit. The media outlet wrote:","\u201CCommission-free trading has been the main driving force behind Bithumb\u2019s growth over the past four months. Bithumb\u2019s market share, which was only 10% in September last year, grew rapidly, reaching 51% at the end of December.\u201D","However, some have criticized Bithumb\u2019s policy, stating that the exchange needs to focus on its financial performance.","The trading platform saw net profits drop by 46% year-on-year in the third quarter. The media outlet said the industry\u2019s \u201Cconsensus\u201D was that \u201Cpressure to improve performance was the reason Bithumb ended commission-free trading.\u201D","Critics have pointed out that fees are \u201Cthe main source of revenue\u201D for the South Korean crypto exchange industry. However, Bithumb official denied this, saying:","\u201CThe reason we launched [commission fee-free trading] was to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our founding, while also securing more market share.\u201D","The spokesperson said that in the industry, \u201Cfees are directly related to income.\u201D And that meant that Bithumb \u201Ccannot keep offering fee-free trading forever.\u201D The official concluded:","\u201CWe are making efforts to dispel concerns caused by the abolition of our commission-free trading policy. We want to retain customers. We have introduced the industry\u2019s lowest commission rates of 0.04%.\u201D","South Korea watchdog warns financial firms on risk management https:\/\/t.co\/3SDNeJIw7H pic.twitter.com\/1Wva3s1JmV","\u2014 Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) February 5, 2024","","The platform is also trying to woo customers by offering lucrative points-type rewards programs.","Earlier, Han Chang-joon, the former Chief Financial Officer of Terraform Labs, was extradited to South Korea by police in Montenegro."],"entity":[{"type":"Upbit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Han Chang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Insight Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"October 4 last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bithumb","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Coinone","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Korbit","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korean","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"September last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bithumb","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Reuters Business (","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"51%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bithumb","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Upbit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.04%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"third quarter","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bithumb","Crypto Exchange"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
