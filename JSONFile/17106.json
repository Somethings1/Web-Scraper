It is currently exaggerating losses posted by market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH).","Bitcoin fell 3.2% over the last 24 hours and currently trades at $62,708. Nearest rival Ethereum fell 4.1% over the same period and changes hands at $2,993.","Ethereum\u2019s number one competitor as the blockchain for apps and DeFi, Solana ($SOL), posted heavier intraday losses of 8.1%, although at $145.71, that\u2019s still about 20% pricier than it was this time last week.¬†","Celestia\u2019s trading chart shows a token that has been in steady 55% decline since setting a new all-time high of $20.85 on February 10.","However, in spite of this, it has weathered crypto\u2019s headwinds well. It bottomed out above $8 before spending late April\/early May seesawing between $9 and $12.¬†","A relative strength index (RSI) of 34 and falling indicates a continuing selloff.","This is likely to depreciate the token further in the short-term.¬†","","With a market cap of nearly $2 billion Celestia\u2019s $TIA is the 60th biggest cryptocurrency in the world right now. It\u2019s also one of several eye-catching protocols ushering in a new generation of scalability.","That said, it appears to be a little more volatile than the market leaders. Most cryptocurrencies this year rallied in step with Bitcoin and posted all-time or recent highs in early-to-mid March while TIA had peaked in early February.","Investors wanting to track market movements are perhaps better served by the plethora of exciting new meme coins. By buying in early during the presale, crypto fans can advantage of some sweltering price pumps if their token goes viral on listing.","Solana\u2019s¬†Sealana ($SEAL) the all-American redneck seal has already raised over a quarter of a million dollars in a hilarious new week-old presale.¬†","#Sealana, making #Memecoins great again! üá∫üá∏","Manifesto\n1\u20E3 No Frogs üê∏\n2\u20E3 Less Hats üß¢\n3\u20E3 Many Whales üê≥\n4\u20E3 Zero Rugs üìâ\n5\u20E3 More $SEAL ü¶≠ pic.twitter.com\/FEImgpWxWz","\u2014 Sealana (@Sealana_Token) May 7, 2024","","Sealana is a spin on South Park\u2019s viral Gamer Guy, aka Fat Computer Nerd.","Gamer Guy appeared in the hit cartoon\u2019s side-splitting World of Warcraft episode and became a viral meme all on his own thanks to his milk-bottle glasses, screen-locked stare, messy room and gravity-defying girth.¬†","He has symbolized anyone from the legions of disgruntled keyboard warriors writing sharp, acerbic opinions in internet comments sections, to a kind of Everyman \u2013 a symbol of the idler in everyone.","Sealana is Web3\u2019s Everyman, beached at his desk and ballooning by the day.
