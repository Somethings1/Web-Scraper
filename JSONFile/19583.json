AI can be applied to various tasks such as problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns in data, and more.","AI is a very broad concept, blogs Buterin.","AI can be considered as being the set of algorithms that you create not by specifying them explicitly, \u201Cbut rather by stirring a big computational soup and putting in some kind of optimization pressure that nudges the soup toward producing algorithms with the properties that you want,\u201D adds Buterin.","The bottom line from Buterin is that both blockchains and AIs are becoming more powerful.","However, it remains  challenging to \u201Cget right applications that attempt to use blockchains and cryptographic techniques to create a \u2018singleton\u2019: a single decentralized trusted AI.\u201D","Buterin, a prolific blogger, proposed in December alternative methods aimed at simplifying the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s proof of stake design. The initiative is intended to address a potential systemic complexity within Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism.","The proposals center on reducing the number of signatures required per slot in the blockchain."],"entity":[{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MPC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AIs","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Artificial Intelligence","Ethereum","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
