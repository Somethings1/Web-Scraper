I assume that his sentencing will be completed before my trial but it may not be.\u201D","Mashinsky said that he understands the potential conflict of interests involved even though he does not think one exists, stressing that he is investing significant time and money in his lawyers.","The embattled former CEO disclosed that he consulted with an independent attorney on conflict of interest concerns.","The United States prosecutors raised concerns regarding conflict of interests arising from both criminal cases on Feb 6. In a court filing, prosecutors highlighted their fears to the judge, requesting a Curcio hearing to determine pending issues.","In such hearings, the court determines the extent of the flagged conflict of interest and orders a change of attorneys if a conflict exists. This aims to ensure a client gets the best legal representation without loyalty to someone else if cases can be linked.","In the pending cases, prosecutors say both parties had a history of business relationships before the collapse of the firms.","Mashinsky has previously admitted lending funds to Alameda Research, a subsidiary and sister company of FTX.","Mashinsky has also partially blamed Celsius\u2019s collapse on Alameda Research\u2019s actions before the FTX bankruptcy. Furthermore, prosecutors pointed to the talks about Bankman-Fried buying Celsius with plans to replace Mashinsky as CEO as potential conflict areas.","However, the government noted that the issues raised do not impact his rights and can be waived with his express consent. The judge adjourned the matter to hear from an attorney appointed to represent defendants on potential conflict cases under the Criminal Justice Act.","In another development, Bankman-Fried is expected in court tomorrow before District Judge Lewis Kaplan on similar issues."],"entity":[{"type":"United States Federal Judge","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marc Mukasey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 20, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Torrey Young","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Criminal Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alex Mashinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Samuel Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mashinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lewis Kaplan","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Celsius","FTX","Mashinsky"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
