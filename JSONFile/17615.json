I am truly mystified as to why it is enjoying a resurgence in popularity.\u201D","In July 2020, Hoskinson predicted that, in a year, \u201Cthere will be hundreds of assets running on Cardano, thousands of dapps [decentralized apps], tons of interesting projects and lots of unique use and utility.\u201D Back then, these claims were met with a grain of salt by industry observers.","Also, popular dapp trackers, such as DappRadar and Dapp.com do not provide any information about dapps on Cardano.","Hoskinson, a former prime mover and the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain protocol, left the project after what the media has labeled a \u201Cboardroom brawl\u201D in 2014, later setting up Cardano as a direct rival protocol.","And Hoskinson, with a touch of braggadocio, told Bloomberg that Cardano\u2019s blockchain security and governance protocols are \u201Csuperior to Ethereum,\u201D meaning they could be used for digital voting and supply chain tracking purposes.","Hoskinson stated,","\u201CMy goal is to run countries on this blockchain. I don\u2019t care about Uniswap and CryptoKitties and other things. It\u2019s a bubble, and it comes and it goes, like Pet Rocks and Beanie Babies. You can take your DeFi and you can run it on my system for 1\/100 to 1\/1000 of the cost.\u201D","And the network\u2019s ADA token has had a meteoric rise this year, currently sitting at number 6 in the top 10 tokens per market capitalization.","At the time of writing (09:37 UTC), ADA trades at USD 1 and is down by 8% in a day and 12% in a week, trimming its monthly gains to less than 9%. The price has skyrocketed by 3,755% in a year.","The Cardano chief added that he \u201Cdoesn\u2019t know why\u201D Cardano\u2019s value has been in the ascendency this year, and added that smart contract functionality was to roll out \u201Cthis year.\u201D","Ethereum developer Ryan Berckmans earlier this month told Cryptonews.com that the ADA hype could simply be the result of crypto community members thinking that Ethereum \u201Cdoesn\u2019t scale\u201D and speculating that \u201CCardano may be the answer.\u201D","Hoskinson\u2019s cause has been buoyed by some high-profile supporters, however, with veteran rock star Gene Simmons of Kiss mounting a very public and very impassioned defense of the token last month.\n___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Ethereum Developers On Why They Don\u2019t See Cardano & Binance Chain As Rivals\n\u2013 Cardano\u2019s Hoskinson Keeps Bashing Ethereum As ADA Outperforms ETH\n\u2013 Cardano Meets Mary as ADA Still Occupies 3rd Spot by Market Cap\n\u2013 Cardano Upgrades On Its Way To Offer Better Tokenization Than Ethereum"],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hoskinson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Castle Island Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Gene Simmons","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ryan Berckmans","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"See Cardano & Binance Chain As Rivals\n\u2013 Cardano\u2019s Hoskinson Keeps Bashing Ethereum As ADA Outperforms ETH\n\u2013 Cardano Meets Mary","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3,755%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nic Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Charles Hoskinson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Blockchain","Cardano","Ethereum"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
