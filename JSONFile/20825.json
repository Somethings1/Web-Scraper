They also sourced price data for bitcoin (BTC) markets on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bistamp, among others.","Per the study, on average, the traded volume in crypto derivatives markets exceeds the regular crypto spot markets by a factor of five.","\u201COur data show really small positions in these markets\u2014likely held by people with not a ton of experience\u2014being disproportionately liquidated\u201D as \u201Creally sophisticated people show up and have a significant edge over amateurs,\u201D according to Kyle Soska, a Ph.D. student in electrical and computer engineering and the study\u2019s lead author.","","Moreover, while smaller traders disproportionately account for liquidations, \u201Cchatbox evidence suggests that many users are obsessively trading 24\/7.\u201D","\u201CKorean traders seem to be active at all hours of the day, indicating that trading may be an all-consuming activity for many of them,\u201D the researchers said.","They added that \u201Cderivatives instruments attract a culture of long-biased highly leveraged speculators\u201D which makes BitMEX \u201Chome to many professional outfits that control thousands of bitcoins and manage dozens of accounts.\u201D","In \u201Caddition to retail speculators, BitMEX is utilized by highly sophisticated traders which echoes the claims made by a professional market marker about the usefulness of derivatives in cryptocurrency,\u201D the paper says.","\u201CAn example of a large cluster would be the one rooted from Bitcoin address 1KiJkugknjgW6AHXNgVQgNuo3b5DqsVFmk which owns 86 BitMEX accounts. This address has sent approximately 13,900 [USD 764.7m] bitcoins to BitMEX but has extracted over 72,100 bitcoins from it.\u201C","This said, the available market data shows that BitMEX accounts for a relatively minor share of total liquidations. Of the roughly USD 1.34bn worth of liquidations carried out in the past 24 hours (09:15 UTC), only USD 24.5m took place on the derivatives exchange, representing about 1.8% of the total.","\u201CAll of this raises concerns about the impact that derivatives have on BitMEX\u2019s customers and on the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. The flip side of the coin is that these phenomena, and possible responses to interventions, are far easier to measure in the context of cryptocurrencies, than they are in more traditional markets,\u201D the authors of the study concluded.","As reported on multiple occasions, long liquidations have become more numerous this year. With bitcoin (and other coins) breaking all-time highs nearly every passing week, some traders may feel unable to gain significant exposure without margin trading. However, a growing number of traders can\u2019t afford to maintain their leveraged positions in the event of dips. Hence, the growing frequency of big liquidations.","Leveraged trading refers to borrowing funds so that you can take a larger position than you would be able to with your existing funds so that you can potentially generate a higher profit. However, while margin trading enables traders to amplify their returns, it can also lead to increased losses and liquidations, which is why experienced traders tend to advise newcomers to stay away from leveraged trading.\n____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Almost USD 10 Billion Liquidated Amid Sunday Sell-off In Crypto Market\n\u2013 Institutions & Retail Compete For Bitcoin \u2013 Whose Hands Are Stronger?\n\u2013 This Is The Biggest Risk To Crypto Market According to Pantera Capital CIO\n\u2013 What Are Leveraged Tokens And Should You Trade Them?\n\u2013 Cryptoasset Margin Trading: How Safe is it?\n\u2013 7 Ways to Short Crypto\n\u2013 Crypto Traders Warn Newbies About New & Super Risky Binance Feature\n\u2013 5 Leverage Trading Platforms (for Experienced Margin Traders) in 2021"],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Market\n\u2013 Institutions & Retail Compete For Bitcoin \u2013 Whose Hands","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Carnegie Mellon University CyLab","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pantera Capital CIO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Short Crypto\n\u2013 Crypto Traders Warn Newbies About New & Super Risky Binance Feature\n\u2013 5 Leverage Trading Platforms","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kyle Soska","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Bitcoin","BitMEX","Bitstamp","Coinbase","Derivatives","Kraken","Trading"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
