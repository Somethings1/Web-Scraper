As of 3\/10\/24, $MSTR hodls 205,000 $BTC acquired for ~$6.91B at average price of $33,706 per bitcoin. https:\/\/t.co\/YayyKtpz8d","\u2014 Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) March 11, 2024","","That took the firm\u2019s holdings to 205,000 BTC tokens, currently valued at close to $15 billion. MicroStrategy\u2019s average purchase price is currently $33,706, so the firm is currently sat on more than 2x gains.","Assuming MicroStrategy is able to raise the full $500 million and buy BTC at the current market rate of just over $73,000, its BTC stash could be about to jump another 6,850.","MicroStrategy\u2019s decision to jump back into the market with another private offering demonstrates how strong the firm deems market conditions to be right now. Trading at around $73,000, Bitcoin is at its highest-ever levels, having rallied nearly 75% already this year.","MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price, meanwhile, is up nearly 3x since the start of the year. Some analysts had warned MSTR investors that the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs would lead to MSTR outflows, as investors who had bought the stock for BTC exposure migrated to the new ETFs.","But that hasn\u2019t been the case at all. MicroStrategy\u2019s ability to employ leverage (raising its beta versus Bitcoin) as well as a yield has kept investors interested.","The firm\u2019s recent moves to further increase leverage via private offers of senior convertible notes has attracted even more interest with MSTR up 150% in under three weeks. No doubt plenty of other public companies will be looking at MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC strategy in awe."],"entity":[{"type":"$6.91","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$821.7","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$73,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 11, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"MSTR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$MSTR","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$821.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$500 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"150%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$15 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2031","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$33,706","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$68,477","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","MicroStrategy","mstr"],"authors":["Joel Frank"]}
