Russian energy providers have been cracking down on illegal mining operations in recent months, an indication that their tolerance threshold for home-based miners may already be low.","Industrial miners will also be obliged to provide reports on their activities to Rosfinmonitoring, the nation\u2019s anti-money laundering agency.","Interestingly, perhaps, Gorelkin also made remarks about industrial miners being allowed to sell coins \u201Cwithout the use of Russian information infrastructure.\u201D","This could be a reference to overseas crypto exchanges. Previous efforts to regulate crypto mining in Russia centered around the idea of forcing domestic firms to sell their coins on foreign trading platforms.","The Central Bank thinks that this policy would help keep crypto \u201Cout of the domestic economy.\u201D","The bank has made this a priority demand, as it attempts to fast-track its digital ruble project.","Exclusive: As China's big banks pull back from financing Russia-related transactions, some Chinese companies are turning to small banks on the border and underground financing channels such as money brokers and banned cryptocurrency https:\/\/t.co\/GLmIBNPaHR","\u2014 Reuters (@Reuters) April 29, 2024","","The bill also appears to hand a certain degree of power to energy providers and local government bodies.","In the past, officials in mining hotspots like Irkutsk have complained that miners are placing excessive pressure on their grids.","Gorelkin explained that the proposed law \u201Cincludes the possibility of giving the Russian government the right to ban mining activities in certain regions.\u201D","However, he conceded, there is still much to \u201Cdebate\u201D about the possible \u201Cterms and scope\u201D of such \u201Cbans.\u201D","Cryptominers rack up big B5m unpaid electricity bill https:\/\/t.co\/fbR8ywG3Uc","\u2014 Malcolm Carter (@MalcolmThailand) April 29, 2024","","Russian law experts expressed mixed opinions about the news. RBC quoted Yuri Brisov, a partner at the legal consultancy Digital and Analogue Partners, as noting that lawmakers have tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to regulate mining before.","The latest effort appears to be the result of intensive lobbying from the industrial mining sector.","And despite talk of adopting the bill in time for a September rollout, Brisov said that lawmakers would need to revise the draft law before a vote. He explained:","\u201CThis bill is already the eighth attempt to create a mining law. It is very crude, even the definition of mining is hastily set out. The writing is terrible. There is little chance that it will be accepted in its current form.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"Irkutsk","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gorelkin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"State Duma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 29, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Malcolm Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Analogue Partners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moscow","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Yuri Brisov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"RBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State Duma Committee on Information Policy Anton Gorelkin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Brisov","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Mining","Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
