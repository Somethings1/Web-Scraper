The tokenized deposits were transacted using encryption, ensuring privacy and security. They could be viewed on blockchain explorers but didn\u2019t reveal the identity of participants, balances, or transaction amounts to non-bank users.","However, Visa expressed its commitment to further exploring the use of tokenized deposits in various areas, including tokenized asset markets and programmable finance.","For example, in the \u201CProperty Payments\u201D use case, tokenized deposits could automate payments to property developers upon reaching the completion date of a contract, minimizing delays in the closing process.","As part of its key findings, Visa wrote:","\u201CThe time to final settlement for an interbank transfer, as confirmed through our pilot\u2019s testing between the banks, was near real-time. Tokenized deposits were burned on the sending bank\u2019s ledger, minted on the receiving bank\u2019s ledger, and simultaneously settled interbank via the simulated wholesale CBDC layer.\u201D","As a result of the successful pilot program, the e-HKD initiative will move into Phase 2.","In May, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) selected Visa as one of 16 firms from the financial, payment, and technology sectors to participate in the first round of e-HKD pilots for 2023.","The HKMA initiated the e-HKD pilot program in November 2022 to assess the commercial viability of an in-house central bank digital currency (CBDC) as part of its \u201CFintech 2025\u201D strategy.","In the first phase, the program studied several areas, including full-fledged payments, programmable payments, offline payments, tokenized deposits, and the settlement of Web3 transactions and tokenized assets.","The findings from the phase one trial highlighted the potential benefits of programmability, tokenization, and atomic settlement for Hong Kong\u2019s CBDC, benefiting consumers and businesses.","The e-HKD project follows a three-rail approach, with Rail 1 laying the technological and legal foundations for the e-HKD, Rail 2 exploring use cases and conducting pilots, and Rail 3 focusing on the launch of the e-HKD based on the results of the previous phases.","Additionally, the HKMA has been collaborating with central and commercial banks through Project mBridge to develop solutions for faster, more cost-effective, and transparent cross-border payments.","On September 25, HKMA CEO Eddie Yue revealed that mBridge would expand and be commercialized as it welcomed new banking members from China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates."],"entity":[{"type":"HSBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong Monetary Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Eddie Yue","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hang Seng Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United Arab Emirates","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fintech","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thailand","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September 25","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"HKMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","Hong Kong","Visa"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
