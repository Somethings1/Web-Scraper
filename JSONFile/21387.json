The problem is that in Web3, getting that data is tricky. Where are your customers coming from, what are they doing? This is basic stuff in Web2. It\u2019s Marketing 101. But in Web3, you have off-chain behavior and on-chain behavior, and it\u2019s hard to connect the two.","Enter Cookie3, which describes itself as \u201Cthe first open MarketingFi economy shared between users, creators, and businesses.\u201D Cookie3 is many things, including: A Web3 marketing ecosystem intended to connect creators to advertisers, a tool for KOL (key online influencers) to quantify their reputation, and, most of all, an AI-powered data analytics tool that lets projects understand both off-chain and on-chain marketing behavior.","This interview is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.","\u201CYou can think of it as an Google Analytics alternative,\u201D says Filip Wielanier, Cookie3\u2019s co-founder and CEO, who has a background in both IT and digital marketing at Deloitte. Using the Cookie3 plug-in, Web3 projects can understand customers\u2019 ROI, lifetime value, and contribution to on-chain progress. Wielanier explains how Cookie3 analytics work, why this data is crucial for any project, and why Web3 marketing is a \u201Cwin-win situation for everyone, because the creators are building much more engaged communities.\u201D","Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.","What are some of the biggest advantages in Web3 marketing over Web2 marketing?","Filip Wielanier: In Web3, you have the ability to directly communicate and incentivize your contributors. And you can decentralize what\u2019s called \u201Cpublishers\u201D in Web2. You can make them your own ambassadors. You can also collaborate with other creators who contribute directly to your ecosystem, and also to provide them value directly, which is very hard to do in Web2 marketing. And this is exactly why we created Cookie3 Affiliate -- to provide it in an automated and permission-less way. You can think of Cookie3 Affiliate as a kind of matchmaking between the creators and advertisers.","You mentioned the Cookie3 Affiliate program, but what\u2019s the overall vision of Cookie3?","The current vision is to provide the fair value distribution between different stakeholders including retail individuals, creators, and companies. We\u2019re creating the whole ecosystem to provide that for everyone. Right now in crypto, specifically, some groups of insiders have a huge advantage in terms of information, and we want to open this up to the whole market.","I love this in theory, but can you give an example to make it more concrete?","Sure. So basically, we\u2019re the data company. We use an AI data layer, specifically, and we\u2019re working on different solutions including a user analytics platform -- Cookie3 analytics. You can kind of think of this as a Google Analytics alternative. We help people understand flows such as user attribution, transactions, and conversions on-chain. The two worlds of off-chain and on-chain data are pretty hard to be measured together, and we\u2019re providing that information in one place.","Got it. So who are your main end-users, generally? Projects or companies looking to better understand their customers?","Yeah. So we are B2B2C. [Business to business to consumer.] So any DeFi platform, DEX, or gamify platform -- you name it -- that wants to onboard users needs to optimize their spending on marketing. And they\u2019d like to tailor their communications to specific groups of users. Thanks to our insights, they can finally understand who\u2019s actually using their platform, what are the flows, what are the attribution sources. You can see the ROI of marketing campaigns. And in the Web3 world, we have a challenging environment because there\u2019s off-chain attribution and then on-chain conversions, and it\u2019s hard to measure that together.","Can you give a concrete example of how this kind of insight can help a project?","We\u2019ve got this amazing use case of our client Notum. They managed to decrease their marketing cost by 64%. They thought they were doing well because they had a lot of people come in, but once they looked at the on-chain data, they saw that the people they were attributing had very low amount of tokens and liquidity in their wallets, and obviously that's not who you want logging into your platform. These users were not generating value or revenue.","So they looked at other channels that might bring in a lower quantity of people, but people who are more valuable users. They completely stopped putting money into users who weren\u2019t bringing value. Vanity metrics only get you so far.","Vanity metrics?","A vanity metric is, for example, when you\u2019re doing an airdrop and you have a lot of bots follow your Twitter and your numbers look amazing. It\u2019s a vanity project.","I\u2019m glad you mentioned bots. How do you handle the problem of bots when you\u2019re analyzing data? And I\u2019m guessing this is now even more complicated in the world of AI?","Yeah, so I won\u2019t tell you the exact details of that, because once I tell you that\u2026","It\u2019s your secret sauce!","[Both laugh.]","But you know, it\u2019s this constant chase. They [bad actors] are chasing up. We\u2019re chasing them, basically. And there are plenty of [actors] who are just abusing certain metrics and behaviors to get some airdrops, for example, and to drain valuable from an airdrop campaign. These are real risks, because we are sometimes talking about multiple millions worth of tokens. In terms of how we\u2019re approaching that, it\u2019s very custom.","What are these bad actors doing exactly?","The attackers are creating multiple accounts that are focused on attacking specific protocols, or interacting with specific smart contracts to get some incentives or airdrops in the upcoming airdrop campaign. This is the most common use case in Sybil bots and Sybil attacks. They can create multiple, sometimes thousands or even tens of thousands of wallets.","You\u2019re almost having to act as a cyber-security firm, on top of data analytics?","Kind of. And especially with the adoption of different AI solutions, it\u2019s getting even harder because these Sybils are much more advanced and much more sophisticated than they were even a year ago. So it\u2019s this constant race of chasing each other, because we\u2019re using machine learning models to detect them. And they are using other models to not get detected.","And by the time our call is over, it will have evolved once again.","Yeah. So this is the actual environment and status quo that we\u2019re living in. This is why projects like Worldcoin are great examples that Proof of Humanity is very needed in the future, because AIs are getting more sophisticated in their behaviors.","One of the taglines on your web page is \u201CMarketingFi Protocol & AI Data Layer.\u201D What does \u201CAI data layer\u201D mean exactly?","This is the thing we\u2019re specializing in. We\u2019re a data company and we\u2019re providing those data points from different angles including on-chain. It\u2019s kind of like Google Analytics data. And once a platform integrates into our analytics plugin, they have all the data play with and understand the behavior of their users.","Can you give another example of an insight that a company could glean from using all this?","Yeah, sure. So basically, any Mention or Like [on social media] can be measured. If anyone is digitally talking about or promoting your product, you can see the outcome of that. This could apply to marketing activities like advertisements, or collaborations with influencers, or quest platforms. Thanks to us, basically, you can see the real out come -- not just in terms of the number of visits or the time that folks spend on your website coming from a specific source and spending an exact amount of money, but you can actually see the real outcome to your protocol. Thanks to on-chain stats, you can check and see how much liquidity came from different sources. You can finally calculate the ROI and customer acquisition cost and customer lifetime value. These are pretty fundamental metrics in the Web2 marketing world, but not so common in Web3 because they are just hard to measure.","Let\u2019s finish with the Web3 vision of how decentralized creators can connect with consumers, instead of using Google or Facebook. Can you give an example of how this works?","Sure. So basically, there\u2019s the advertiser that defines the campaign. Defines the conversion event, defines the reward for the conversion event. Then there\u2019s a publisher -- in this case the creator -- that decides whether he or she would like to participate. And then he's promoting the product to get some conversions, and per each conversion -- which is being verified by our verification engine -- a smart contract is paying out rewards to the creator. And those rewards can be also cost-shared with the end user. This is just one concrete example, but there are many others.","And on top of that, thanks to the blockchain, you can even reward your communities if they are engaging you. It's a win-win situation for everyone, because the creators are building much more engaged communities, thanks to this value-sharing approach.\u201D","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"MarketingFi Protocol & AI Data Layer","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ROI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"64%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sybil","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sybil","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Filip Wielanier","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Deloitte","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google Analytics","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","Consensus 2024","Web3 Marketing 2024"],"authors":["Jeff Wilser"]}
