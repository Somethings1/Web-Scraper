At least 10 other people are also being questioned in connection with the incident.","Officers say that the gang created a group chat room on a social media platform. They allegedly called the group the \u201CInvestment Reading Room\u201D and managed to lure a number of unsuspecting crypto-curious social media users to join.","The police explained that the alleged masterminds sought to \u201Cdeceive\u201D members of the chat by enlisting \u201Cfake investors\u201D to join the group. These individuals \u201Cpretended to be professional investment advisors\u201D or people who had made massive gains by investing in crypto.","At least 10 people appear to have been duped by the ruse: They initially invested small amounts, which they saw yield high returns \u2013 with the masterminds providing payouts. But they were then convinced to part ways with much larger sums of cash, which they hoped to see mushroom into huge profits.","But this was the point where the money appeared to dry up \u2013 and the investors allegedly found themselves unable to withdraw their stakes.","The 26-year-old is thought to have been the operation\u2019s kingpin, but the police believe that a number of other individuals \u201Csystematically committed\u201D crimes to help the operation run smoothly.\n\nPolice described the alleged victims as ranging from \u201Ccollege students\u201D with an interest in crypto to \u201Cbeginner investors\u201D and even \u201Chousewives.\u201D\n\nA police spokesperson urged citizens to be cautious about crypto investment, and explained:","\u201CThere is a high likelihood that promises of investments that yield high returns will turn out to be fraudulent.\u201D","In September, a crypto fraudster who tricked victims out of around $1.7 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and fiat was given a five-year jail sentence. And in nearby Japan last month, two men in their thirties explained that they were duped by chat app-based fraudsters who ran a fake crypto exchange."],"entity":[{"type":"$472,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Fraud","Police","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
