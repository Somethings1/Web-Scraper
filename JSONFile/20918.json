The social media network launched in 1999 and enjoyed enormous popularity in the early 2000s, with some 25% of the nation believed to be active Cyworld users at its peak toward the end of the decade. It was bought out by business conglomerate SK in 2003, and its popularity spread to China and other Asian nations.","A data leak and the rise of non-domestic social media platforms led to a sharp decline after 2011, though, and the firm was eventually sold off to Aire in 2016.","Under new ownership, Cyworld then tried to launch a crypto business, raising almost USD 0.5m in token sales for a token named Cling \u2013 before seeing prices bottom out.","A bitter struggle over unpaid wages to scores of employees then broke out before the company was eventually sold off to the consortium, which has now unveiled plans to rebrand it as Cyworld Z.","The consortium has created a new Ethereum-based token named Dotori (Acorn), which, media outlets report, they hope to list on \u201Cone of the country\u2019s top three crypto exchanges.\u201D","Hanguk Kyungjae, though, quotes an unnamed crypto exchange employee as stating that their platform had \u201Cnever held any discussions with Cyworld.\u201D","Nevertheless, the consortium has reportedly received over USD 7 million worth of backing from investors, and plans a \u201CCyworld 3.0\u201D PC version launch next month, as well as a mobile rollout in the first half of 2021.\n___\nLearn more:\nA Look Into the Trending Decentralized Social Media Experience: Mastodon\nETH Prices Barely Budge Despite Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Reddit Deal\nTrump vs. Twitter Fight Reignites Social Media Decentralization Vision"],"entity":[{"type":"2003","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mastodon\nETH Prices Barely Budge Despite Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Reddit Deal\nTrump vs. Twitter Fight Reignites Social Media Decentralization Vision","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hanguk Kyungjae","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2011","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Acorn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the first half of 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1999","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cyworld Z.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2000s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aire","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Altcoins","Social media","South Korea","Tokenization"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
