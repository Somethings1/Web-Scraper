Ethereum supporters are excited about the upgrade, which should improve the network\u2019s efficiency and reduce its environmental impact. ","However, Ethereum miners, whose earnings are at stake following the upgrade given that it would remove the need for miners to secure the network, are not seemingly happy. To keep their income, they are advertising for a potential continued \u201CETH PoW\u201D (\u201CEthereum proof-of-work\u201D) chain post-upgrade. ","The Ethereum mastermind claimed that those pushing for a fork are mostly \u201Ca couple of outsiders that basically have exchanges and most just want to make a quick buck.\u201D ","\u201CSo, I\u2019m not expecting it to have substantial long-term adoption, just because I think Ethereum Classic [ETC] already has a superior community and superior product for people pro-proof-of-work,\u201D noting that still there might be \u201Ca couple of splats\u201D as Ethereum shifts. ","Buterin was also quoted as saying that if a PoW fork turns out to be a success, a lot of decentralized applications would have \u201Cto choose one way or the other,\u201D which could cause a lot of market confusion and problems: \u201CI hope that whatever happens doesn\u2019t lead to people losing money.\u201D","While there might be different attempts to fork the Ethereum blockchain, one that has already found some traction is called EthereumPOW. Spearheaded by Guo, the attempt reportedly has the support of several Chinese companies manufacturing Ethereum mining equipment. (As reported, in July, Bitmain launched its new Ethereum mining rig, AntMiner E9, despite Ethereum\u2019s move to PoS.)","Meanwhile, even this attempt ostensibly does not have a big community of supporters. For example, looking at their donation address, it received less than USD 3,000 in ETH in six days. ","Literally nobody will use that shit. Its just to generate money for yourself lol.\nWhy pay high gasfees if I can do transactions gasless?","In either case, some exchanges have already indicated that they\u2019re going to use this potential ETH fork to increase their trading revenues.","Bitcoin Cash futures started trading before Bitcoin Cash existed, if my memory is correct","At 09:43 UTC, ETH trades at USD 1,774 and is up 5% in a day and a week. It\u2019s also up 44% in a month. Meanwhile, ETC, which gained traction with miners pledging to move to it after The Merge, is up 150% in the past month. ETC trades at USD 39 and is also up 4% in a day and almost 8% in a week.","___\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Justin Sun, Poloniex Back Plan to Create a PoW Ethereum Hard Fork\n\u2013 Hayes Asks \u2018Forgiveness\u2019 for Calling Ethereum a Shitcoin, Doubles Down on ETH\n\n\u2013 If Ethereum Splits, Leading Exchanges are \u2018Likely\u2019 to List ETHPoW Token \u2013 BitMEX\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin says The Merge is Not \u2018Priced in\u2019 as Investor Promises to Fork Ethereum\n\n\u2013 6 Key Points in Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Vision for Ethereum Presented at EthCC\n\u2013 Ethereum Classic Rallies Again, Outperforms Ethereum YTD \u2013 But What Does History Show?"],"entity":[{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Justin Sun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"44%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"past weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AntMiner E9","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EthCC\n\u2013 Ethereum Classic Rallies Again","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"150%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Chandler Guo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Guo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Vision","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Ethereum Classic","Hard fork","Mining","Proof-of-stake","Vitalik Buterin"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
