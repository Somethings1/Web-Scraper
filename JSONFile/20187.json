But since Nakamoto\u2019s writing style appears to be different in forums and email correspondences, this suggests multiple individuals were involved. ","A linguistic analysis of Nakamoto\u2019s forum posts revealed varying writing styles, further supporting the theory of a collective behind the pseudonym, the report said. ","The timestamps on Nakamoto\u2019s messages also hint at the involvement of multiple individuals. ","There are theories regarding Nakamoto\u2019s location, with some suggesting that the Bitcoin mastermind lived in the UK while others found that he resided in California. ","A review titled \u201CThe Time Zones of Satoshi Nakamoto\u201D analyzed Nakamoto\u2019s hourly activity and concluded that Nakamoto likely resided in the EST time zone. ","If Nakamoto is indeed a group, it would explain the possibility of multiple time zones being involved.","The breadth of knowledge displayed by Nakamoto is another indicator that he may be a collective. ","The creator demonstrates proficiency in computer science, mathematics, flawless English, game theory, and the successful concealment of his identity for over a decade. ","It raises doubts as to how a single individual could possess such a diverse skill set while remaining anonymous.","Despite these compelling theories and details, there is no concrete evidence to confirm that Nakamoto is a group. ","Nevertheless, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto continues to remain unknown, making the saga of Bitcoin\u2019s creator continues to be one of the most intriguing mysteries in the world of cryptocurrency."," "],"entity":[{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Time Zones","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nakamoto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Satoshi Nakamoto"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
