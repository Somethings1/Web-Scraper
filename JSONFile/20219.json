OP Price Drops 4%, While Experts Are Stocking Up On This New GambleFi Token","category":["Industry Talk "],"content":["The native token for Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution Optimism (OP) has fallen 4% in the last 24 hours amidst a market-wide pullback that has hit Layer 2 tokens the hardest.","Optimism currently trades at a price of $2.39. This is down about 1% in the last hour. It also represents a 3.7% dip both in the last 24 hours and in the last seven days, according to data by CoinGecko.","The token is 7.2% more valuable than it was this time last week. However, today\u2019s price represents a steep drop of 35% from a month ago.","Zooming out to the rest of the market, crypto\u2019s total market capitalization today is a lofty $2.39 trillion, which represents a fall of about 1.6% in the last 24 hours.","As usual, the market is tracking the price movements of its leading coins. Original cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) is the only cryptocurrency with a market cap above $1 trillion ($1.2 trillion, to be precise). In the last 24 hours, it fell 0.8% and currently trades at $61,760.","It\u2019s closest competitor, the most commercially-important cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), faced markedly heavier losses. ETH fell 3.8% overnight and currently changes hands at $3,050.¬†","Optimism\u2019s heavier depreciation is matched by other leading layer 2 solutions today. Polygon (MATIC) fell 4.3% overnight to trade at $0.6735. Stacks (STX) dipped 2.1% to $2.33, Mantle (MNTL) shed 5.4% to $0.9762, and Arbitrum (ARB) lost 3.9% to $1.02.¬†","The risk-off attitude kickstarting this week could be down to investors\u2019 jitters over this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting.¬† The U.S. central bank has given indications that it may keep interest rates¬†higher for longer, which¬†means investors are more likely to take risk-averse positions to speculative investments like crypto.","Optimism\u2019s trading chart for the last three months shows a steady 50% depreciation since the token posted an all-time high of $4.84 on March 6 this year amidst a market-wide rally. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 35 and falling, there\u2019s likely to be further losses today as the small overnight sell-off continues.¬†","As crypto adoption continues apace, Layer 2s are becoming more of a safer investment. To date, Ethereum dominates 63.42% of the market with over $54.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) on the blockchain.","However, Layer 2 protocol tokens are closely tied to the fate of their leader, Ethereum. On a good day, Layer 2 tokens rise in tandem, and vice versa, as we can see today.","One sector that\u2019s getting more of a look-in nowadays is the world of GambleFi. Investors that want a head start on Web3\u2019s newest innovations early are more likely to find heady upside potential in tokens attached to crypto-integrated iGaming platforms, like Mega Dice.","The Mega Dice ($DICE) presale is barely a fortnight old and it has already taken $600,000 in investments, according to the token\u2019s website.","Introducing Refer & Earn with $DICE! üöÄüí∞","Exciting news!
