But following a winter that was blighted by crypto mining-related power shortages, the government resolved to force bitcoin (BTC) and crypto miners to pay more. ","The government began to bemoan the fact that miners were paying \u201Cnegligible\u201D taxes on their earnings back in February and last month sought to make changes to the tax code.","The country\u2019s finance ministry argued that in the first quarter of the current financial year, miners paid more than USD 15m in tax.","The new tax measure, which was signed into law by Tokayev on Monday, will operate on a sliding scale. As such, instead of paying a flat rate per unit of energy consumed, users who pay a higher price for electricity will pay a maximum of USD 0.052 per kWH of tax, while consumers who pay less for electricity will pay as little as USD 0.002 per kWh consumed. ","As energy prices tend to vary throughout the year, this will mean that as power prices rise in the nation, so too will miners\u2019 tax bills. ","Most miners operate in the nation\u2019s capital Nur-Sultan, which was formerly known as Astana.","But there is good news for miners who go off the grid: miners using their own power sources will be taxed at a rate of around USD 0.02 per kWh.","Meanwhile, those who can use renewable power sources in their mining efforts will be obliged to pay tax rates of just 0.002 per kWh.","The government has indicated that it is prepared to crack down hard on illegal and unregistered miners. Earlier this year, it introduced a legal requirement forcing all miners to register with a central body and provide detailed reports on their operations.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 New Taxes Await for Kazakhstan\u2019s Beleaguered Bitcoin and Crypto Miners\n\u2013 Another Headache for Bitcoin Miners in Central Asia as Three Countries Hit With Blackouts\n\n\u2013 Kazakhstan Teaches Bitcoin Miners a Lesson as Chaos Affects BTC Hashrate\n\u2013 Kazakh President Says Government Must Make \u2018Favorable\u2019 Conditions for Crypto Industry Development\n\n\u2013 Kazakhstan Develops New Program to Team Up Crypto Exchanges with Banks\n\u2013 Kazakhstan Central Bank Exploring \u2018Opportunities in Crypto, DeFi \u2018Innovation\u2019"],"entity":[{"type":"Sultan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Miners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Miners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Industry Development\n\n\u2013 Kazakhstan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 1, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Astana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kazakhstan Teaches Bitcoin Miners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Banks\n\u2013 Kazakhstan Central Bank Exploring","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kazakhstan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kassym","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jomart Tokayev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Central Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"last month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Mining","Tax"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
