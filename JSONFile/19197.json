With its unique Layer 1 network architecture, it processes over 710,000 transactions per second, enabling the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) for various use cases, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) marketplaces. Unlike Ethereum, Solana does not require additional scaling solutions, relying on powerful computers for network maintenance and data storage. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is essential for transactions and network security through staking.","On March 18, the market capitalization of Solana cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high of $92.5 billion, surpassing its previous peak of around $77.9 billion recorded in November 2021. On March 21, the Solana network also updated its record for the daily number of new addresses on the blockchain. The number of daily new addresses reached 1.61 million.","Solana\u2019s daily active addresses reached 2.4 million, outperforming all other chains \u2014 a new high for Solana since June 2021.","Solana\u2019s daily transaction volume fluctuated during the month, rising slightly from 27.9 million on March 1 to 29.1 million on March 28. During the last two days of the month, this number dropped to 23.3 million.","Solana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) reached $4.9 billion in March, representing a 96% increase compared to February 2024.","SOL is the native cryptocurrency fueling the Solana ecosystem, used for transaction fees and staking to secure the network, with its value influenced by the ecosystem\u2019s growth and market dynamics.","While the crypto markets experienced a bit of a pullback, the SOL price continued to rise throughout March. Starting at $135 on March 1, SOL\u2019s price quickly approached $205 on March 28 \u2014 for the first time since December 2021 \u2014 and closed the month at nearly $200.","Solana\u2019s meme coin mania also pushed on-chain volumes and fees to new highs. Volume on Solana exceeded $3.79 billion on March 15. On March 16, Solana\u2019s total trading volume soared past Ethereum, reaching $3.52 billion and beating out the daily volume on the Ethereum network by more than $1.1 billion, per DefiLlama.","Total fees on Solana were also at new all-time highs. The total transaction fees paid on Solana on March 18 amounted to $4.9 million \u2014 the vast majority of which was non-vote priority fees.","Moreover, since March 9, Solana has overtaken Ethereum to become the number one blockchain for stablecoin transfer volume. Data from blockchain analytics platform Artemis showed that Solana\u2019s stablecoin transfer volume reached a new high of $112.9 billion on March 28, surpassing the Ethereum network, which reported only $17.6 billion.¬†","Not surprisingly, Solana was searched for more globally than ever before, according to Google data. Google Trends\u2019 weekly tracker of a keyword\u2019s popularity shows that global interest in Solana hit a five-year high of 100 on March 10 and 16, surpassing the previous peak in the last week of December 2023.","According to CoinGecko Research, Solana has also been declared the most popular blockchain so far in 2024, accounting for 49.3% of global crypto investor interest in chain-specific narratives.","","The estate of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX will sell its remaining 41 million Solana, worth $7.7 billion at the time of publication, to institutional investors for around $60, while the current SOL market price is around $188. Neptune Digital announced the acquisition of 26,964 SOL at $64 per token, with 20% to be unlocked in March 2025 and the remainder on a monthly basis until 2028.","Among other institutional investors is also Pantera Capital, a major crypto hedge fund with $5.2 billion in assets under management, which is seeking to raise funds for the potential acquisition of SOL from FTX, according to a March 7 Bloomberg report. Bloomberg reports that FTX holds around 41.1 million SOL tokens, accounting for 10% of the total Solana circulating supply and valued at approximately $5.4 billion. The potential sale of these tokens could provide vital funds for compensating investors affected by the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy.","Coca-Cola HBC, a key partner of the Coca-Cola Company, partnered with Solana-based platform ALL.ART to implement blockchain-based employee certification. Students or trainees will be required to digitally sign the certificate themselves, creating a permanent aspect of the NFT\u2019s metadata and enhancing security and authenticity.","Institutional staking services provider Figment Europe and Apex Group are preparing to launch Solana (SOL) staking exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the SIX Swiss Exchange via Issuance.Swiss AG. This product, Figment Solana Plus Staking Rewards (SOLF), will be tailored to provide institutions with easy access to staking rewards through traditional brokers or banks within a familiar ETP framework.","A new virtual smartphone app, Aphone, was launched on Solana\u2019s blockchain and Aethir\u2019s decentralized cloud infrastructure, targeting people with older hardware and those in developing countries. Aphone allows users to interact with resource-intensive apps and games, regardless of their device\u2019s capabilities, and aims to provide access to Web3 concepts and applications to a wider audience.¬†","APhone\u2019s Features üåê","Ready to ditch the data giants?

This event is important for Solana, as it signifies Killabears as the first major gaming project to commence a migration from Ethereum.","","Solana ecosystem coins are digital assets that operate on the Solana blockchain, which is known for its high throughput and low transaction costs. These coins can represent a wide range of applications and services, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other blockchain-based projects, all leveraging Solana\u2019s fast and efficient network infrastructure. There is also significant interest in Solana meme coins.","Solana\u2019s meme coins have been in a frenzy as part of the recent crypto bull run.","Slerf (SLERF), the meme coin of the Solana-based NFT community Bozo Collective, saw a surge despite a major pre-launch glitch on March 18. After a $10.8 million SOL pre-sale, a glitch resulted in the liquidity pool (LP) and 50% of the token supply being burned.","This sparked controversy, but the reduced supply fueled a buying frenzy that pushed SLERF to $1.28 and a market cap of $500 million within three hours. MEXC, CoinEx, and Bitget quickly listed SLERF. The developer admitted the LP burn was a mistake and went on X to address 10,000 listeners. Despite the debate, SLERF\u2019s early performance broke records and boosted Solana\u2019s DEX volume.","Dogwifhat (WIF), a dog-themed meme coin, became the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization on March 29, surpassing Pepe (PEPE). The WIF price skyrocketed to an all-time high of $4,8 on March 31 as meme coin fans raised over $700,000 to advertise the token\u2019s logo on the Las Vegas sphere. Major exchanges such as Binance and Robinhood Europe listed WIF, which also pushed up its price.","Jeo Boden (BODEN), a Solana meme coin parody of U.S. President Joe Biden launched on March 9, also hit its new record, surpassing $325 million in market cap on March 28.","On March 18, the Milady NFT collection joined the meme coin craze as well and released the Solana-based meme coin, Milady Wif Hat (LADYF), named after the popular Solana meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF). The meme coin attracted 91,486 SOL ($18.6 million) within two hours of its pre-sale announcement.","Similarly, a pseudonymous art producer (@darkfarms on X) launched a new Solana meme coin, Book of Memes (BOME), on March 14 through a rapid 24-hour presale that garnered over 10,000 SOL. This event created an immediate buzz, prompting centralized exchanges such as Bingx, MEXC, Poloniex, and HTX to quickly list BOME, soon followed by Kucoin, Binance, and Bybit. Within just 36 hours, the market capitalization of this meme coin skyrocketed to $1.4 billion.","Another meme coin SMOG has also been making waves and is positioned to soar onto centralized exchanges (CEX) in the near future. Despite its recent retracement to $0.20 on March 31st from fleeting highs of $0.36 on March 8th, SMOG experienced a remarkable uptrend, reflecting a 233% increase over the last month.¬†","The meme coin frenzy helped Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) top the charts in trading volume.","On March 27, Solana\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) Jupiter allocated $10 million in USDC and $100 million in its native JUP token to launch its Jupiter DAO. The allocation is intended to provide the DAO with the resources to support ideas using USDC and to adjust the JUP allocation for long-term incentive alignment with JUP contributors.¬†","Jupiter DAO also introduced a new voting system that changes the dynamics of community engagement and decision-making within the ecosystem.

The token has reached an all-time high of $1.6 and is up 220% since. The market cap of JUP has also surpassed $1.6 billion.","In March, Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem was also enhanced with the introduction of Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), which is now operational on Solana\u2019s main net. This means that Solana developers can now natively exchange USDC tokens from Ethereum and other EVM-compatible ecosystems, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Optimism, and Polygon. It will also be compatible with non-EVM blockchains. Solana ecosystem players such as Jupiter Exchange, Allbridge, Drift Protocol, Solend, Wormhole, and others have already integrated support for CCTP.¬†","1\/ @Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol is now live on Solana!","Fast, frictionless flows of USDC to Solana from 8 blockchain networks across 56 unique routes are now possible üî•","All you need to know about #CCTPüëáüßµ https:\/\/t.co\/3InoRf83H8","\u2014 Solana (@solana) March 26, 2024","","IO Research, creator of the Solana-based decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) Io.net, raised $30 million at a $1 billion valuation.
