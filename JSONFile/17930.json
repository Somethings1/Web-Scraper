Musk is now openly showing his support for so-called joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin, which grew much larger than anyone had initially expected, and the team behind the coin bestowed the honorary title \u201CCEO of Dogecoin\u201D upon him \u2013 at least for a while.","The star entrepreneur seems to be swayed by the perks of cryptocurrencies: only a year ago, he was saying that he owned \u201Czero cryptocurrency\u201D after his persona was copied to fake accounts which tried to scam people out of money. He\u2019s been taking a more favorable stance towards crypto in the coming months, and he notably said that \u201Cthe Bitcoin structure is quite brilliant\u201D and crypto is a far better way to transfer value.","Two days ago, presumably as part of an April Fools joke, Dogecoin\u2019s official Twitter account started a poll: \u201CWe have listened to your concerns. We have decided that Dogecoin does need a CEO. Someone who can lead us into the future while maintaining the core values of what we are. Below are the candidates, vote wisely.\u201D Among the options were smart contract platform Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, cryptocurrency Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, Marshall Hayes, CEO and co-founder of payments processing platform Metal, and Musk himself.","As Musk took the majority of the votes, people brought the tweet to his attention, to which he replied, \u201CDogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It\u2019s pretty cool,\u201D which, expectedly, generated a lot of hype in the community. Dogecoin\u2019s official Twitter account immediately replied, \u201CLooks like you\u2019re the CEO now [Elon Musk], DM us where to email the access codes :-D\u201D","Musk\u2019s position as CEO lasted just long enough for him to potentially update his CV with the new experience, which is to say, around half an hour. Right now, the bio on his official account reads \u201Cformer CEO of Dogecoin,\u201D so the position seems to be vacant again. If you\u2019re looking for a new job, maybe think about applying \u2013 but being a tech superhero with multiple groundbreaking projects will probably help more than any college degree.","As of the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at USD 0.003140, having jumped by 24.5% in the past 24 hours with USD 79 million in daily trading volume. DOGE price is also up by almost 60% in the past month.","DOGE price chart:","_____","Still, while this has moved Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey slightly into the background, it can safely be assumed that this is not where Dorsey intends to stay. After all, his endeavors in boosting crypto adoption still speak for themselves. The cryptoverse still loves you, Dorsey. Don\u2019t leave us."],"entity":[{"type":"USD 79 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dogecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Charlie Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elon Musk]","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marshall Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"24.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Community","Dogecoin","Elon Musk"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
