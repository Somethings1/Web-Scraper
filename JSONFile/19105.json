These major players account for about 90% of total trading volume in the spot Bitcoin ETF space, Franklin Templeton believes its product will gain traction, reports Fredrik Vold from Cryptonews.","US Bitcoin Spot ETFs See $2.8 Billion Since Launch","Bitcoin-backed investment options have continued to attract large inflows. Capturing this trend, digital asset management firm CoinShares noted $2.8 billion in inflows since the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, reports Jimmy Aki from Cryptonews.","The Bitcoin spot ETFs are a hybrid financial instrument that allows retail investors to interface with the digital asset ecosystem. Instead of buying Bitcoin directly, investors can purchase tokenized shares in a fund that tracks Bitcoin\u2019s price. Bitcoin ETFs have been gaining popularity largely because investors don\u2019t have to store the virtual assets. Spot ETFs track the underlying asset\u2019s performance in real-time without the user exerting extra effort.","Ethereum Gas Fees Surge ","Ethereum remains the second-largest crypto by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Gas fees on the Ethereum network have soared to levels not seen since March 2023, driven by the growing interest in a new experimental token standard known as ERC-404, reports Hassan Shittu from Cryptonews.","On February 9, Ethereum gas prices soared to an average peak of 70 gwei, equivalent to $60 for a standard transaction. Peak gas costs even reached as high as 377 gwei, a level not seen since May 12, 2023. Several factors have contributed to the heightened gas fees, but the primary catalyst has been the hype surrounding the ERC-404 token standard."],"entity":[{"type":"Cathy Wood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Franklin Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fredrik Vold","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank of New York Mellon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 12, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2.8 Billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$60","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 12, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton Spot Ethereum ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$2.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jimmy Aki","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Franklin Templeton","Securities and Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
