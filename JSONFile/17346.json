He\u2019s quoted as saying that this NFT is \u201Cgoing to be pretty hard to beat,\u201D that it\u2019s \u201Cthe most valuable piece of art for this generation\u201D and is worth a USD 1bn, and that \u201Cthe only thing you can\u2019t hack digitally is time.\u201D","Per the information provided by the announcement on Metapurse, it\u2019s an NFT production studio, as well as the world\u2019s \u201Clargest NFT fund,\u201D financed by MetaKovan and operated jointly with Twobadour. Besides the latest Beeple\u2019s piece, the fund also contains the complete set of the 20 first-edition Beeple Everydays: The 2020 Collection, bought in a December 2020 auction for USD 2.2m. Other pieces include Urbit Galaxy, F1 DeltaTime III, First Supper, and virtual estates in Cryptovoxels and Decentraland (MANA).","Both Metakovan\u2019s Twitter account and the Nifty Gateway marketplace account show his participation in NFT auctions. Savage$77, for example, is MetaKovan\u2019s sold out collection that includes footage from his computer during the December 11 Beeple auction.","However, per independent reporter Amy Castor, MetaKovan may be crypto entrepreneur Vignesh Sundaresan, based on his voice in interviews and provided \u201Corigin stories.\u201D In the recent Good Time Show interview, MetaKovan said he got into crypto in 2013, lived in Canada for a while, and moved to Singapore in 2017 as crypto regulations in North America were \u201Cvery unclear,\u201D which Castor says is Sundaresan\u2019s story as well.","The latter, she said, is the co-founder of Canadian bitcoin (BTC) ATM company BitAccess, as well as founder of Singapore-based Lendroid Foundation, consulting firm Portkey Technologies, and defunct Canadian crypto exchange Coins-e which was accused by some users as being a potential scam.","\u201CThis is about pumping [Metapurse\u2019s token] B20,\u201D claims Castor, \u201Cso holders and Metapurse can benefit when they go to sell the token\u2014i.e., get more ETH, buy more NFTs, rinse, repeat.\u201D","B20\u2019s total supply is 10m, and Metapurse owns 59% of it. At the same time, Beeple owns 2% of all the tokens, which Castor suggested could be a cause for a conflict of interest.","\u201CAt the end of the day, this is a straight-up initial coin offering-style index fund to speculate on NFTs, with a twist: MetaKovan owns most of the tokens\u2014and he has an existing business relationship with the artist,\u201D Castor argued.","Per the author, Sundaresan asked for the post to be taken down as it contains \u201Cseveral factual inaccuracies\u201D but he reportedly did not point them out.","Cryptonews.com contacted Sundaresan and Beeple for comment.","Per CoinGecko, at 14:46 UTC, B20 is trading at almost USD 14, having dropped 12% in a day. Two spikes are obvious this month: March 10 to USD 28.45, and March 13 (post-auction) to USD 26.15. The price is up by 1,594% in a month.","B20 price chart:","As reported, Beeple\u2019s artwork was auctioned at famous British auction house Christie\u2019s, thus becoming the most expensive NFT ever sold, after works by Jeff Koons and David Hockney, thus positioning the author among the top three most valuable living artists. Christie\u2019s is also the first major auction house to offer a unique NFT minted exclusively for it and to accept cryptocurrency for it.","Initially, it seemed that Tron (TRX)\u2018s Justin Sun won the bidding war that had erupted in the last twenty minutes of the auction, but it was soon clarified that he had been outbid at the last minute by MetaKovan. Sun, however, alleged that an error on the Christie\u2019s system had stopped him from submitting a USD 70m bid.","According to Bloomberg, prior to the sale, Christie\u2019s Noah Davis said that \u201Cthere have been a handful of really dogged, really serious clients pursuing it, and they are mostly people who are very steeped in crypto.\u201D","That said, there were some questions over what exactly did all these people bid for. Eric Wall, the Chief Investment Officer of the crypto hedge fund outfit Arcane Assets, for example, asked: \u201CWhat if the bidders in the beeple auction weren\u2019t bidding for the NFT but bidding to win the \u201Cmost expensive NFT auction\u201D.\u201D Others argued that the bidders may have been after both.","___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Hack Sunday: NFT Theft Follows a Personal Token Attack\n\u2013 Second-Hand NFT Market for NBA Top Shot Packs Appears on eBay\n\u2013 Consider These Legal Questions Before Spending Millions on NFTs\n\u2013 NFT Overtakes Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and XRP on Google\n\u2013 Grimes and Paris Hilton Go Full NFT \u2013 But Some Warn of Trouble Ahead\n\u2013 Check These 4 Make-Your-Own-NFT Platforms\n\u2013 Non-Fungible 2021: Prepare Your NFTs For DeFi, Staking, and Sharing"],"entity":[{"type":"Beeple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Hockney","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$77","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Paris","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"December 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Lendroid Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sundaresan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jeff Koons","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Christie\u2019s Noah Davis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vignesh Sundaresan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eric Wall","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Grimes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MetaKovan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Urbit Galaxy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Amy Castor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1,594%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"North America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Portkey Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DeltaTime III","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Metapurse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Justin Sun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Supper","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 13","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Time Show","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NBA Top Shot Packs Appears","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"MetaKovan","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Art","Ethereum","Investing","NFT","Non-fungible tokens"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
