While a plea agreement, which was released in November, gave Zhao the ability to appeal any sentence longer than 18 months, the DOJ asked for 36 in a sentencing memo released last week. The defense asked for house arrest and probation, with no time in prison. The Probation Office recommended five months in its presentence report, according to last week\u2019s defense filing.","By asking for a longer sentence, the DOJ seems to be sending a strong message, said Tama Kudman, a partner with Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner LLP. The DOJ has been trying to tamp down on money laundering via crypto, and Zhao was \u201Cpretty flagrant with anti-money laundering rules.\u201D","Read more: Binance's CZ Will Spend Less Than a Year in Prison, Polymarket Traders Bet","\u201CThe government wants to make sure these low guidelines don\u2019t give anyone comfort to equally feel free to violate our anti-money laundering initiatives,\u201D she said.","And while the longer sentence may have initially taken the crypto industry by surprise, that doesn\u2019t mean the DOJ is reneging on a firm agreement to only recommend up to 18 months, Kudman said.","\u201CGenerally, when we\u2019re negotiating pleas, we\u2019re negotiating things like loss amount and what arguments may be retained by the parties,\u201D she said. \u201CThere\u2019s nothing I see in this document that suggests they were limited to the 18 months.\u201D","This cuts both ways: the DOJ kept the ability to argue for a longer sentence than the guidelines suggested, but this is also how the defense can argue for a much shorter sentence than the guidelines suggested, she said.","The DOJ pointed to the volume of funds that flew through Binance without appropriate know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks in place in its filing.","Zhao\u2019s lawyers have argued \u2013 with support from family and friends \u2013 that he\u2019s repentant, tried to rectify the situation and won\u2019t be a recidivist, so he shouldn\u2019t serve any prison time at all. Instead, they argued that house arrest and probation would meet the needs of justice.","Either way, the decision now rests with the judge, who has broad discretion. He could accept or reject either party\u2019s arguments about the importance of deterrence and what sort of sentence would sufficiently deter potential future crimes by not just Zhao but other members of the crypto community.","Another attorney, who couldn\u2019t comment publicly on the case, agreed that it\u2019s not unusual for prosecutors to ask for a sentence that diverges from the guidelines calculation.","Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is an example of this \u2013 the guidelines calculation for his sentence was over 100 years, but prosecutors asked for 50 instead. A judge sentenced him to 25 years in prison.","\u201CIt also happens when the guidelines are viewed as not punitive. That\u2019s often the case because the BSA guidelines are relatively low and don\u2019t take into account the aggravating factors,\u201D they said, adding they were not surprised that there was \u201Ca flavor of sanctions violation underneath what is formally a BSA charge.\u201D","The biggest example of how Zhao\u2019s hearing may go lies with former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes\u2019 case. Like Zhao, Hayes was charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and pleaded guilty. Hayes received six months of house arrest and two years of probation from the judge overseeing his case.","While Zhao has the ability to appeal a longer sentence, it would be difficult for him to succeed, the second attorney said. Circuit courts rarely reverse a district court-imposed sentence, even if it\u2019s excessive, they said.","\u201CThe parties wanted to be free to recommend whatever they wanted,\u201D Kudman said. \u201CEvery negotiation in every case has its own different flavor with different concerns.\u201D","Nor does she think the DOJ acted in bad faith here. If the DOJ hadn\u2019t disclosed its position during plea negotiations, that would be a sign of bad faith.","But here, the DOJ had very little to lose by asking for a longer sentence, the second attorney said, though other attorneys who might be involved in future plea agreements will certainly be paying attention.","The DOJ\u2019s suggestion that Zhao shouldn\u2019t get credit for taking responsibility may come up.","\u201CIn some sense, the sophisticated white collar lawyers will track this plea agreement, and they\u2019ll use it in future negotiations, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s [strange] to have such a low figure for a defendant who had a long history,\u201D the attorney said. \u201CThat\u2019ll get quoted back to the DOJ.\u201D","Still, Zhao will earn goodwill from the system for coming in, the second attorney said. Part of that is in the plea agreement itself: \u201CThe fact he hasn\u2019t pleaded guilty to sanctions violations is an enormous give to him.\u201D","The DOJ-recommended sentence is also still shorter than if Zhao had gone to trial.","Zhao might also receive credit from the judge for those same actions, as well as for abiding by the terms of his bond release \u2013 even after they were modified.","\u201CThe difference between someone who tries to evade capture and someone who comes in and pleads guilty is night and day, and he\u2019s going to get an enormous amount of credit,\u201D the second attorney said.","Correction (April 29, 2024, 16:35 UTC): Corrects first bullet to note that Zhao cannot appeal a sentence shorter than 18 months.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner LLP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 29, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BSA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arthur Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tama Kudman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kudman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Probation Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Binance","Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao","U.S. Department of Justice"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De"]}
