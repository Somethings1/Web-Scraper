This content will then be uploaded onto a blockchain platform using Numbers Protocol\u2019s suite of tools, specifically Capture Cam and Capture Dashboard.","These tools aim to enhance the credibility of captured digital media by detecting potential manipulation attempts through artificial intelligence.","Beyond professional journalists, Numbers Protocol has invited civil society organizations to contribute by using the Capture application.","The platform automatically associates all user-generated content with provenance data. This embedded data empowers media organizations to verify the authenticity of such content efficiently.","Numbers Protocol co-founder Tammy Yang shed light on the company\u2019s approach to detecting deepfakes and manipulated media. She told Cryptonews that all content submitted by news outlets and photojournalists undergo a blockchain registration process.","This allows users to upload the content to a verification engine powered by an AI model. The model then compares the uploaded content to a database of similar content. If the content originates from a trusted source, the engine will display an exact match.","Conversely, content from unverified sources will be compared against similar content from established sources. This will highlight potential discrepancies and provide users with a means to discern authentic information.","Upon registration, each piece of content receives a unique identifier, or Nid, generated using the ERC-7053 standard. This Nid directly corresponds to the content\u2019s hash. Consequently, any alteration to the original content will result in a different hash and, therefore, a different Nid. Additionally, the verification engine\u2019s AI model can independently verify if uploaded content matches the registered version.","She further said the verification engine will also be available for public use.","\u201CWe are actively working with civil society groups and our own community in India on this project,\u201D she said. \u201CWe believe that citizen reporters are just as important as the established press and equally need to have their content protected and archived.\u201D","To ensure impartiality, Yang emphasized that the selection process for partnering journalists and media organizations is conducted in a strictly unbiased manner.","\u201CNumbers Protocol is a decentralized network and the collaboration opportunity is open to all journalists and media outlets,\u201D she said. \u201CThe value of Numbers Protocol is to present the full picture, showing the provenance (i.e. where the content was coming from, how it was generated) to everyone who wants to know the story behind the content.\u201D","The provenance records created verify the integrity of digital content and can also be used by photojournalists as a mechanism to monetize and license their work."],"entity":[{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tammy Yang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jan. 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"India","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Yang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Numbers Protocol","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Capture Dashboard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"7053","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Election","India"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
