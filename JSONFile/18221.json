Although Biden has already begun putting together his political team ahead of taking power in January next year, Trump is thought to be looking for ways to mount a legal challenge into the ballot-counting process.","That means that Beeple is still reluctant to pull the trigger. Once a winner is finally declared, a chain function will be enacted, changing the artwork forever.","The most likely result \u2013 a confirmed Biden win \u2013 will see them artwork switch to a depiction of Trump\u2019s apparently lifeless, bloated corpse lying face down in a public park, covered in disparaging graffiti as a blue bird lands on his back and tweets a clown emoji.","But should Trump pull off a remarkable turnaround, a very different outcome is in the cards: Enter a muscle-bound, mean-looking Trump, naked but for a crown \u2013 and striding purposefully through a blazing inferno.","A user named Pablo bought the artwork back in October \u2013 and now wants a cool USD 66,666 for it.","Meanwhile, as reported, after a number of complaints, crypto derivatives exchange FTX will allow those who bet on Donald Trump to win the 2020 US presidential election to hold onto their bets for free until February 1, 2021. \u201CIf, by then, Trump has been unambiguously reelected to the presidency, they will pay out [USD] 1,\u201D said the announcement. The exchange added that they have \u201Cgiven in to the trolls,\u201D that they \u201Cregret deeply doing this,\u201D and that they will not make further concessions.\n___\nLearn more:\nThe US Election: Pullback Possible, But Neither Trump Nor Biden Won\u2019t Stop Bitcoin\nKnife-edge Biden-Trump Showdown Has Crypto Backers on Both Sides"],"entity":[{"type":"Trump","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Beeple","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Beeple","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Trump Showdown Has Crypto Backers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 1, 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Joe Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Biden","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Art","Blockchain","Non-fungible tokens"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
