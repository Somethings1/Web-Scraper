During the raid, investigators seized 61,000 Bitcoins, worth $1.7 billion at the time.","Under pressure to explain the damning situation, Wen initially claimed that Bitcoin was mined.","She eventually changed her story, stating it was a \u201Clove present\u201D from Qian, who fled the country after the raid.","Jian Wen was ultimately put on trial for assisting Qian in converting Bitcoin into cash, jewellery, and property.","While Wen denied all charges, Southwark Crown Court convicted her guilty of three counts of money laundering on March 20th.","Following the conviction, a group representing the scam victims set out to reclaim the Bitcoin purchased with their money, now worth $4.3 billion.","The group reportedly submitted a letter to China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to negotiate with the UK government for the return of the \u201Chuge amount\u201D of seized Bitcoin. ","They also contacted China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, claiming to have the backing of almost 2,500 signatures from the victims, and want to submit them to both ministries.","The letter requests that the Chinese government and the UK judicial departments work together to submit evidence proving their status as \u201Clegitimate owners.\u201D The group said:","\u201CWe do not want, and will never accept, a situation where Bitcoins are confiscated by the UK and not returned to us.\u201D","At the time of writing, the UK government had not issued a statement on how it intends to deal with the Bitcoin it holds, and Qian is still at large.","However, if the UK government evaluates that no one else was entitled to the asset, it would typically be divided and distributed to the police and Home Office.","However, the victims who \u201Csuffered extremely serious economic losses, resulting in family breakdown, separation from their children, indebtedness, and no money for medical treatment,\u201D have not gone without aid.","Four victims who lost money in the scam claim that, since last May, victims who enrolled with Chinese police have received two pay-outs from a task group on the fraud, headed by Tianjin authorities.","They stated that 8% and 5% of their investment capital had been returned with assets recovered from Lantian Gerui and its former employees. ","Additionally, a local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country\u2019s largest lender, has committed to assisting with the return process and has estimated that 207,000 people invested in the fraudulent scheme."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 20th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$6.2 Billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"last May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tianjin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Zhimin Qian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$30 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lantian Gerui","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Home Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Southwark Crown Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jian Wen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","China","UK"],"authors":["Harvey Hunter"]}
