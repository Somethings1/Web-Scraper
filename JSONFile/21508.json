It initially operated only as a derivatives exchange for institutions and later added spot crypto trading for retail.","Fireblock uses cryptographic key sharing technology, Multi-Party Computation (MPC), to remove a single point of compromise from API credentials, combined with secure hardware enclaves to prevent further threats or inside collusion attacks.","Customers can use Fireblocks\u2019 policy engine to configure user roles, governance policies, and approval workflows for exchange deposit and withdrawal operations to protect against an insider unilaterally moving funds from an exchange account. They can also deposit, withdraw, and rebalance across the Fireblocks Console or API and monitor all connected account balances, according to a press statement.","\u201CAs we continue to expand our offerings for institutional and retail clients, this collaboration underscores our commitment to providing a robust and reliable trading infrastructure for our global clientele,\u201D said Usman Naeem, CEO of Coinbase International Exchange, in a statement."],"entity":[{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fireblocks\u2019 governance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fireblocks","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fireblocks\u2019","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bermuda Monetary Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MPC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase International Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Usman Naeem","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Fireblocks"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
