Brian Timmons, partner at Los Angeles-based law firm Quinn Emanuel, which is representing BitGo in this case.","BitGo filed suit against Galaxy in August 2022, seeking $100 million in damages and alleging that Galaxy \u201Cintentionally\u201D breached its May 2021 merger agreement when it could no longer afford the $1.2 billion price tag after experiencing massive financial losses during the crypto bear market. Galaxy blamed the breakup on BitGo\u2019s failure to provide certain audited financial statements on time and said BitGo\u2019s claims were \u201Cwithout merit.\u201D","Last June, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor J.
