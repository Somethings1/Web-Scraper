This pattern suggests that Bitcoin could break out in either direction. On the lower side, a break below $61,764 could lead the price towards $60,185, with further declines potentially reaching $58,800 and $56,640.","Conversely, if Bitcoin breaks above $63,000, it could target resistance levels at $65,500 and $67,250. The outlook remains cautiously bullish above $61,765, but a break below this level could trigger significant selling pressure.","The Mega Dice presale is nearing its completion, having successfully raised $960,233.61 with over 13.91 million $DICE tokens sold out of an available 14.7 million.
