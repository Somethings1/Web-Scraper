Earlier this year, it received an investment boost of USD 3.6 million from Daehong Communications, a marketing affiliate of retail conglomerate Lotte Group. Some estimate the company\u2019s corporate worth may be as high as $64.5 million.","Blocko is set to work on a number of non-fungible token (NFT) and security token offering (STO)-related products with a number of Lotte Group affiliates, the startup\u2019s CEO Kim Jong-hwan stated.","Another conglomerate backer is CJ, whose IT services arm CJ OliveNetworks last year enlisted Blocko to develop an NFT-based ticketing solution that will be able to fight counterfeiting. CJ has also spoken about its plans to use NFT technology throughout \u201Cthe entertainment business in the future.\u201DÂ ","South Korea\u2019s crypto sector has grown exponentially in the past few years, and prior to the start of crypto winter, few industries in the nation were raking in profits on the same scale.","The country\u2019s two biggest crypto exchanges \u2013 Upbit and Bithumb \u2013 have both attracted considerable interest in the financial markets, with multiple financial analysts claiming that Upbit in particular may be mulling a Nasdaq listing.","Upbit has been classified as a \u201Cvery large\u201D company (on the same kind of footing as the likes of Samsung and LG) by the South Korean markets regulator. As such, most agree that the firm is simply too large for an IPO on the KOSDAQ.","Other, smaller crypto exchanges have also been touted as possible candidates for a KOSDAQ IPO. But since the start of crypto winter, talk of plans like these have cooled quickly \u2013 with most crypto players posting poor quarterly results.","Founded in 2014, Blocko is one of South Korea\u2019s so-called \u201Cfirst-generation\u201D blockchain companies. The company posted net profits of just under USD 500 million in net profit last year, along with USD 1.6 billion in sales."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Shinhan Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lotte Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"STO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shinhan Financial Investment","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD 1.6 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Blocko","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"POSCO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$64.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Blocko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Samsung","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"winter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kim Jong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Daehong Communications","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"LG","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["IPO"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
