Rollups will have the capability to incorporate \u201Cblobs\u201D of data on a beacon node under EIP-4844.","\u201CThe data in these blobs is not accessible to the EVM and is automatically deleted after a fixed time period (1-3 months),\u201D a post on the Ethereum Organization\u2019s website noted. \u201CThis means rollups can send their data much more cheaply and pass the savings on to end users in the form of cheaper transactions.\u201D","The name Dencun is derived from a fusion of star and Devcon city names, according to the Ethereum Foundation. Dencun is a blend of Deneb, representing a star, and the location of Devcon 3, which is Cancun.\n","Crypto asset manager Grayscale noted in a blog post last week that the Dencun upgrade is one of several factors contributing to Ethereum entering its maturation phase, noting that the upgrade would help make Ethereum a \u201Cmore scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform.\u201D","\u201CDespite increasing conflict with competitors, Ethereum faces a number of tailwinds, including network effects and billions in network revenue, the Dencun upgrade, a flourishing Layer 2 ecosystem, and increasing use cases for its security budget,\u201D Grayscale said. \u201CMoreover, the potential for a spot Ethereum ETF could bring ETH the asset further into the awareness of both institutions and the broader public.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"4844","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 27","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cancun","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 27, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"8:55","content":"TIME"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 13","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Christine Kim","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum Organization","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Devcon 3","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dencun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Deneb","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Devcon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Dencun","Ethereum"],"authors":["Brian Yue"]}
