With an initial investment of $220m, its Bitcoin holdings have surged 160% to hit $573m by the end of Q1 in 2024.","\u201CWe believe the world needs an open protocol for money, one that\u2019s not owned or controlled by any single entity,\u201D CEO Dorsey company said in a letter to shareholders. He added that \u201Cbitcoin is the best and only candidate to be that protocol, and to ultimately become the native currency of the internet.\u201D","Block currently allocates less than 3% of its resources to Bitcoin projects, Dorsey said.","In the first quarter, the payments firm\u2019s gross profit grew 22% year-over-year to $2.09b. Net income quadrupled to $472m, or 74 cents per share, compared to $98.3m or 16 cents per share in the same quarter last year.","Meanwhile, Block raised its adjusted EBITDA forecast for the second quarter to $690m from $670m. The company also raised its annual adjusted core earnings guidance to at least $2.76b. This is up from its previous forecast of $2.63b.","These strong results and optimistic outlook sent the stock price 5% higher to close at $70.30 on Thursday.","Block\u2019s mobile payment platform, Cash App, continued to be a profit powerhouse. The unit generated $1.26b in gross profit, a 25% increase year-over-year.","However, the company faces a potential regulatory hurdle. Currently,Â federal prosecutors are investigating alleged compliance issues at Square and Cash App.","These concerns reportedly center on Block potentially failing to collect adequate customer information. The investigation is also looking at transactions from sanctioned countries and enabling crypto transactions for terrorist groups.","A former employee has claimed that thousands of transactions went unreported, suggesting a significant challenge for Block in the coming months.","Block recently ramped up its Bitcoin mining efforts. It is transitioning from designing individual chips to developing a complete mining system.","The company finalized the design of a cutting-edge 3 nanometer Bitcoin mining chip and is now partnering with a major semiconductor foundry to bring it to life."],"entity":[{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$98.3m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"22%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$2.63","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Cash App","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.26","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$2.76","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"160%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"second quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$70.30","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cash App","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"74 cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$690m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$670m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$472m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$573m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$220m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"16 cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.09","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Block","Jack Dorsey"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
