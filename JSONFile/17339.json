WisdomTree, Invesco, and Fidelity also made similar applications. ","BTC currently has a market dominance of 51.23% after it reclaimed its 50% market dominance for the first time in two years. ","Despite skepticism creeping in following the SEC\u2019s rejection of past spot BTC ETF applications, some observers including analysts at brokerage firm Bernstein opine that the Commission is likely to approve the proposal. ","\u201CSEC would rather bring in a regulated bitcoin ETF led by more mainstream Wall Street participants and with surveillance from existing regulated exchanges, than having to deal with a Grayscale OTC product filling the institutional gap.\u201D ","Bitcoin\u2019s fear and greed index remains bullish and maintains its stance in the greed zone at 64.","Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 64 \u2014 Greed\nCurrent price: $31,158 pic.twitter.com\/Tl8vVQp9GA",""],"entity":[{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"98%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bernstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$6.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"51.23%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Grayscale OTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$310 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$31,158","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cardano (ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"James Butterfill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$123 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CoinShares Head of Market Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$31,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"25.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","CoinShares","ETF"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
