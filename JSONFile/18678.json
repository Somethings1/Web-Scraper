Brunet claims to have screenshots of Eisenberg engaging in disturbing conversations about children.","The emergence of these charges marks a significant development in Eisenberg\u2019s legal troubles, which already included the conviction for fraud and market manipulation. ","The severity of the allegations surrounding child pornography further compounds the seriousness of the case.","As reported, Eisenberg has been found guilty in a Manhattan federal court for orchestrating a scheme that resulted in the theft of approximately $110 million from the Solana-based DeFi platform.","Prosecutors argued that Eisenberg orchestrated a complex exploit on the platform, leading to substantial financial losses. ","Eisenberg, who has been in custody since January 2023, could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.","On October 11, 2022, Mango Markets was the victim of an attack in which approximately $110 million was drained from its treasury. ","Shortly after the attack, Avraham Eisenberg came forward as the perpetrator, asserting that the exploit was merely a \u201Chighly profitable trading strategy\u201D and claiming it was conducted within the bounds of legality and the protocol\u2019s intended design.","According to prosecutors, Eisenberg utilized two accounts to engage in manipulative trading involving futures contracts tied to the values of Mango\u2019s token MNGO and the stablecoin USD Coin.","These trades purportedly inflated the value of his contracts by 1,300% within 20 minutes, allowing him to borrow against his holdings and withdraw $110 million in various cryptocurrencies.","Subsequently, Eisenberg agreed to return $67 million in exchange for other token holders refraining from pursuing legal action or freezing his assets.","He was arrested on December 26, 2022, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he resided, and has remained in custody since then, deemed a flight risk by prosecutors.","On January 9, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) supplemented the FBI\u2019s charges, levying two counts of market manipulation against Eisenberg.","A lawsuit filed by Mango Labs characterized Eisenberg as a \u201Cnotorious online personality\u201D with a history of attacking multiple cryptocurrency platforms and manipulating cryptocurrency markets."," "],"entity":[{"type":"December 26, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1,300%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 3","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October 11, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$67 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Eisenberg","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"San Juan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Avraham Eisenberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Puerto Rico","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mango Markets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eisenberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Christopher Brunet","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Manhattan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mango Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$110 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["crypto scam","Mango Market"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
