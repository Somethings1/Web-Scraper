He has done a lot of things for the industry.\u201D","However, Teng\u2019s leadership style seems to be the opposite of Zhao\u2019s. In the interview, he made constant references to the staff that assists in maintaining the company and his experience in the regulatory sector, signaling that \u201Cthe narrative will not be the same,\u201D the report said.","\u201CThe landscape has changed drastically, but users trust us,\u201D Teng told EL PAÍS, referencing a string of incidents hitting the sector. One of the latest was Binance\u2019s own battle with regulators globally and in the US.","\u201CWe made mistakes. In terms of compliance, control in those early days [2017] was still inadequate in some areas. As part of the resolution, we acknowledge those mistakes, and we are moving past them,\u201D Teng said.","He made sure to distance Binance from cases like FTX or LUNA, saying that the US regulators found no instances of fraud in the use of Binance\u2019s clients\u2019 assets. Also, users were able to withdraw their investments from the platform at any time.","\u201CFor the first few days, there was a net outflow of funds from the Binance platform. However, that has changed: we have seen very robust inflows, and our user base continues to grow,\u201D he added.","One thing that Teng shares with Zhao is that he will not reveal the location of Binance\u2019s global headquarters. \u201CWe have already announced our regional headquarters. France is our regional headquarters for Europe. Dubai is our regional headquarters for the Middle East-North Africa region. When we are ready to make that announcement, we will do so. But we are a global company. We do global deployment,\u201D he stated.","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hopefuls have filed updates to their applications, revealing the details of how the ETFs would function.","Fortune reported that, in updated filings from December 29, two of the issuers released details on the fees that they will charge investors for the ETF.","Invesco\/Galaxy announced that it would waive fees for its first six months of operation and for the first $5 billion in assets held. It will follow this with a 0.59% fee.","Fidelity revealed its fee would be 0.39%.","Also, Fidelity, Galaxy\/Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and BlackRock all listed the first authorized participants that they will work with, Fortune said.","Fidelity and WisdomTree named trading firm Jane Street Capital. BlackRock and Galaxy\/Invesco, both named JP Morgan and Virtu, a market-making firm. Valkyrie named Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald.","US Bitcoin mining company CleanSpark plans to launch an in-house trading desk in 2024 to maximize returns from its holdings of this crypto, Bloomberg reported.","Zachary Bradford, chief executive officer of CleanSpark, said that \u201Cwe really think that doing it ourselves is the best way especially with the large Bitcoin balance we have. It just makes financial sense to do it in-house.\u201D","Bradford further opined that other miners will likely start having trading desks in-house. \u201CThat way, you can manage it with your own risk profiles and expertise and keep a really close eye on it.\u201D","CleanSpark plans to make strategies based on regulated crypto offerings such as the option contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or its affiliates, the report said.","\u201CWe may have to move a small amount into different accounts but we will keep the cold storage custody with holders like Coinbase with segregated accounts,\u201D Bradford stated."],"entity":[{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Zachary Bradford","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"France","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Galaxy\/Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jane Street","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Invesco\/Galaxy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"LUNA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chicago Mercantile Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Richard Teng","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"JP Morgan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.59%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"North Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cantor Fitzgerald","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CleanSpark","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"EL PAÍS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Valkyrie","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"December 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jane Street Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bradford","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fortune","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Bitcoin ETF","CleanSpark"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
