Last year\u2019s Wasabi 2.0 upgrade had introduced a more automated version of coin control called \u201Cprivacy control\u201D \u2013 much to the chagrin of Wasabi\u2019s power users.","The bitcoin blockchain uses an unspent transaction output (UTXO) model where funds in a bitcoin address from prior transactions are considered unspent outputs. Those outputs can often be tied to a user\u2019s identity thanks to know-your-customer (KYC) procedures at regulated entities such as centralized exchanges. From a privacy standpoint, these KYC\u2019d coins are sometimes seen as compromised.","Coin control allows users to spot and separate the compromised outputs from more private ones, without the constraints of a fancy algorithm. The more private outputs can then be used for future transactions, lowering the chances of getting doxxed.","\u201CCoin control is an essential privacy feature,\u201D wrote one power user \u2013 openoms \u2013 on Wasabi\u2019s github discussion board. \u201CTaking it away and keeping users in the dark (behind a 'black box' algo) is counter-productive.\u201D","Today\u2019s announcement is part of Wasabi\u2019s 2.0.3 release. Wasabi\u2019s default settings will continue to automatically select which outputs to send for less-technical users.","\u201CYou asked, we listened,\u201D zkSNACKs stated in a release provided to CoinDesk.","\u201CWe have an optional place to put the complexity, where skilled users can fine tune their wallet\u2019s performance to their heart\u2019s desire,\u201D Max Hillebrand, CEO at zkSNACKs, said in the release.","Read more: Chinese 'Spies' Used Wasabi Wallet to Try to Conceal Bitcoin Bribes, Elliptic Says"],"entity":[{"type":"Max Hillebrand","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Privacy","Wasabi Wallet","bitcoin wallet"],"authors":["Frederick Munawa"]}
