It can be traded as a commodity (like oil), but it is also essential to the technological development of applications built on Ethereum \u2013 including applications that have clear, non-financial utility for vital sectors like healthcare, energy, transport, media, agriculture, and beyond.\u201D, the post read. \u201CThe SEC\u2019s approach would make it impossible for developers to innovate and build, because it would classify non-financial platforms as financial applications thus requiring the SEC\u2019s oversight and approval.\u201D","This latest lawsuit by Consensys mirrors a recent Coinbase filing.  In March, it emerged that Coinbase had filed a lawsuit against the SEC, seeking a court directive for the regulatory authority to establish clear guidelines for the cryptocurrency sector.","In the lawsuit detailed in their March 11 court submission, Coinbase challenged the SEC\u2019s lack of formal rulemaking for the crypto sector, asserting that the agency\u2019s actions hindered the industry\u2019s development and clarity.","The filing criticized the SEC for its passive stance on crypto regulation, arguing that the absence of specific rules has left the sector navigating a regulatory grey area.","Most recently, SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda have publicly criticized the agency\u2019s unclear cryptocurrency enforcement policies following a recent settlement with ShapeShift."],"entity":[{"type":"April 25, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Consensys","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Joseph Lubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ShapeShift","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 25","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mark Uyeda","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Joe Lubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["ConsenSys","Lawsuit","Securities Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
