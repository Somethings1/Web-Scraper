The latter is a tech investor. And the former is the CEO of a copywriting firm named SalesFolk and a writer for publications including Inc. and Forbes \u2013 as well as a musician who goes by the moniker Razzlekhan (here she is apparently professing her love to her husband in musical form).","\nIn the Attorney\u2019s document, lawyers explained how law enforcement officials traced funds to a crypto wallet under Lichtenstein\u2019s name. Officers stated they had seized USD 3.6bn worth of tokens \u2013 making for the biggest financial seizure in American history.","They also stated they had found accounts linked to the funds that were controlled by both Morgan and her husband. And there were yet more unusual findings at the couple\u2019s apartment on Wall Street, Manhattan.","The officers\u2019 strange search began thusly, per the document:","\u201CAgents permitted Morgan to retrieve the defendants\u2019 cat, which was hiding under the bed. While Morgan was crouched next to the bed calling to the cat, she positioned herself next to the nightstand, which was still holding one of her phones. She then reached up and grabbed her cell phone from the nightstand and repeatedly hit the lock button. It appeared that Morgan was attempting to lock the phone in a way that would make it more difficult for law enforcement to search the phone\u2019s contents.\u201D","The police then were forced \u201Cto wrest the phone from her hands.\u201D","Under the bed, however, officers found \u201Ca bin containing various bags holding multiple cell phones, SIM cards and assorted electronics\u201D \u2013 as well as a bag labeled \u201CBurner Phone.\u201D","They then went on to find over USD 40,000 worth of cash and \u201Cwhat appears to be a substantial amount of foreign currency.\u201D","The law enforcement found other items including a bag full of mobile phones, multiple hardware wallets and hollowed-out books."," ","The duo had applied for bail, claiming in their own filing that Morgan had previously suffered from MERS-related lung damage, so would be placed in danger should she be jailed \u2013 where the risk of COVID-19 infection would be high. They added that she had also recently undergone surgery and that the government\u2019s \u201Ccomplaint is especially flimsy as to Ms. Morgan.\u201D","As evidence that they posed no flight risk, their lawyers explained:","\u201C[Morgan and Lichtenstein] previously froze several of her embryos at a hospital in New York in anticipation of starting a family together, as she can only conceive through in vitro fertilization because she suffers from endometriosis. The couple would never flee from the country at the risk of losing access to their ability to have children, which they were discussing having this year until their lives were disrupted by their arrests in this case.\u201D","But the FBI appears to have refuted these claims, noting that a \u201Creview of Lichtenstein and Morgan\u2019s devices\u201D was \u201Congoing, and adding that officers expected to uncover \u201Cadditional wallets\u201D within \u201Cencrypted partitions and other secured folders.\u201D\n\nFurthermore, officers said they found Lichtenstein\u2019s Russian passport (he has dual nationality as his family is from Russia), noting:","\u201CRussia does not extradite its own citizens. If Lichtenstein succeeded in fleeing to Russia, he could escape prosecution in the United States indefinitely. Morgan\u2019s marriage to Lichtenstein would allow her to qualify for Russian citizenship.\u201D ","Additionally, the officers reported that when the couple was arrested, \u201Cthey had a brief conversation with each other in Russian.\u201D","And the FBI claimed that just because they had not attempted to flee the country when officers first began moving against them earlier this month was not proof they would not seek to leave the country if released on bail, noting that \u201Ctheir failure to [escape when they had the chance] is not indicative of their future risk of flight.\u201D","While many media outlets have focused on the duo\u2019s somewhat unorthodox lifestyle and behavior, others claimed they\u2019re clearly cut from a different cloth from the average criminal.","Eric Wall, the CIO of Arcane Assets, claimed that Morgan\u2019s musical activities were likely signs of her \u201Cintelligence.\u201D","Wall\u2019s observations may well be true, but some may feel that even this doesn\u2019t make any of these musical monstrosities any more listenable.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Bitfinex Hack: Meet the Self-Proclaimed \u2018Serial Entrepreneur\u2019 Couple Charged Over Laundering Bitcoin\n\u2013 US Government Is Now Top Bitcoin Whale.
