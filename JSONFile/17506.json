Kaplan ruled in Manhattan federal courthouse Thursday morning.","Kaplan likened Bankman-Fried\u2019s theft of nearly $8 billion in customer funds to \u201Ca game,\u201D where he weighed \u201Cthe cost of getting caught discounted by probability or improbability, against the gain of getting away without getting caught, given the probabilities.\u201D","\u201CThat was his game,\u201D Kaplan said. \u201C It started at least as early as Jane Street and it continued to the very end. It\u2019s his nature.\u201D","Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven fraud charges in November 2023 after a whirlwind trial that saw the FTX founder testify in his own defense.","In Thursday morning\u2019s ruling, Kaplan called Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense \u201Cmisleading, logically flawed, and speculative,\u201D saying he had never seen a \u201Cperformance\u201D like his testimony throughout his entire career.","\u201CTo put it in more colloquial terms, a thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets the stolen money is not entitled to a discount on the sentence by using his Las Vegas winnings to pay back all or part of what he stole when if or when he gets caught,\u201D Kaplan continued.","\u201CHe knew it was wrong,\u201D Kaplan continued. \u201CHe knew it was criminal. He regrets making a bad bet against the likelihood of getting caught \u2013 and he\u2019s not going to admit a thing.\u201D","A visibly thinner Bankman-Fried was escorted into the courtroom by two security guards in a beige jumpsuit, his hair still in its signature curly mop.","\u201CI know a lot of people feel really let down, and they were right, they were, were very let down,\u201D Bankman-Fried told the court. \u201CI\u2019m sorry about that. I\u2019m sorry about what happened at every stage, things I should have done and said, and things I shouldn\u2019t have. I failed everyone I care about and everything I care about too.\u201D","He went on to apologize to his FTX colleagues, his brother Gabe, and those impacted by the exchange\u2019s collapse, claiming that it \u201Chaunts\u201D him every day and causes him \u201Cexcruciating guilt.\u201D","However, he doubled down on his claim that the exchange \u201Calways\u201D had enough assets to cover its losses.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s new lawyer, Marc Mukasey, largely tried to deflect from his client\u2019s image as a \u201Cmonster\u201D to that of a seemingly awkward math nerd who was well-meaning but ultimately flawed.","\u201CSBF doesn\u2019t make decisions with malice in his heart,\u201D Mukasey said. \u201CHe makes decisions with math in his head.\u201D","Does anybody know which politicians haven't returned the fraudulent donations received from Sam Bankman Fried? #SBF","\u2014 Carol Roth (@caroljsroth) March 28, 2024","","This logic came back to hurt his client when Kaplan claimed that the same cost-benefit mindset presented \u201Ca not trivial risk\u201D for the crypto fraudster to execute another scheme.","He further claimed Bankman-Fried\u2019s push for crypto regulation during his time as FTX\u2019s CEO was \u201Call an act,\u201D claiming the fraudster wanted \u201Cto be a hugely, hugely politically influential figure in this country.\u201D","Bankman-Fried was facing a total maximum penalty of 110 years in prison, with prosecutors pushing for upwards of 40 years for the former \u201Cking of crypto.\u201D","Meanwhile, the defense requested a maximum penalty of six years in prison for their client.","Kaplan has ordered Bankman-Fried to be placed in a medium-security prison, potentially back in his home state of California. He is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY."," "],"entity":[{"type":"Marc Mukasey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Las Vegas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mukasey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jane Street","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$11.02 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gabe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Metropolitan Detention Center","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lewis A.
