(It is conceivable the document represents just part of Alameda.)","That balance sheet is full of FTX \u2013 specifically, the FTT token issued by the exchange that grants holders a discount on trading fees on its marketplace. While there is nothing per se untoward or wrong about that, it shows Bankman-Fried\u2019s trading giant Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. The situation adds to evidence that the ties between FTX and Alameda are unusually close.","Read the latest: Binance Is Strongly Leaning Toward Scrapping FTX Rescue Takeover After First Glance at Books: Source","The financials make concrete what industry-watchers already suspect: Alameda is big.

Its single biggest asset: $3.66 billion of \u201Cunlocked FTT.\u201D The third-largest entry on the assets side of the accounting ledger? A $2.16 billion pile of \u201CFTT collateral.\u201D","There are more FTX tokens among its $8 billion of liabilities: $292 million of \u201Clocked FTT.\u201D (The liabilities are dominated by $7.4 billion of loans.)","\u201CIt\u2019s fascinating to see that the majority of the net equity in the Alameda business is actually FTX\u2019s own centrally controlled and printed-out-of-thin-air token,\u201D said Cory Klippsten, CEO of investment platform Swan Bitcoin, who is known for his critical views of altcoins, which refer to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC).","Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison declined to comment. FTX didn't respond to a request for comment.","Other significant assets on the balance sheet include $3.37 billion of \u201Ccrypto held\u201D and large amounts of the Solana blockchain\u2019s native token: $292 million of \u201Cunlocked SOL,\u201D $863 million of \u201Clocked SOL\u201D and $41 million of \u201CSOL collateral.\u201D Bankman-Fried was an early investor in Solana.
