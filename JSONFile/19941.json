In consideration for any staking activity in which the Fund may engage, the Fund would receive certain network rewards of ether tokens, which may be treated as income to the Fund as compensation for services provided.\u201D \u2013 Fidelity\u2019s 19b-4 form to the SEC.","Chanchal Samadder, head of product at ETC Group, told Cryptonews earlier this month that a primary attraction of ETH for institutional investors lies in its staking yield. For many investors, staking is a way of earning rewards by simply holding Ethereum.\u201CWe anticipate that staked ETH ETFs will face delays in approval in the US, unlike Europe where these products are readily accessible to investors,\u201D adds Samadder.","In February, investment firm Franklin Templeton was the latest asset manager to file a spot Ethereum ETF application with the SEC \u2014 joining \u200B\u200Ba long list of asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Invesco and Galaxy, as well as Cathy Wood\u2019s Ark Invests and 21Shares, all of which have submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF.","Earlier this month,the SEC delayed a decision to approve the BlackRock spot Ethereum ETF.

One of the eleven Bitcoin spot ETFs approved is the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust trading under the ticker symbol \u201CIBIT.\u201D BlackRock\u2019s ETF is leading the pack and so far has attracted $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) in just under two months since launching."],"entity":[{"type":"Cathy Wood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"McNeil","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ETC Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cryptonews","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hector McNeil","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 23","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum ETF","Fidelity","US SEC"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
