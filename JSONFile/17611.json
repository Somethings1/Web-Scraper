Unless the incumbent governor, Democrat Kathy Hochul, vetoes the bill, its provisions will go into force.","The bill states that the \u201Ccontinued and expanded operation of cryptocurrency mining operations running proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions will greatly increase the amount of energy usage in the state of New York, and impact compliance with the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.\u201D ","End\/ We still haven\u2019t heard an answer.\n\nOur focus now turns to @GovKathyHochul who should veto this misguided bill. We encourage all pro-tech NYers to make their voices heard and ask the governor to veto.","Meanwhile, Greenidge Generation Holdings, a vertically integrated crypto data center and power generation company, said that \u201Cshould the legislation be signed into law, our fully permitted power generation and cryptocurrency data center in Dresden, NY will continue to operate without interruption.\u201D","On the other hand, Kenya\u2019s energy production company KenGen has adopted a different approach to crypto, declaring its plans to offer BTC mining companies the KenGen\u2019s surplus geothermal power. This is designed to help industry players meet their energy needs, Quartz reports.","The energy business says that, by offering clean energy, it will contribute to cutting crypto mining\u2019s carbon emissions triggered by bitcoin mining. ","As Africa\u2019s leading geothermal energy producer, Kenya has an installed capacity of 863 MW, the majority of which is ensured by KenGen. The state has an estimated geothermal potential of some 10,000 MW located along the Rift Valley circuit which could be used to foster green crypto mining by local industry players.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Another Bitcoin Mining Scrutiny\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Can be a Force for Good or Bad, Banning it Doesn\u2019t Solve Anything \u2013 FTX.US President\n\n\u2013 Kenyan Crypto Entrepreneurs Urge CMA to Create Regulatory Framework, Not Demons\n\u2013 Bitcoin in Kenya w\/ Roselyne Wanjiru\n\n\u2013 Crypto\u2019s Need for Sustainability Standard-Setting Starts Here\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Efficiency Up 63% in Year, \u2018Sustainable Electricity Mix\u2019 Jumped 59% \u2013 Bitcoin Mining Council\n\n\u2013 After Mozilla Abandoned PoW Cryptos Citing Energy Concerns, Wikipedia May Follow\n\u2013 The Compromises and Benefits of Ethereum Switching to a Proof-of-Stake Network\n__\n(Updated at 13:09 UTC with a statement by the Blockchain Association.
