Based on the company\u2019s BTC holdings per share, Kerrisdale said this would imply a current Bitcoin price of $177,000 per coin \u2013 a spot price two and a half times higher than where it trades today.","GM.

(1\/6)","\u2014 Kerrisdale Capital (@KerrisdaleCap) March 28, 2024","","Since MicroStrategy\u2019s balance sheet is almost entirely comprised of Bitcoin (BTC), investors have often valued the firm like it were a Bitcoin spot ETF. The company\u2019s executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has called the firm a Bitcoin ETF with perks including moderate leverage and no management fees.","Starting in January, the company faced an influx of competition from several asset managers that launched the United States\u2019 first actual Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT, has already accumulated more Bitcoin than MicroStrategy.","\u201CThe days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to Bitcoin are long over,\u201D wrote Kerrisdale.","Any advantages the firm has over regular ETFs \u2013 such as diluting shares to acquire more BTC \u2013 are outweighed by the sheer size of the premium.","\u201CAssuming the current premium of 2.6x contracts to a more historically consistent 1.3x represents 50% downside in MSTR relative to bitcoin,\u201D the firm said.","Shortly after Kerrisdale\u2019s report was published, MSTR shares plummeted by 8% on the day to $1,761.
