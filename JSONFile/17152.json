Here\u2019s why it matters:","Hermés, designer of the legendary Birkin bag, has been caught up in a contentious legal battle that very well may shape how trademarks are applied to digital assets in the Metaverse and beyond.","The luxury goods company formally sued artist Mason Rothschild (real name Sonny Estival) for his creation of \u201CMetaBirkins\u201D \u2013 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) depicting Birkin bags that Rothschild was able to sell for tens of thousands of dollars.","\u201CAs the Chamber of Digital Commerce stands with Hermès in this case, we are not just advocating for one brand\u2019s rights,\u201D read an amicus curiae brief from the trade association. \u201CWe are setting a precedent for the entire digital economy, ensuring that the trademarks which have become synonymous with trust and quality in the physical world carry the same weight in the digital one.\u201D","Hermès was handed a win last week when a federal jury in Manhattan found Rothschild guilty of cybersquatting, brand dilution, and violating the fashion house\u2019s \u201CBirkin\u201D trademark. The ruling will require Rothschild to pay the company $133,000 as well as $23,000 for damages caused by cybersquatting.","A statement in response to: Hermès International, et al. v. Mason Rothschild. pic.twitter.com\/pil6brfGTl","\u2014 MetaBirkins (@MetaBirkins) January 17, 2022","","Rothschild has vowed to fight the verdict, however, with his lead counsel Rhett Millsap stating \u201Cthis is not the end of this case.\u201D","\u201CI am not creating or selling fake Birkin bags,\u201D Rothschild said in a statement. \u201CI\u2019ve made artworks that depict imaginary, fur-covered Birkin bags.\u201D","Rothschild had originally argued that his work was mere artistry in the tradition of portraying branded images, likening MetaBirkins to Andy Warhol\u2019s celebrated Campbell\u2019s soup cans.","The recent brief from the CDC retorts this argument, claiming that \u201CAndy Warhol was not selling soup at a grocery store.\u201D","The brief goes on to compare Hermès\u2019 right to sell its own digital goods as comparable to NFTs by other brands, such as Tiffany & Co. or the Chicago Bulls. Additionally, the trade association argued that Hermès\u2019 already established brand identity gave MetaBirkins its value.","\u201CIt is the identifying features attached to otherwise nameless and faceless lines of computer code which allow those digital goods to be bought and sold online in similar ways to how physical goods are bought and sold online,\u201D the brief stated. \u201CThe fact that a company offers its goods in a digital space should not result in those products or that company receiving any less trademark protection than physical goods sold in the real world.\u201D","As of the time of publication, it is currently unclear whether or not an appeal has been filed."],"entity":[{"type":"tens of thousands of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Chamber of Digital Commerce","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"v.
