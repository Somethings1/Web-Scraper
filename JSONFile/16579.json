The company is said to be gearing up for a second round of competition by \"incorporating the solutions from this first round,\" as highlighted in a press release.","\"If we don't do a great job of optimizing performance ... there are likely to be sudden jumps in performance of the best VDF that anyone has out there post-launch, which could result in significant network instability,\" Bram Cohen, Chia's co-founder, told CoinDesk.","Outside of Chia, there are a total of 11 other blockchain companies exploring VDF technology \u2013 each with unique plans of their own.","As Revealed to CoinDesk in interview, the ethereum sidechain POA Network plans to host \"a public bounty\" for a VDF implementation using the ethereum open-source collaboration platform Gitcoin.","Other than Chia and POA Network, some of the notable crypto projects researching VDF include file storage system Filecoin, smart contract platform Tezos, decentralized app network NEAR protocol and ThunderCore.","The imperative for increased collaboration between all these companies, according to Drake, is all the more needed given that VDFs are \u201Clike a fundamental new primitive.\u201D","\u201CIt\u2019s quite generic in that sense \u2026 It would be nice if the industry standardizes around a single VDF, partly because that would make the various blockchain projects more compatible with each other but it also means that we [wouldn\u2019t] have to reinvent the wheel and [would collectively] pay less,\u201D said Drake.","And while at least one company was previously reported to be in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation on VDFs, Drake highlights that for now, the foundation is working independently.","Unveiled last November, Filecoin had tentatively agreed to split costs for a VDF viability study and reevaluate at a later date whether or not to move forward with the necessary firmware development to bring VDF ideas to life.","A protocol researcher from Filecoin, who wished to remain unnamed, told CoinDesk:","The representative also affirmed that, at present, Filecoin is moving ahead \"separately\" from the Ethereum Foundation but may \"potentially co-fund third party proposals for exploratory VDF research with the Ethereum Foundation\" in the months ahead.","As such, Drake highlights that, for now, \u201Cthe Ethereum Foundation has moved on its own ... [funding] various researchers, generally small grants to the order of 10 and 25 thousand dollars.\u201D","But moving forward, Drake estimated that the foundation could come to a decision about whether or not to use the technology in as little as four months time.","\u201CSo the various studies that we\u2019ve just kicked off should take four to six months but I think that in about four months we\u2019ll be able to make an informed go, no-go decision,\" Drake said.","Ethereum image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"$15 million dollar","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"POA Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"25 thousand dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bram Cohen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation\"","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Drake","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Chia","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"RSA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Drake","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Drake","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Justin Drake","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Filecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chia","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VDF","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["ASICs","Ethereum","News","Filecoin","Technology News"],"authors":["Christine Kim"]}
