In a document released today, the FATF said that it had updated and improved its guidelines to \u201Cincorporate and supersede the 2019 guidance.\u201D","And while the body again underlined its commitment to the Travel Rule, and fired a warning, claiming that it had noted a \u201Clack of implementation of the Travel Rule by jurisdictions.\u201D This, it stated, was \u201Cacting as [a] disincentive to the private sector to invest in Travel Rule solutions.\u201D","It advised businesses to take the initiative with compliance, writing:","\u201CRegardless of the lack of regulation in the beneficiary jurisdiction, originating entities can require Travel Rule compliance from beneficiaries by contract or business practice.\u201D","In addition, the FATF added detail to its definitions of what a \u201Cvirtual asset\u201D and a virtual asset service provider (VASP) are, warning that \u201Cthere should not be a case where a relevant financial asset is not covered by the FATF standards.","Stablecoins fall under particular scrutiny in the document, with the body essentially concluding that fiat-pegged tokens are by its definition either cryptoassets or \u201Cfinancial assets.\u201D It concluded that if tokens are ruled to be cryptoassets, they must be policed accordingly, and if they are judged to be financial products they \u201Cshould be supervised according to that determination in the same manner as all other similarly categorized assets.\u201D","When it comes to stablecoin operators, it wrote that \u201Ca range of entities involved in stablecoin arrangements could qualify as VASPs.\u201D","On the subject of DeFi, the FATF appeared to suggest that many protocols are less \u201Cdecentralized\u201D than they might claim, explaining:","\u201CIt seems quite common for DeFi arrangements to call themselves decentralized when they actually include a person with control or sufficient influence, and jurisdictions should apply the VASP definition without respect to self-description.\u201D","Here are a few other key points from the updated guidance:","____","Learn more:Â \n\u2013 SWIFT-based FATF Rules Poor Fit for Crypto Industry, Says V20 Speaker\n\u2013 Regulators are Coming for the DeFi Goose and Its Golden Eggs\n\n\u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t Be Lulled\u2019 as European Commission Mulls a Crypto KYC Trap\n\u2013 FATF Makes Small Crypto Platforms Easy Prey For Big Players\n\n\u2013 Regulator is Like a \u2018Bulldozer\u2019 but Crypto is \u2018Resistant to State Control\u2019\n\u2013 Brace For \u2018Really Volatile\u2019 6-12 Months in Crypto Regulatory Sphere \u2013 Novogratz"],"entity":[{"type":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FATF Makes Small Crypto Platforms Easy Prey For Big Players\n\n\u2013 Regulator","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"G7","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VASP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Industry","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12 Months","content":"DATE"},{"type":"State Control","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Financial Action Task Force","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Regulatory Sphere \u2013 Novogratz","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency","DeFi","Exchange","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Privacy","Regulation"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
