USD 22 and, as prices have stabilized since the end of November, XRP bulls have trimmed monthly losses against the greenback to less than 19%. The coin is down by almost 1% in the past 24 hours, and is up by 1.3% in the past week. The price is still down by 28% in a year. XRP is also up against BTC and ETH by almost 5% in a week.","Top 10 coins:","XRP price chart:","Better weekly performers can be found in the top 20, where Tezos (XTZ) jumped 23%, Cosmos (ATOM) \u2013 11%.","However, despite this green week, XRP remains at a precarious position. Technically, bears are in a commanding position. From the XRP\/USD candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the down trend is pronounced. Also, the failure of XRP bulls to break and close above the middle Bollinger Band (BB), or the 20-day moving average, suggest that XRP may consolidate going forward.","Nonetheless, in relation to the lower BB, XRP price may after all recover. Candlesticks are diverging away from the lower BB indicating low bearish momentum and a possible accumulation. Moreover, the failure of bears to close below the November 2019 lows, combined with supportive fundamental events, may favor bulls in the immediate term.","Recent Ripple, XRP news:",""],"entity":[{"type":"Bollinger","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"23%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"11%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"28%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"XRP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"XRP\/USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Market","Ripple","XRP"],"authors":["Dalmas Ngetich"]}
