Meanwhile, 64% argue that blockchain technology will become widespread in video gaming within the next two years.","Echoing the same point of view, publisher of games Electronic Arts (EA) CEO Andrew Wilson said during an earnings call that NFTs and play-to-earn are the future of the gaming industry, even though it is still early to figure out how that would work.","Blockchain technology is valuable for the gaming industry as it allows for innovative and interesting gameplay, secures value by keeping and distributing money among players, and benefits users as adoption grows (network effects), the survey noted.","\u201CBlockchain is rapidly becoming a core building block for online games,\u201D commented Jean-Philippe Vergne, associate professor at UCL School of Management. \u201CWhat blockchain enables is incredibly compelling \u2014 players can now earn cryptocurrency while playing and trade digital goods both within and across games.\u201D","The meteoric rise of Axie Infinity, an NFT-based online video game that enables players to earn money while playing, prompted a surge in the overall awareness and popularity around NFT usage in games. Inspired by Axie, more games have adopted digital collectibles as an integral part of their ecosystem.","Meanwhile, experts argue that NFTs are poised to find their way into a broader set of industries. As previously reported, the management consulting firm Activate Consulting holds the view that NFTs will go mainstream by 2022.","\u201CAs more consumer time migrates to digital experiences and interest grows in the metaverse, we believe that every technology and media company will need an NFT strategy,\u201D Activate said in its 2022 tech and media outlook.","____","Learn more:","\u2013 Crypto-Gaming Is Exploding Into the Playful Future \n\u2013 Blockchain Users Shift Focus Towards Dapp Gaming\n\n\u2013 Alternatives Emerge as Blockchain Gaming Industry Tries to Avert Steam Ban\n\u2013 Games Are Propelling Growth in the Dapps Sphere as DeFi, NFT Lose Pace\n\n\u2013 Blockchain Game Axie Infinity Updates Fees as Token Hits All-Time Low\n\u2013 Axie Infinity Hitting Major Milestones One After The Other\n\n\u2013 Kadena Soars Further on DeFi, NFT Gaming News\n\u2013 Metaverse, NFTs and Gaming Token Prices Soar as Facebook Goes Meta"," "],"entity":[{"type":"Axie Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201D Activate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Time Low\n\u2013 Axie Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Philippe Vergne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"64%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Blockchain Users Shift Focus Towards Dapp Gaming\n\n\u2013 Alternatives Emerge as Blockchain Gaming Industry Tries","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT Gaming News\n\u2013 Metaverse","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"56%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kadena","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"72%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"EA)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stratis","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"58%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"47%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Andrew Wilson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Chris Trew","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT Lose Pace\n\n\u2013 Blockchain Game Axie Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Activate Consulting","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"UCL School of Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Forecast","Gaming","NFT","Non-fungible tokens"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
