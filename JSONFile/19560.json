They also hope this will relieve the pressure on its power grids.","Prosecution officials released photographs of the equipment they seized in a raid on the 35-year-old\u2019s mining \u201Cfarm\u201D in Cheremkhovo.","Prosecutors think the miner \u201Ccaused damage\u201D worth around $11,000, and have indicted him for \u201Ccausing property damage by deception or abuse of trust.\u201D","Investigators said the miner was active in early 2023 in Cheremkhovo. They claimed the man rented a plot of land with the intention of building a mining farm.","The plot included \u201Ca non-residential building with an integrated transformer substation.\u201D","The man allegedly \u201Cinstalled 214 pieces of computer equipment, which was used for mining cryptocurrency.\u201D","In itself, this is not a crime, as crypto mining still has no legal status in Russia. However, many so-called \u201Cgrey\u201D miners use illegal grid connections.","The prosecution claimed that the miner \u201Cillegally connected jumper wires to the substation\u2019s current transformers.\u201D","This allowed him to \u201Cunaccountably consume electricity\u201D without \u201Cproper payment.\u201D Police swooped on the farm in February 2023.","However, the case has taken over a year to process, due mainly to the fact that the man can only be charged with energy theft-related offenses.","The US government wants to seize Russian sovereign assets to help Ukraine fight and support its shattered economy. Some allies are wary of such a move and the precedent it might set https:\/\/t.co\/waRdky97B4","\u2014 Bloomberg Economics (@economics) March 16, 2024","","In Krasnoyarsk, prosecutors said that a group of illegal crypto mining farm operators stole $434,800 worth of electricity from the local grid.","Energy providers say they have developed new tools and methods that allow them to identify illegal miners faster."],"entity":[{"type":"Cheremkhovo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Krasnoyarsk","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Irkutsk Prosecution Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg Economics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Irkutsk","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Omsk","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dagestan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 16, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$11,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"early 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Abkhazia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$434,800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Irkutsk Oblast","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Khakassia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Mining","Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
