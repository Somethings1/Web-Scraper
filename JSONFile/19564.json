The report\u2019s authors advise new crypto investors to be patient, prudent, and careful.","There is no need to rush with crypto investments, as most of the opportunity lies before investors, the analysis says. ","In its evaluation of the \u201Ctoo late to invest\u201D argument, the study points to the fact that bitcoin\u2019s price has compounded at a 216% annual rate since the crypto\u2019s first recorded transaction in 2010. In contrast, over the same period, the total return of the S&P 500 index has compounded at 16% per year.","\u201CWe understand the \u2018too late to invest\u2019 argument but do not subscribe to it,\u201D the institute said. \u201CWe believe that focusing too much on past performance, especially with cryptocurrencies, can be misleading to new investors. [P]erformance numbers are skewed because most cryptocurrencies evolved from virtually zero.\u201D","The authors say they see cryptoassets in the \u201Cearly, but not too early\u201D investment stage, which is why they emphasize the need for investor education, as investment options are a bit behind and continue to mature.","The authors went on to compare three main ways to gain exposure to crypto: ","The analysts concluded that they are looking forward to regulators approving option 2, but, unsurprisingly, until that day comes, the provider of financial services itself recommends option 3: \u201CWe recommend professionally managed private placements for now, as the investment landscape is still maturing.\u201D ","The bank\u2019s analysts argue that crypto users are growing globally and rapidly off a relatively low base, and cryptoassets seem to be approaching a hyper-adoption phase that resembles the one experienced by online businesses during the mid-to-late 1990s.","The authors perceive bitcoin as entering a similar path that led to the dot-com bull market, and the later bubble burst, of the 1990s.","\u201CCrypto adoption rates seem to be following the path of other earlier advanced technologies, such as the internet. Should this trend continue, crypto \u201Ccould soon exit the early adoption phase and enter an inflection point of hyper-adoption,\u201D according to Wells Fargo Investment Institute.","For the above reason, the authors caution crypto investors to be careful and remember the lessons from the 1990s, as \u201Cpicking long-term technology winners is no walk in the park\u201D.","\u201CEarly-stage investing is often fraught with violent boom and bust cycles, as many a dot-com company and investor can attest from 20 years ago. More than 16,000 cryptocurrencies exist today, and if history is any guide, many will fail (or at least fail to scale),\u201D the analysis concludes.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 2021 Was \u2018Busiest Year by Far\u2019 for Bitcoin IRAs, Interest in Ethereum & Altcoins Grows\n\u2013 MicroStrategy Begins 2022 by Spending USD 25M on Bitcoin\n\n\u2013 Crypto Investment Trends in 2022: Brace for More Institutions and Meme Manias\n\u2013 5 Key Trends to Watch in 2022 According to Grayscale CEO\n\n\u2013 1B Crypto Users, Friendlier Regulations, Countries Adopting Crypto \u2013 Crypto.com\u2019s 2022 Predictions\n\u2013 Clients Increasingly Pushing Advisors to Invest in Crypto\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin to Hit USD 93K This Year, According to Less Optimistic Survey\n\u2013 3 Ways to Invest in Ethereum Without Buying ETH\n\n\u2013 4 DeFi Insurance Protocols Building Safety Nets for Crypto Investors\n\u2013 4 Social Listening Apps for Crypto, Reviewed for 2022"],"entity":[{"type":"Wells Fargo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2010","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wells Fargo Investment Institute","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Meme Manias\n\u2013 5 Key Trends to Watch","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"216%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"from 20 years ago","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1990s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum & Altcoins Grows\n\u2013 MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin\n\n\u2013 Crypto Investment Trends","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Grayscale CEO\n\n\u2013 1B Crypto Users","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friendlier Regulations","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u2019s Investment Institute","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Altcoins","Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency","Investing"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
