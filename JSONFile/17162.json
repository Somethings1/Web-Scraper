On February, 12, EtherRock number 46 sold for $496,658.","For those unfamiliar with the term \u2018sealed-bid auction\u2019 this is a type of auction in which bids are not viewed until the actual auction date and this instance Wednesday. The bids are sealed physically in an envelope, and will all be opened at once.","EtherRock NFTs are digital collectables representing ownership of virtual rocks on the Ethereum blockchain. Each EtherRock is a unique token, with ownership recorded on the blockchain, giving buyers the ability to buy, sell, and trade these digital rocks as they would physical collectables. They gained attention for their simplicity and scarcity, as only 100 EtherRocks exist, making them highly sought after by collectors in the NFT space.","In terms of total sales in 2023, Sotheby\u2019s has achieved more than $30 million in total digital art or NFT sales, which marked about a 50% increase year on year, a spokesperson told Cryptonews.com.","\u201CThere were many highlights in our sales in 2023. Namely, we held multiple sales from the Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collection, including a dedicated live auction in June that totalled more than $11 million. The highlight of that sale was a work by Dmitri Cherniak, called The Goose, which sold for $6.2 million,\u201D said a Sotheby\u2019s spokesperson.","NFTs have gained huge popularity in 2021, generating over $23 billion in trading volume, reports Rachel Wolfson from Cryptonews. In 2022, the NFT industry saw a major decline following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and a major market downturn. Â Wolfson reports that organizations want to help implement regulatory frameworks for NFTs, but confusion around these digital assets persists.","The GRAILS: Starry Night collection sold in the January auction for a total of $1,046,099.
