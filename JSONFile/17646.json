But the government could lose this income if it regulates crypto as gambling since the latter is exempt from capital gains tax. "],"entity":[{"type":"Ian Taylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK Treasury Select Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Treasury Select Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"House of Commons","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Harriett Baldwin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Select Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulation","Gambling","Regulation","UK"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
