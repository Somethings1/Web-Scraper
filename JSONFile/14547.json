So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?","It turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey\u2019s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises \u201Can extra decentralized web platform.\u201D","To land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 = 5.","Web5\u2019s core idea is to \u201Cput you in control of your data and identity\u201D \u2013 a core tenet of Web3\u2019s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet\u2019s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.","Dorsey\u2019s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data \u201Ccaptive in app silos,\u201D Web5 pushes for \u201Ca new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.\u201D","There are three pillars at Web5\u2019s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.","So, what\u2019s new here \u2013 apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey\u2019s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any \u201Cspecial utility tokens or subjective consensus\u201D that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.","In doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin\u2019s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5\u2019s nascent community already balked at TBD\u2019s attempt to trademark the term Web5.","The other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5\u2019s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user\u2019s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.","TBD\u2019s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to \u201Chelp her visualize her itinerary.\u201D Again, the idea is to tie data that\u2019s usually locked inside centralized services \u2013 something TBD calls \u201Ca massive, unworkable mess\u201D \u2013 to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user\u2019s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.","Will it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that\u2019s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).","One of the key things that distinguish TBD\u2019s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it\u2019s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5\u2019s announcement: \u201CJack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It\u2019s like a high school student saying \u2018yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it\u2019s meant to be.\u2019 It\u2019s naive.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"June, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum Name Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jack","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Domain Name Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Adrien Book","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2009","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Learn","industry","Beginner","Web3","Web5"],"authors":["Robert Stevens"]}
