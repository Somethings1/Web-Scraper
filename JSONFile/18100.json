failing to register the offer and sale of a cryptocurrency lending product that promised investors the opportunity to earn interest.","On Wednesday, the Florida-based company agreed to settle the charges by paying a $1.5 million penalty without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, as stated in an official statement.","TradeStation, a mainstream finance platform established in 1982 and acquired by the Japanese finance group Monex in 2011, expanded its services in 2020 to include cryptocurrency deposit accounts that allowed customers to earn interest.","According to filings, TradeStation had 11,122 active users participating in the interest feature globally as of 2021.","The SEC determined that TradeStation\u2019s crypto lending product constituted a security and did not qualify for a registration exemption.","Consequently, on June 30, 2022, TradeStation ceased offering the service in compliance with the SEC\u2019s order.","Earlier this year, TradeStation announced the termination of its crypto-related products and services in the United States, effective February 22.","The company, however, did not admit any wrongdoing.","TRADESTATION SETTLES WITH SEC FOR

Association (NASAA), a group of state securities regulators, regarding its crypto products.","The investigation involved a task force consisting of eight state securities regulators who examined TradeStation\u2019s crypto interest-earning program over the past year, according to NASAA\u2019s statement.","\u201CWhile we understand that investing in crypto asset securities may be alluring,
