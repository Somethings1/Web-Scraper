Meanwhile, the Cryptoverse is hard at work drawing parallels between GME and Bitcoin (BTC).","Source: Adobe\/wolterke","The Cryptoverse woke up this morning to a new token \u2013 a decentralized finance (DeFi) developer has created Wrapped Gamestop, an ETH\/GME token, \u201Cand folks aped into it. Amazing,\u201D wrote Microsoft Strategist Joe McCann.","Per Etherscan, total supply is 20m tokens, and it\u2019s showing nearly 270 transactions by 8:30 UTC Wednesday morning. Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) shows the price of GME rising quickly, trading at USD 5.25 at the time of writing, as well as USD 552,500 in volume and USD 414,000 in liquidity.","A wrapped token is an ERC-20 token, meaning it exists on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, and it\u2019s pegged to the value of another asset. However, people have been warning that this is not a wrapped token, as it\u2019s not pegged to anything, but just a regular ERC-20 token, and potentially a scam.","Exactly","Many more people in the comments section to McCann\u2019s post seem neither impressed nor happy about this twist, with, for example, Proof Systems and BarnBridge founder, Tyler Culler-Ward, stating that \u201CThis fuckery is how they\u2019ll try to blame us,\u201D and more commenters seeing a potential rug pull coming.","Meanwhile, popular crypto derivatives exchange FTX launched GameStop March 2021 Futures and a tokenized GME stock today.","GameStop is an American mall-based video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer, which is in the middle of closing nearly 2,000 shops, and which \u201Cmost people have written off more or less for dead,\u201D as Time wrote.","The worlds of both the crypto and the traditional markets noticed that this company\u2019s stocks started rising on January 22, jumping soon afterwards \u2013 in total rising nearly 205% in five days, from USD 48.56 to USD 147.98. Moreover, it more than doubled in the pre-market trading session today, hitting USD 365.","GME price chart:","Source: Google","Per a CNBC article, \u201CGameStop has more than 138% of its float shares sold short, the single most shorted name in the US stock market,\u201D with Caitlin Long, the Founder and CEO of Avanti Financial Group and former Wall Street insider, tweeting that this is a matter of \u201Ca dishonest ledger system. It allowed more shares to be sold than actually existed.\u201D","It\u2019s the r\/wallstreetbets subreddit, with 2.7m users, that many have credited with raising the stocks\u2019 price, as they\u2019ve focused their efforts on buying them, apparently driven by their resentment towards Wall Street, money printing that helps it, and regulators that protect it. User \u2018u\/consygiere\u2019, for example, wrote that it\u2019s no longer about GME, but that \u201Cretail does not want to be manipulated anymore\u201D, that the group is \u201Ctired of Market Manipulators and corrupted media\u201D and that \u201Cthis is time to act.\u201D","But this is also where many commenters drew parallels between GME and the world\u2019s number one crypto, stressing the relevance and power of decentralization, and also calling out the hypocrisy they find long-present in the traditional markets: \u201C\u201DMarket manipulation is only good when banksters do it!\u201D Okay, boomer,\u201D wrote \u2018Hypron.\u2019","\u201CThe activity in GameStop is more proof of concept that Bitcoin is going to work. How are you going to beat that decentralized crowd? That to me is more affirmation about decentralized finance,\u201D SkyBridge Capital\u2019s Anthony Scaramucci told Bloomberg.","River Financial Director Zev Mintz further argued that asset managers made the average person believe it was impossible to invest on their own for decades, but that the subreddit and Robinhood platform \u201Cchanged the game overnight.\u201D The Breakdown Podcast host Nathaniel Whittemore asked how can one not support what the subreddit members are doing, with some adding that this is in line with bitcoin philosophy. Others said they wished to see the same in crypto, stating \u201Cwait until they find out what they can all do to the bitcoin price,\u201D and noting that this is a \u201Crefreshing grey swan event.\u201D","Wait until they find crypto and realize that markets don't get halted in crypto.https:\/\/t.co\/fIY7UB3P9U"," ","\u201CThink about what the GME saga means,\u201D said Jimmy Song, a venture partner at Blockchain Capital and a Bitcoin developer\/educator. \u201CThere\u2019s so much money being printed that a determined group can leverage and short squeeze without much resistance. Until there\u2019s opportunity cost to lending, this is going to be par for the course.\u201D","Furthermore, CoinShares\u2018 Meltem Demirors compared the massive jump in stocks of companies like GameStop and the giant Tesla, joking how the mainstream media calls bitcoin volatile. Tyler Winklevoss, Co-Founder and CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, said that he were the GameStop CEO, \u201Cthe next move would be to purchase bitcoin and put it on the balance sheet.\u201D","Additionally, some commenters pointed to the arrival of decentralization, as the subreddit\u2019s moves are tanking a hedge fund. Per The Wall Street Journal, hedge fund Melvin Capital Management has been hit by a series of short bets, and among its short positions, Melvin bet against the surging GME stock.","BREAKING: Melvin Capital closes out of its GameStop position $GME@andrewrsorkin reports: pic.twitter.com\/5dx65M7zIP","Citadel and Point72 (formerly SAC) invested $3.75 billion in Melvin Capital. #WallStreetBets made a collective decision to pump #GameStop (wiping out the hedgefund)\n\nThis is the last time Wall Street ignores Twitter and Reddit.
