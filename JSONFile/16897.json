In that view, how the case plays out could define how the federal government can deal with decentralized trading platforms if they\u2019re seen as broad precedents. But the case may be much more straightforward than initial reactions suggested.","You\u2019re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.","Roman Storm, one of the three co-founders and developers behind the Tornado Cash mixer, was arrested last week. A second, Roman Semenov, has also been indicted. A third, Alexey Pertsev, faces trial in The Netherlands, where he was arrested last year.","Are law enforcement officials and federal governments going after Tornado Cash in an effort to tamp down on all efforts to make crypto transactions private? Or is the case a much more straightforward one about running a website that allowed North Korea to launder hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto?","So by now you\u2019ve seen that the U.S. Department of Justice brought charges against Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, two of the co-founders of Tornado Cash. One \u2013 Storm \u2013 was arrested last week, is now out on bail and will appear before a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York next week.","The indictments and arrest drew alarm from the crypto ecosystem, with concerned individuals decrying what they saw as efforts to regulate the very development and deployment of software intended to guarantee privacy in transactions.","First: A disclaimer that we don\u2019t yet have all the facts in the case. The DOJ hasn\u2019t presented much beyond an indictment with allegations, and some of the allegations need important details to contextualize the arguments, as we\u2019ll get into.","As far as the allegations themselves go, there are some facts that aren\u2019t really great for the industry: the DOJ alleged that Storm and Semenov created a program and user interface that allowed for malicious actors to launder up to $1 billion in crypto \u2013 including North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group, which allegedly moved \u201Chundreds of millions\u201D through the mixer (leading to last year\u2019s sanctions).","\u201CThese are individuals who were allegedly helping North Korea with economic transactions, allegedly in aid of a nuclear weapons program. Those are really, really serious allegations,\u201D said Anand Sithian, a former financial crimes prosecutor now with Crowell & Moring.","But even if the actions alleged by the government are true and Tornado Cash was used to launder money to North Korea making crypto live down to its reputation as being a tool for the dregs of humanity, the charges against the three accused are very specific and this case may not be an indictment of the industry as a whole or a power grab over privacy tools.","The charges themselves \u2013 conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money services business, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (in other words, violate sanctions) are all based on agreements between the indicted parties.","\u201CCertainly, the government will want to prove the substantive charge, that he actually did these things, but did these two individuals come to a meeting of the minds as to the conduct that is alleged to violate these federal statutes? That is what the government is going to have to prove,\u201D he said.","It may also be difficult to distinguish between the time period where the developers had control over Tornado Cash from when they didn\u2019t, he noted. Tornado Cash\u2019s developers famously burned their keys, arguing they no longer had the ability to unilaterally change the smart contract code.","\u201CIt's really hard to decipher if the government actually believes that they gave up control,\u201D he said. But, this issue may only apply to the money services business charge.","Moreover, the DOJ seems to be specifically arguing that it was the user interface at issue, rather than the smart contract itself, said Craig Timm, a senior director of anti-money laundering at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS).","\u201CYou've got to think about it sort of separate in your mind, the Tornado Cash smart contract from the user interface in the website, because I think that's exactly what the Department of Justice is doing,\u201D he said.","It seems unlikely the charges would be brought if there was no user interface, he added.","Tornado Cash\u2019s native TORN token is another complicating factor, Sithian said. According to the indictment, the defendants used the token to profit off of the operation of Tornado Cash as a service. The filing cites messages they sent to each other, where they allegedly discussed the need to pump TORN\u2019s price.","They converted their TORN token holdings into stablecoins, with Storm advising Semenov and Pertsev to create new wallets and further move the funds around, the indictment said. This allegation that the accused were using Tornado Cash to pad their own accounts is another serious blow against the accused and would again seem to argue that the indictment is more narrowly tailored than an attempt to rein in the industry.","The idea that \u201Cthey were in the business of making money off really bad actors [is] a compelling argument for a jury,\u201D he said. It can help prosecutors provide a reason for why Storm and Semenov were working on Tornado Cash, as opposed to the more altruistic argument that they just wanted to defend privacy.","Timm echoed this view, saying that prosecutors don\u2019t need to prove a motive but prosecutors would typically share one anyway for the jury.","\u201CWhat [the DOJ has] done here is lay out a bunch of evidence to try to paint the picture that these guys weren't just in it for software or development, they just weren't good Samaritans here,\u201D he said. \u201CThey were in this for money, and in fact, they were deceptive with their community about the money they were making [and] how they were profiting.\u201D","Coin Center, an industry group, took a competing view, saying the indictment\u2019s allegations suggest that Storm and Semenov remained within parameters defined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).","\u201CThe allegations include that the defendants: (a) paid for web hosting services for a user interface that allowed users to send transaction messages to the underlying smart contracts, (b) paid for a software repository (Github) where smart contract and user interface software and documentation was hosted, and (c) had (for a time before May 2020) \u201Ccomplete control\u201D over the Tornado Cash smart contracts,\u201D research director Peter Van Valkenburgh said in a blog post.","FinCEN\u2019s guidance went on to say that the publisher of anonymizing software would not be treated like a money transmitter. Storm and Semonov, if they were only the publishers of the Tornado Cash software, shouldn\u2019t be treated like the operators, Van Valkenburgh wrote.","Some parts of the case may hinge around the question of whether the defendants controlled Tornado Cash as a service.","Timm said the DOJ is trying to argue that Tornado Cash wasn\u2019t decentralized, that it was a centralized entity running a website and trying to profit off of the service being provided.","\u201CThe allegations aren't aimed at the smart contract. They're aimed at the user interface where they could have done any number of things that could have shut it down, they could have put controls in it, they could have done any of these things once they knew criminal money is here, but they didn't,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd they knew that their system was then designed to conceal it and make it easier for the criminals to move that money.\u201D","Van Valkenburgh wrote that to Coin Center\u2019s knowledge, the defendants never had the ability to directly access user funds, which would again suggest they weren\u2019t violating FinCEN guidance for money transmitters.","The details about exchanges that were hacked reaching out to the developers for assistance and being turned away may play in here.","Of course, what we don\u2019t know is whether the developers said they couldn\u2019t help the hacked exchanges or if they wouldn\u2019t help the hacked exchanges. If they said they couldn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t have control over the smart contract or any aspect of the user interface that would have allowed them to help, that\u2019s one story. If they said they wouldn\u2019t help, but could have, that\u2019s an entirely different one. The indictment only says the defendants responded to at least two emails from exchanges \u201Cdeclining to offer any assistance.\u201D","Brian Klein, Storm\u2019s attorney, said there was \u201Ca lot more to this story\u201D in a statement last week.","\u201CWe are incredibly disappointed that the prosecutors chose to charge Mr. Storm because he helped develop software, and they did so based on a novel legal theory with dangerous implications for all software developers,\u201D he said. So while it\u2019s possible that Klein is right and that when all the details are known, this case may prove a dangerous precedent for the crypto industry, from the facts that are known at present, it looks more targeted at Tornado Cash and the actors behind it rather than something that could have a chilling effect on the ecosystem.","The U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service published their proposed regulation for the long-awaited \u201Cbroker\u201D definition from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, otherwise known as the bipartisan infrastructure bill, otherwise known as that thing that occupied my every waking moment for like a month and had an immediate impact on job growth*.","*(At CoinDesk, which created the regulation team after that episode.)","The proposal itself walks through a definition for the term \u201Cbroker,\u201D capturing centralized crypto exchanges, payment processors, some hosted wallet providers, some unhosted wallet providers, some decentralized exchanges, etc. The industry wasn\u2019t immediately impressed, complaining that decentralized exchanges would have to either begin collecting know-your-customer information or otherwise shutting down.","Treasury has kicked off a comment period that ends on Oct. 30, 2023, allowing the general public to weigh in and provide feedback \u2013 especially to some of the more controversial issues, such as the decentralized exchange component.","Wednesday","If you\u2019ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you\u2019d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Twitter @nikhileshde.","You can also join the group conversation on Telegram.","See ya\u2019ll next week!"],"entity":[{"type":"the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Semonov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Oct. 30, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"North Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S. District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FinCEN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State of Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The Netherlands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"International Emergency Economic Powers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Klein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Roman Semenov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Semenov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lazarus Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Craig Timm","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"launder hundreds of millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Anand Sithian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alexey Pertsev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sithian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Peter Van Valkenburgh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Van Valkenburgh","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crowell & Moring","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Klein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Valkenburgh","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Newsletters","State of Crypto","Tornado Cash","Sanctions","IRS","taxes"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De"]}
