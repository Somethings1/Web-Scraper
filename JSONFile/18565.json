Grewal, launched an investigation on March 28 of last year over the \u201Cpossible offers and sales, since at least 2018, of \u2018certain securities, including, but not limited to ETH.\u2019\u201D","#ICYMI: New court filings indicate that @SECGov Chair Gary Gensler knowingly misled Congress when pressed on the classification of #ETH at a @FinancialCmte hearing to conduct oversight of his agency.","üìñ Read my full statement üëá pic.twitter.com\/8osMpbY6Iu","\u2014 Patrick McHenry (@PatrickMcHenry) April 30, 2024","","On April 18, 2023, Gensler played coy over whether or not ETH could be classified as a security while dodging questions from U.S. lawmakers.","\u201CNew court filings show this was an intentional attempt to misrepresent the Commission\u2019s position,\u201D McHenry stated. \u201CClassifying Ether as a security contradicts previous statements of the SEC and Chair Gensler \u2013 yet another example of the arbitrary and capricious nature of the agency\u2019s regulation by enforcement approach to digital assets.\u201D","Several crypto community members replied to McHenry on X to express their frustration over congressional inaction regarding the SEC\u2019s handling of cryptocurrency regulation.","\u201CGood work!

Earlier this month, the commission sent a Wells notice to Consensys, warning the ETH developer of an upcoming enforcement action.","Consensys has since filed back with its own litigation, citing regulatory overreach by the SEC.","\u201CThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201CSEC\u201D or the \u201CCommission\u201D) seeks to regulate ETH as a security, even though ETH bears none of the attributes of a security \u2014 and even though the SEC has previously told the world that ETH is not a security, and not within the SEC\u2019s statutory jurisdiction,\u201D the lawsuit stated.","McHenry used his statement condemning Genlser to further push the Financial Innovation for Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which House Republicans introduced last summer.","We have launched a Resources page for advocates to learn about the two important crypto-related bills working their way through congress right now:","1.
