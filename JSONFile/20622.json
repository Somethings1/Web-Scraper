It meant US allies intentionally created a situation that pushes Russia into default,\u201D he said.","Notably, Yamaoka warned against taking lightly the use of sanctions on financial infrastructure, saying that these are \u201Cemergency means\u201D that should never be over-used.","Lastly, the former central bank executive said it was unlikely that open and decentralized cryptoassets would be a feasible way for Russia to circumvent sanctions. These types of assets are too risky to use for large transfers of funds, Yamaoka opined.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 CBDCs in 2022: New Trials and Competition with Crypto\n\u2013 Joe Biden\u2019s Executive Order on Crypto Calls for Consumer Protection, CBDC Consideration, Tech Innovation Support\n\n\u2013 Elliptic Claims Breakthrough in Search for Russian Crypto Sanctions Evaders\n\u2013 Russia Has \u2018All the Needed Resources\u2019 to Create Its Own Crypto Infrastructure, an MP Claims\n\n\u2013 EU Clarifies Crypto-Related Sanctions on Russia & Belarus, But Questions Remain\n\u2013 Is Russia Really About to Cut Itself Off from the Internet?"],"entity":[{"type":"Bank of Japan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Defense","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank of Japan (BOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yamaoka","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Belarus","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Calls for Consumer Protection","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tech Innovation Support\n\n\u2013 Elliptic Claims Breakthrough in Search for Russian Crypto Sanctions Evaders","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hiromi Yamaoka","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Joe Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","Central Bank","China","Russia","Ukraine war","USA"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
