The committee\u2019s final report characterized these ongoing transactions as a repeated breach of securities market regulations.","This is not the first time Binance\u2019s Brazil unit has encountered regulatory challenges. ","The unit is already facing a CVM probe related to its sale of derivatives and had its proposed settlement offer worth 2 million reais rejected by the securities regulator in August. ","Consequently, further penalties and fines are anticipated for Binance\u2019s local unit.","Adding to Binance\u2019s woes in Brazil is the uncertain status of its proposed acquisition of Brazilian securities brokerage Sim;paul Investimentos, announced in March 2022. ","Binance had indicated that the approval of regulatory authorities, including the Central Bank of Brazil, would be required for the transaction. However, the necessary approval is yet to be obtained.","While grappling with the Brazilian regulatory landscape, Binance is also facing heightened scrutiny from regulators worldwide. ","In the US, the exchange has been grappbling with the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), both of which have filed lawsuits against the exchange and its CEO.","Back in June, the SEC sued Binance and its CEO for their \u201Cblatant disregard of the federal securities laws,\u201D unveiling 13 charges against the platform, including operating an unregistered exchange.","The agency accused Binance of breaking the law by offering unregistered securities to the general public, including its BNB token and BUSD stablecoin.","Likewise, the CFTC lawsuit accuses Binance of deliberately aiding US customers in evading restrictions on crypto trading imposed by its American affiliate. ","There have also been rumors about a potential indictment by the US Department of Justice against Zhao and Binance for possible violations of anti-money laundering laws. "],"entity":[{"type":"Ricardo Silva","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance Capital Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"paul Investimentos","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brazil","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank of Brazil","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2 million reais","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Brazil"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
