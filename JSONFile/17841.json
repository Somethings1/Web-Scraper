However, the past few years have borne witness to a notable shift in this paradigm. Technology has paved an alternate route, veering off the beaten path of conventional employment towards the flexibility of freelancing.","With the rapid proliferation of the internet, along with the strides made in digitizing work, freelancing has not just become feasible but also lucrative and convenient.
