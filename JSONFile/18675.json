As a result, Dencun\u2019s impact on Polygon may be less pronounced.","Polygon zkEVM, however, does leverage both zero-knowledge proofs (for improved privacy) and rollups. This means it can potentially benefit from the Dencun upgrade.","Watts, an engineer working on the project, notes that roughly 80% of zkEVM fees come from call data. By switching to the more efficient \u201Cblob\u201D storage post-Dencun, Polygon zkEVM looks to drastically reduce these fees.","Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade will bring benefits to various layer-2 platforms. These platforms will be able to offer lower transaction fees and higher throughput to their users.","Polygon zkEVM plans to integrate EIP-4844 proposals, with testing beginning on the testnet in April. The Feijoa upgrade will bring these changes to the mainnet approximately a month later.","In parallel to these scalability efforts, Polygon is also working on Polygon 2.0. A core part of this upgrade will be converting their current native token, MATIC, to POL.","This token swap intends to unify the entire Polygon ecosystem, serving as a medium of exchange and governance."],"entity":[{"type":"4844","content":"DATE"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"POL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Feijoa","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jarrod Watts","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MATIC","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Dencun","Ethereum","Polygon"],"authors":["Dalmas Ngetich"]}
