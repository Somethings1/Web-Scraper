Source: A video screenshot, Youtube\/Real Vision Finance","\u201CI am a long term dollar bear and gold bull but have been neutral on both for over six months. Lots of liquid poured into a funnel creates a torrent. Bitcoin maybe The Stimulus Asset. Doesn\u2019t look like gold is,\u201D he tweeted today.","Indeed, gold dropped by 68% vs BTC in the past 3 months and by 79% in a year. Meanwhile, USD dropped by 66% in the past 3 months and by 81% in a year.","#Gold, #Bitcoin, #Bonds Could Prevail When Equities Underperform: When the marketplace is rushing to one side of the boat, prudence suggests stepping up diversification, and the fact that Bitcoin inflows are rising vs. more traditional sectors favors enduring performance by the. pic.twitter.com\/M8Hrxy2kvx","Gold peaked in August 2020 at the same time @MicroStrategy chose #Bitcoin as the superior asset. https:\/\/t.co\/pbWnOgb4j2","As reported, Gundlach made a name for himself in the investment community in his former role as the head of the USD 9.3bn TCW Total Return Bond Fund, and Forbes claimed in 2018 that he was worth a cool USD 2bn. In a recent video interview, Gundlach stated that he was \u201Cnot at all a bitcoin hater.\u201D However, in the same interview, he also dropped this pearl: \u201CI don\u2019t believe in bitcoin. I think that it\u2019s a lie. I think that it\u2019s very tracked and traceable. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anonymous.\u201D Well, he\u2019s right about this \u2013 BTC is not really anonymous and its users can be traced. But let\u2019s see how the Taproot upgrade will change this.","\u201CThe question that I keep asking myself is \u201Chow long will gold bugs hang on to their gold while they watch the digital store of value gain market adoption?\u201D The short answer is that no one actually knows. Some people are likely to bail in the short term because of the US dollar price of bitcoin. Some people will take time to critically think about their world view and then change their mind. And a few people are more focused on being \u201Cproven right\u201D than actually \u201Cbeing right,\u201D Anthony \u2018Pomp\u2019 Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital wrote in his newsletter today.","According to him, holding on to your gold is the equivalent of physical letters.","\u201CDoes it get the job done? Yes, in the most basic sense, but it is drastically inferior to the digital application of communication,\u201D he added.","At the time of writing (13:47 UTC), BTC trades at USD 51,780 and is up by 2% in a day and 16% in a week. It rallied by 42% in a month and 434% in a year.","Â ","___","Learn more:\n\u2013 Tech Overtakes Bitcoin in High-Risk Trade Ranking Again\n\u2013 CFOs and Financial Advisors Have Different Concerns About Bitcoin\n\u2013 Investors Still Prefer Stocks To Bitcoin, But BTC Wins Over Gold \u2013 Survey"],"entity":[{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"August 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"42%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"66%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"79%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Gundlach","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Youtube\/Real Vision Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anthony Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"81%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Morgan Creek Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jeffrey Gundlach","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"TCW","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Forbes","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"434%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"#Bonds Could Prevail When Equities Underperform","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"68%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Anthony \u2018Pomp\u2019 Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DoubleLine Capital LP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Anthony Pompliano","Bitcoin","Investing"],"authors":["Linas Kmieliauskas"]}
