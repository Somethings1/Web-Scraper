But sike, too late \u2013 we've already got the ticker $CBDC For the people,By the people, putting power in the hands of the people. @Cointelegraph @bankofengland #CBDC #Stablecoins\u2026","\u2014 Central Bank Digital Currency (@SolanaCBDC) March 6, 2024","","Paul, now a senior director for CBDCs and financial market infrastructure at Fireblocks, said that the U.K. would benefit from the nature of its financial regulatory structure.","He highlighted that Joint regulatory frameworks that facilitate the FCA, Treasury, and BoE to collaborate without friction have always been key to seamless financial innovation and regulation in the UK.","As Paul revealed, the regulatory bodies would be saddled with different duties. The FCA would oversee stablecoins, while the BoE focuses on \u201Csystematically impatient\u201D operators.","Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC) have become key utilities in the crypto industry.","USDT, the most widely used stablecoin, with over 100 billion market capitalization, currently claims the third spot among global crypto assets.","In his whitepaper published by Fireblocks in November 2023, Paul proposed a system where Central banks issue CBDCs as a base asset backed by banknotes. This would increase people\u2019s trust in such digital assets.","\u201CEurope and the U.K. are saying we need to have a form of money denominated in euros and sterling, and we have the opportunity to say what that looks like,\u201D according to the white paper.","He cited concerns regarding Tether reserves transparency, a popular case in which USDT founders entered a legal battle with the New York Supreme Court in 2021.","UK lawmakers are considering providing a safe tokenized asset backed by central reserves instead of a stablecoin that mirrors the U.S. dollar.","The whitepaper concluded that stablecoins and CBDCs should be made to co-exist.","According to Paul, this can be made possible with programmable contracts allowing central banks to issue a CBDC to facilitate e-payment and serve as a utility on the blockchain.","He further emphasized the need for a uniform currency in fiat and digital forms to ease transactions and coordinate financial processes. Consequently, people can choose between a CBDC or existing stablecoins.","Crypto investors, who are mostly GenZ, might be inclined towards stablecoins, while the older generations would want to opt for a digital currency issued by the central bank.","Invariably, stablecoins and CBDCs should be made to co-exist as they serve specific needs and offer versatility in usage.","UK lawmakers affirmed that work is ongoing to create a regulatory bill to facilitate the creation and usage of CBDCs and stablecoins before the end of 2024."],"entity":[{"type":"United Kingdom","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coin Telegraph","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Former Bank of England (BoE","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paul","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Varun Paul","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York Supreme Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Conduct Authority (FCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$CBDC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Central Bank Digital Currency","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","Stablecoins","UK"],"authors":["Jimmy Aki"]}
