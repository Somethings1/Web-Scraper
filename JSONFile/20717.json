Most days aside from then haven\u2019t netted more than $200 million for the fund, though its streak of non-stop inflows stayed unbroken since January 11.","According to BitMEX Research, Fidelity has now received $5.2 billion of flows and holds a total BTC stash worth $7.49 billion.","[1\/4] Bitcoin ETF Flow \u2013 04 March 2024","All data in.

In total, flows into the two funds vastly outperformed sell pressure from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which amounted to $368 million, contributing to daily net flows worth $562.7 million.","Since its launch on January 11, Bitcoin ETFs surpassed an AUM of $50 billion on Tuesday, having started with just under $30 billion with Grayscale\u2019s stash included. New flows into the funds have brought in a net new $7.9 billion, with the rest of their gains coming from Bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation.","Altogether, the new nine Bitcoin ETFs\u2013excluding Grayscale\u2013have received over $17 billion of net flows. For context, the world\u2019s first gold ETF took two years to absorb $10 billion of inflows.","Gold\u2019s price tapped a new all-time high of $2,140 per ounce on Tuesday.
