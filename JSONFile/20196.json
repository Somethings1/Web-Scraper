But he said that this has changed in recent months.","The Korbit official claimed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2019s decision to approve Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has created a new \u201Cmarket dynamic.\u201D","This dynamic, Kim said, is now \u201Ccentered on stock market traders.\u201D The researcher said analysts have found that the price of Bitcoin is \u201Csensitive to trends in US spot ETFs.\u201D","NEW: ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Deutsche Bank survey via Reuters shows a big change in how people view #Bitcoin, as only 1%, down from 20% last year, consider it a fad. pic.twitter.com\/2BfCBP3w0U","\u2014 Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) April 9, 2024","","Kim also claimed that \u201Cmacro market factors\u201D such as \u201Cinterest rates, pandemics, policies, and wars\u201D once had a major impact on BTC markets.","However, the SEC\u2019s decision in January has proven to be a watershed, Kim said. He explained that crypto market trading bots in Asia and elsewhere have reportedly begun \u201Cbuying and selling\u201D following US stock traders and Bitcoin ETF trading patterns. Kim said:","\u201COver the past few months, Bitcoin tends to rise or fall during US stock market trading hours. Those same trends are being repeated during Asian market hours. BTC spot ETF approval seems to be behind this.\u201D","Bitcoin\u2019s \u201Chalving\u201D later this month, a software code update that is being championed as a catalyst for further price increases, may already be factored in to a degree, according to the head of the largest US crypto miner. https:\/\/t.co\/isj0DxpKGt","\u2014 Bloomberg Markets (@markets) April 9, 2024","","Kim said similar patterns were also being repeated in Bitcoin and crypto futures markets, leading to \u201Cthe liquidation of long and short positions.\u201D","Like other South Korean analysts, he predicted an inflow of \u201Cadditional institutions\u201D to the market.","If this were to occur in South Korea, this would likely have a seismic effect on the country\u2019s BTC market.","The nation\u2019s Bitcoin and altcoin markets are currently dominated by retail investors. Many institutional investors and funds have expressed an interest in BTC, but are yet to gain access to the markets.","Kim concluded that the above factors, as well as the forthcoming halving event, were \u201Clikely to create synergies to increase Bitcoin prices.\u201D","At the time of writing, the Democratic Party was poised to win a massive majority in April 10\u2019s parliamentary elections. Under 5% of votes remained to be counted at 3:30 AM KST.","Before the poll, the Democratic Party promised voters that it would pressure regulators to approve South Korean Bitcoin and altcoin ETFs."],"entity":[{"type":"Deutsche Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"3:30 AM KST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kim Min","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kim","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Democratic Party","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin News (","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 9, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Korbit Research Center","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg Markets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Price","South Korea","USA"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
