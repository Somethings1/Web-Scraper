The reason for this, it said, is that the distinct \u201Csaw pattern\u201D that characterizes Patoshi appeared at the birth of the network, and it mined the block that contained the bitcoins that were sent to Hal Finney \u2013 the first-ever recipient of a bitcoin transaction sent from Satoshi.","The fact that Satoshi\u2019s mining power was kept at a constant 60% of the entire network, combined with among other things the lack of spending, also suggests that Satoshi was \u201Conly interested in growing and protecting the young network,\u201D according to Whale Alert.","In addition to eliminating the risk of a 51% attack by controlling 60% of the network, this practice also helped Satoshi to maintain his \u201Cideal block time\u201D of around 10 minutes, in particular during periods when there was either too much or not enough activity on the network, the report said.","Given this information, Whale Alert was able to determine that an estimated 22,503 blocks out of the first 54,316 blocks mined, were indeed mined by Bitcoin\u2019s creator. Further, the team also concluded that at least 18 of the spent blocks were Satoshi\u2019s, which means that the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator in total spent BTC 907, with a price of less than USD 0.01 per coin at the time. This also means that BTC 1,122,693 were left unspent by Satoshi, Whale Alert wrote.","They concluded that the manner in which the early mining by Satoshi was carried out suggests that the bitcoin\u2019s mined were \u201Cpossibly a mere byproduct\u201D of his efforts to keep the network safe and stable. This makes it \u201Cunlikely\u201D that the remaining 1.12 million BTC will ever be spent, the article said, although it also added that \u201Cthe question remains why Satoshi didn\u2019t simply burn them in this case.\u201D","However, the practice of using nonce (the number that Bitcoin miners are solving for) patterns to determine the amount of bitcoin Satoshi mined has previously been called into question by BitMEX Research. According to a 2018 blog post, there is \u201Creasonable evidence\u201D to support the claim that \u201Ca dominant miner\u201D in 2009 mined around 700,000 BTC. Whether that miner was Satoshi, however, is \u201Ccertainly not conclusive.\u201D\n____\nLearn more:\nSomeone Just Moved 50 Bitcoins, Prompting Speculations It\u2019s Satoshi Nakamoto\nSatoshi-era Bitcoin Miner Calls Craig Wright a Fraud Using \u201CHis\u201D BTC Addresses"],"entity":[{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto\nSatoshi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Patoshi mined BT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Craig Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sergio Demian Lerner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2009","content":"DATE"},{"type":"51%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Satoshi\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hal Finney","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BitMEX Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Whale Alert","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Patoshi","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Mining","Satoshi Nakamoto"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
