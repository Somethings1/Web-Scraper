She accused him of using \u201Cfalse and misleading representations\u201D to entice customers to deposit billions of dollars. ","However, Mashinsky\u2019s lawyers have disputed the findings and accused her of cherry-picking from YouTube videos to \u201Cdemonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of Celsius\u2019s business, and Mashinsky\u2019s role therein.\u201D ","The company\u2019s bankruptcy filing in July last year was due to \u201Ccalamitous, external events\u201D beyond the control of the company, the filing stated. ","Specifically, the filing claimed that the collapse of Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin UST delivered billions of losses to the crypto lender\u2019s institutional counterparties and led to rapid mass withdrawals of assets from the platform.","The filing also said that the crypto lender\u2019s earn accounts were not securities under established law, denying James\u2019 suggestion that Celsius should have been registered with the state as a dealer in financial instruments.","Aside from Judge James, an independent examiner has also come to the conclusion that Celsius was lying to customers all along. ","Shoba Pillay, a court-appointed examiner that investigated Celsius\u2019 handling of CEL tokens and marketing strategy, said earlier this year that the company\u2019s business model \u201Cdiffered significantly\u201D from what it told customers. ","She even claimed that Celsius \u201Con a stand-alone basis has been insolvent since inception\u201D and that the crypto lender used CEL as the centerpiece of a scheme to enrich executives at customers\u2019 cost. ","According to the investigation, Celsius spent at least $558 million to purchase CEL tokens on open markets, which led to the token price soaring more than 14,000% since the start of mid-2020. ","The inflated price favored top company executives, including CEO Alex Mashinsky and co-founder Daniel Leon, who sold CEL worth at least $68.7 million and $9.74 million between 2018 and 2022, respectively. ","\u201CCelsius often sought to protect CEL from price drops that it attributed to Mr. Mashinsky\u2019s sales of large amounts of his personal CEL holdings. As a result of Mr. Mashinsky\u2019s sales, Celsius often increased the size of its resting orders to buy all of the CEL that Mr. Mashinsky and his other companies were selling.\u201D"," "],"entity":[{"type":"14,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$9.74 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Letitia James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$558 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"LLC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$68.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Celsius Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex Mashinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CEL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"earlier this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Shoba Pillay","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Daniel Leon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mashinsky","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Celsius Network"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
