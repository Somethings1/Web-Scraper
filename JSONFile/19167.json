(Updated at 17:47 UTC: updates throughout the entire text).","\u201CBelieve me when I tell you that I and my colleagues at Bridgewater are intently focusing on alternative storehold of wealth assets and expect Bridgewater to soon offer an alt-cash fund and a storehold of wealth fund in order to better deal with the devaluation of money and credit that we consider to be a major risk and opportunity, and Bitcoin won\u2019t escape our scrutiny,\u201D Dalio said in his newsletter to clients today, adding that he believes that \u201CBitcoin is one hell of an invention.\u201D","According to popular crypto researcher Hasu, who was the first to share excerpts from the newsletter, Dalio challenges the idea that Bitcoin is as scarce as people think, since there is an unlimited number of \u201CBitcoin-like assets\u201D. More innovative coins can probably carve out their own demand, and arguably we are already seeing that today.","\u201CThough Dalio knows about the ability to hold coins in cold storage, he\u2019s still concerned about the ability to shield them against cyber attacks and hold them securely. He warns that increasing digitization also increases systemic risk,\u201D Hasu added.","The researcher said he fully agrees with the statement that Bitcoin\u2019s Achilles heel is its lack of privacy.","\u201C[\u2026] Bitcoin looks like a long-duration option on a highly unknown future that I could put an amount of money in that I wouldn\u2019t mind losing about 80% of,\u201D according to Dalio.","However, he stressed that he\u2019s not an expert in Bitcoin and is \u201Ceager to be corrected and learn more.\u201D","Some other key statements by Dalio:","","Meanwhile, in the same newsletter, researchers at Bridgewater highlighted three challenges for BTC:","However, the researchers expect that the infrastructure around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally will continue to evolve and mature.","\u201CIn addition, the new paradigm that we are living in, with many government bonds no longer offering the same return or diversification characteristics and currencies facing greater risk of depreciation, could propel development of alternative storeholds of wealth faster than might otherwise have been the case,\u201D they said.","According to them, future challenges for BTC may also come from quantum computing, regulatory backlash, \u201Cor issues we haven\u2019t even determined yet.\u201D","\u201CEven if none of these materialize, Bitcoin, for now, feels more to us like an option on a potential storehold of wealth,\u201D they concluded.","At the time of writing (17:44 UTC), BTC trades at USD 32,243 and is up by almost 7% in a day, trimming its weekly losses to almost 9%. The price is up by 19% in a month and 264% in a year.\n____","Learn more:\nRay Dalio Trashes Cash as Store of Value, Avoids Questions on Bitcoin\nResponse to Ray Dalio: Banning Bitcoin Is a \u2018Game of Whack-a-Mole\u2019\nBitcoin Rallies Above USD 17,000, Ray Dalio In Doubt\nDid Ray Dalio Just Say You Should Buy Bitcoin?\nDid This USD 140B Manager Just Write a Guide For a Bitcoin Hodler?\nBlackRock Has USD 235bn in Alternatives And Now It\u2019s Coming For Bitcoin\nBitcoin Snowball Is Expected To Hit More Institutions in 2021","{no_ads}"],"entity":[{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin\nResponse","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD 140B Manager Just Write","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Rallies Above USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dalio","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock Has USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"264%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Store of Value","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ray Dalio","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hasu","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Hodler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bridgewater Associates","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bridgewater","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin\nBitcoin Snowball","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u201CBitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","Investing","Privacy"],"authors":["Linas Kmieliauskas"]}
