The assets, most likely cryptocurrencies having to be sold on the cheap, would then likely be managed by participants in the fundraising push.","Celsius has tapped restructuring advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday afternoon.","Goldman Sachs did not respond to a request for comment.","Celsius, which had more than $8 billion lent out to clients and $12 billion in assets under management as of May of this year, abruptly announced on June 12 that it would stop withdrawals from its platform, citing \u201Cextreme market conditions.\u201D The disclosure exacerbated those conditions, briefly sending bitcoin\u2019s price below $20,000.","In addition to hiring Alvarez & Marsal, Celsius has tapped restructuring attorneys from law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.

Citigroup declined to comment. Akin Gump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Celsius raised $750 million from investors last year, including Canada\u2019s second-largest pension fund, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), valuing the business at $3.25 billion.","UPDATE (June 24, 20:41 UTC): Adds clarifying sentence in third paragraph.","UPDATE (June 24, 21:10 UTC): Modifies headline."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$20,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Citigroup","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alvarez & Marsal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.25 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$750 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$12 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"afternoon","content":"TIME"},{"type":"$8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 12","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Celsius","Crypto Lending","Goldman Sachs"],"authors":["Tracy Wang"]}
