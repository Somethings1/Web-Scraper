Among other things, many of the largest exchanges in the crypto industry work with Genesis on various \u2018earn\u2019 and crypto savings programs that pay out yields to users.","The US-based exchange Gemini is among the exchanges that rely on Genesis for its Earn program.","Earlier this week, Gemini\u2019s trading platform went offline, causing some worry among users. But according to the exchange, the disruption was only due to a technical issue with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Gemini also stressed in its communication this week that customer funds are \u201Cheld 1:1 and available for withdrawal at any time.\u201D","Gemini exchange fully back online; all customer funds held on the Gemini exchange are held 1:1 and available for withdrawal at any time.","Among the companies that have said they have no exposure to Genesis is the major global exchange Binance, which this week said it uses its own nodes for on-chain staking \u201Cwhere possible.\u201D","Binance does not rely on Genesis or any other 3rd-party for our Earn products. For on-chain staking, Binance uses our own nodes where possible.\n\nStay #SAFU. üôè",""],"entity":[{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"WSJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Amazon Web Services (AWS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1bn","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$bn","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["FTX","Gemini"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
