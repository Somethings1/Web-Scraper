Governments leverage sandboxes to foster innovation by permitting firms to experiment with these technologies under relaxed regulatory stipulations.","This API-driven sandbox will facilitate participation from financial institutions, fintech enterprises, and other relevant stakeholders. Here, they can collaboratively develop and test innovative applications for the digital shekel.","During his address, Abir characterized the digital shekel as a \u201Cliability of the Bank of Israel to the public.\u201D","He emphasized its similarity to physical cash, where possession does not entail credit risk. He also clarified the need to distinguish the digital shekel from cryptocurrencies.","\u201CThe digital shekel will not be developed by some anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto,\u201D the official said. \u201CEveryone will know who is behind the digital shekel and who is responsible for it \u2013 it will be the central bank, the same Bank of Israel that stands behind the cash we all know and trust.\u201D","He asserted that the digital shekel\u2019s value would show stability, unlike cryptocurrencies which can experience significant fluctuations.","\u201CA digital shekel will always be worth one cash shekel which is always worth one shekel in a bank account,\u201D he said.","The official went on to highlight a CBDC\u2019s utility. He explained that it would facilitate various transactions currently not possible with cash, such as those conducted in the e-commerce domain.","The digital shekel will use a two-tiered operational model, enabling a broad spectrum of entities to participate as Payment Service Providers or Additional Services Providers within the platform.","Notably, the Bank of Israel intends to make the platform it constructs accessible not only to traditional banks, as is the current practice. But also to a wider range of participants, including payment companies, fintech firms, consumer clubs, and others."],"entity":[{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bank of Israel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Abir","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Andrew Abir","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Payment Service Providers or Additional Services Providers","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","Israel"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
