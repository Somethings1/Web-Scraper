Iris codes are used to confirm individuals\u2019 humanness by scanning their eyeballs with specialized devices called orbs.Â ","Once the iris code deletion is initiated, the user\u2019s World ID becomes invalid, and a six-month \u201Ccool-off\u201D period is enforced to prevent immediate re-verification. This measure ensures that individuals cannot immediately circumvent the unverification process.Â ","After the cool-off period, the iris code is permanently deleted and rendered unrecoverable. WorldcoinÂ collaboratedÂ with third-party privacy and security experts, including the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA), to develop this unverify option. BayLDA serves as the project\u2019s lead supervisory authority in the European Union.","The second update involves implementing in-person age verification checks at all Orb locations to ensure that the platform is only accessible to individuals aged 18 and above. Before undergoing World ID verification, individuals must undergo an on-site age verification check conducted by third-party personnel. This measure reinforces Worldcoin\u2019s existing policy of requiring users to be at least 18 years old to obtain a World ID.","These updates come as Worldcoin continues its mission to establish a global financial and identity network based on proof of personhood, a concept introduced by Altman when he launched the project in July 2023. However, Worldcoin has faced criticism from some quarters, with concerns regarding its centralization, privacy, and security implications.","Altman, the creator of OpenAI \u2014 the firm behind the natural language processing chatbot ChatGPT \u2014 launched Worldcoin in July 2023 to provide a \u201Cglobal financial and identity network based on proof of personhood.\u201D","To join the ecosystem, users must provide a scan of their iris through one of Worldcoin\u2019s specialized Orb hardware devices. This step provides \u201Cproof-of-personhood\u201D that is cryptographically secured and used as a World ID, founders Alex Blania and Sam Altman wrote in a letter upon the project\u2019s launch.","Worldcoin received mixed reactions from the community as many questioned its centralization, privacy and security.","Some governments have also been sceptical about Worldcoin\u2019s security and privacy. Worldcoin\u2019s European Union supervisor, BayLDA, reportedly began investigating the Cryptocurrency due to privacy concerns months before its official launch.","In late 2023, Worldcoin paused the offline orb verification function for users in India and aims to reinstate the service later in 2024.","In August 2023, Worldcoin was banned in Kenya, with the government halting all local activity associated with the platform, including biometric identification. A few months later, WorldcoinÂ saidÂ it was working with the Kenyan government to resume operations in 2024.","In March 2024, Worldcoin declared that it operated lawfully in all of the locations in which it is available and fully complies with related laws."],"entity":[{"type":"Alex Blania","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kenya","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"August 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 9, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"European Union","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New Updates","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bavarian State Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"India","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Sam Altman","Worldcoin","Worldcoin Orb"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
