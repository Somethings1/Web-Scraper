Both have donated to winning campaigns. Over the last two months, Defend American Jobs spent nearly $500,000 on media buys for Republican Mark Messmer, an Indiana state senator, who won the Republican nomination for Indiana\u2019s 8th district congressional seat this week.","Some of Protect Progress\u2019 crypto-friendly Democratic candidates, including Shomari Figures, who is running for a House seat in Alabama and Julie Johnson in Texas, have also won their primaries with media buy help.","\"It\u2019s at a level that we just haven\u2019t seen in past election cycles,\" said Kristin Smith, CEO of crypto lobbying group the Blockchain Association.","Industry insiders say the economic power of the industry has even spurred some crypto skeptics \u2013 including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who is up for re-election this year \u2013 to take a more open-minded stance towards crypto, lest they face well-funded opposition efforts from the industry.","\"Previously he was no friend of crypto but recently [Brown] said he was open to considering cryptocurrency legislation,\" said Kyle Bligen, director of financial policy at the tech-focused Chamber of Progress. \"I think he\u2019s cognizant of the money from outside industry groups that are looking for politicians that are open to reasonable, common-sense cryptocurrency policies and aren't just trying to prop up or support the traditional financial ecosystem without allowing for innovation.\"","Though the industry\u2019s past efforts to shape national-level election outcomes have been largely unsuccessful \u2013 and, in the case of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, criminal \u2013 the crypto industry\u2019s growing political influence now seems to have more staying power.","\"It\u2019s a much more sophisticated operation,\" Smith said. \"I feel like I used to walk around Washington, and people would say \u2018Oh, there\u2019s Kristin, she works for that little blockchain industry thing.\u2019 Now it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh wow, that\u2019s the powerful crypto industry and they\u2019re here to influence Washington and are pulling out all the tools to do it.\"","Though the crypto industry has largely focused its lobbying efforts on Congressional elections, the U.S. presidential election will also have a significant impact on crypto regulation.","According to at least one small poll commissioned by crypto investment firm Paradigm,, crypto-holding voters tend to prefer Donald Trump for president \u2013 although, according to other polls, the percentage of voters who own crypto is small. Polymarket bettors currently give Trump the slight edge to win (47% to Biden\u2019s 44%). But industry insiders are less certain on whether a Trump presidency would actually be better for crypto.","During his presidency Trump was outspoken about his distaste for crypto but has since softened his stance, even saying earlier this week that he was open to accepting crypto campaign donations. In an interviews with CNBC earlier this year, Trump admitted to dabbling in the markets himself (he has sold several tranches of non-fungible tokens) and said that he is \"not sure [he would] want to take it away at this point,\" though implied that he could move to curb crypto\u2019s influence if it ever undermined the dominance of the U.S. dollar.","Though Trump\u2019s crypto stance is shifting, it\u2019s still markedly less crypto-friendly than that of his former competitor for the Republican presidential nomination, Vivek Ramaswamy, who pledged to protect crypto developers and create a clear regulatory structure for crypto that would see most tokens as commodities.","Even though Ramawamy is no longer in the running \u2013 and will reportedly not be considered as Trump\u2019s running mate \u2013 industry insiders suggest his crypto policies could still have an influence on Trump if he\u2019s elected.","\"Trump looks to Vivek on tech and digital asset policy,\" claimed Lee Bratcher, founder and president of the Texas Blockchain Council. \"He didn\u2019t always do that, but when he saw how Vivek captured the Republican voter \u2013 and more centrist [voters] than Trump can capture \u2013 he\u2019s probably more interested in that [policy].\"","Industry insiders were split on whether a Biden re-election would be bad for the crypto industry.","Smith said it would likely be \"more of the same, unless [Securities and Exchange Commission Chair] Gary Gensler decides to step aside,\" meaning continued regulatory uncertainty and aggressive enforcement actions. A better, more open-minded SEC chair, she added, would be \"hugely helpful.\"","\"It\u2019s unfortunate because, at the beginning of the Biden Administration there was some interest in crypto \u2013 and then the industry imploded while they were doing all of their reports and as a result they\u2019re in a clearly negative spot right now,\" Smith said. \"On [Biden\u2019s] watch, the industry had some not-so-great moments and it\u2019s understandable that regulators are concerned.\"","Smith said that, while the crypto industry has largely moved on from the 2022 crypto collapse \u2013 including the implosions of FTX, Terra\/LUNA and Three Arrows Capital \u2013 regulators have much longer memories.","\"Having a fresh batch of regulators come in would be helpful in re-starting conversations,\" Smith said.","Others, like Bligen, seemed more hopeful for crypto-friendly legislation to pass post-election if Biden stays in power.","\"I can\u2019t say that if President Biden is reelected that that\u2019s a loss for cryptocurrency advocates, because currently in this regime Democrats and Republicans are working together on a bipartisan basis to produce productive and responsible cryptocurrency [legislation],\" said Bligen.","There are ongoing efforts in the current Congress to pass crypto legislation, including a bipartisan effort to regulate stablecoins.","Those efforts at legislation \u2013 which, in the past, have failed to find footing \u2013 still have significant hurdles to clear before being passed, including getting more members of Congress on board with crypto.","Bligen said that there are still many members of Congress who don\u2019t know much about crypto, and the things they do know about it \"come from flashy headlines about cryptocurrency scams, people misrepresenting coins, people being defrauded out of their money, massive crypto institutions failing \u2013 they view it from a protectionist angle,\" he said.","\"If you want to have more people that are friendly to crypto, every single office needs to be provided with a base understanding of what is cryptocurrency, why does it matter to my constituents and what is the policy landscape that regulates it. Everybody needs to know that,\" Bligen said. \"If you don\u2019t have that basic information, you\u2019re going to have members fumbling around, trying to grasp what blockchain technology is\u2026there needs to be more concerted education efforts. We\u2019re not just going to get to a more educated 2025, work has to be put in.\"","Bratcher added that, in addition to education efforts, the industry may have to compromise on certain issues \u2013 like privacy \u2013 in order to make real progress with lawmakers.","\"We stand at an interesting crossroads when it comes to privacy,\" Bratcher said, referencing the ongoing crackdown on bitcoin mixing services like Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet.","\"People in the digital assets industry want to prioritize privacy above everything else. When we work with government \u2013 state, local and national, and even with law enforcement \u2013 we don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to make grandiose claims around that, Bratcher added. \"There will have to be a balance between privacy and issues pertaining to money laundering and national security.\"","Bratcher said that bad behavior by privacy services like Samourai \u2013 which actively promoted its mixing services to \"dark\/grey market participants\" \u2013 makes working with elected officials much harder.","\"Tornado Cash is not a hill I\u2019m willing to die on,\" Bratcher said. \"We could lose a war if we choose to die on the hill of Tornado Cash.\"","Though the spotlight is on national elections, Bratcher and others \u2013 like Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin mining advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund \u2013 are focusing their efforts on state politics.","Porter\u2019s group has helped introduce bills in 16 U.S. states that provide protections for bitcoin mining and self-custody. The furthest along of the bills is in Oklahoma, where it has been passed in both the state House and Senate, and is awaiting a signature by Governor Kevin Stitt (R).","\"D.C. is fun and sexy. Tons of money is spent there, but so far we haven\u2019t seen any big wins \u2013 all of the important battles are happening at the state level,\" Porter said.","Porter said the industry should continue to build its presence in D.C. but said that it will not find the magical cure to all of its ills on Capitol Hill.","\"The way that we\u2019re going to do that is at the state level,\" Porter said. \"We\u2019re going to go state-by-state advocating for pro-digital assets policy using the states as a laboratory for democracy, eventually taking those good ideas and using them to influence policy at the federal level. Or at the bare minimum, creating a regulatory regime that protects people at the state level.\"","Porter\u2019s model for crypto regulation takes a page out of the cannabis industry\u2019s playbook \u2013 building up momentum and support in the states until the industry is powerful enough to shape federal regulations.","\"We\u2019re swinging for home runs over and over and over again in D.C. but we\u2019re not strong enough yet,\" Porter said. \"I just think we\u2019re further away from that than we realize\u2026The big story for me is that we need to be spending much more time at the state level, investing much more money, because the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent in D.C., if spent at the state level, would radically reshape the policy landscape and would radically change the dynamic for bitcoin and digital assets in America.\"","Edited by Nikhilesh De and Jesse Hamilton."],"entity":[{"type":"Trump","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ramawamy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kristin Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bratcher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"[Securities and Exchange Commission Chair","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sherrod Brown","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mark Messmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"47%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Terra\/LUNA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Texas Blockchain Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Action Fund \u2013","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kevin Stitt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Julie Johnson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bligen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kyle Bligen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vivek Ramaswamy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dennis Porter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Porter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$500,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lee Bratcher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"hundreds of millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Alabama","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jesse Hamilton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vivek","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"D.C.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"\" Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Oklahoma","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blockchain Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kristin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$85 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"44%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Senate Banking Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Shomari Figures","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chamber of Progress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Brown]","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ohio","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Biden Administration","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Calif.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Katie Porter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Protect Progress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Indiana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Election 2024","Joe Biden","Donald Trump","US Elections"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
