Kennedy Jr., who became the first U.S. presidential contender to embrace cryptocurrency contributions. ","Ron DeSantis is another presidential candidate known for his support toward cryptocurrencies. ","In his May 24 presidential bid announcement on Twitter, he said he would \u201Cprotect\u201D Bitcoin. \u201CAs president, we\u2019ll protect the ability to do things like Bitcoin,\u201D said DeSantis. ","Likewise, Kennedy has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin since the conference in Miami.","\u201CBitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more democratic,\u201D he said in a June tweet."],"entity":[{"type":"Ron DeSantis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Miami","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Robert F.
