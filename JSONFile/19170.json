This agreement followed charges that ShapeShift had offered unregistered securities to its customers.","Operating from Denver, Colorado, ShapeShift listed at least 79 crypto assets. Some were deemed unregistered securities by the SEC, using the Howey Test as the benchmark for determination.","Under the terms of the settlement, ShapeShift must pay the civil penalty within two weeks from the order\u2019s issuance. Additionally, the company agreed to a cease-and-desist order, halting any future violations.","\u201CThe Securities Exchange Act defines a dealer as \u2018any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities . . . for such person\u2019s own account through a broker or otherwise,\u2019\u201D the statement reads.","\u201CShapeShift meets this definition, according to the Commission, because \u2018[t]he crypto assets offered by ShapeShift included those that were offered and sold as investment contracts and, therefore, securities,\u2019\u201D the statement explained.","However, the commissioners claimed the SEC did not specify which of the 79 crypto assets traded by ShapeShift were considered investment contracts, nor did it offer any rationale for its determination.","Peirce and Uyeda argued that ShapeShift faces repercussions despite the significant time elapsed since its inception and business model shift, with the SEC alleging violations involving an unspecified subset of these assets as investment contracts, without providing clarity on its reasoning.","According to the statement, the SEC did not even allege any harm caused by ShapeShift, as both the platform and customers voluntarily transacted.","\u201CThe standards are so opaque and arbitrary that the Commission itself is unwilling to stand by its own analysis,\u201D said the commissioners. \u201CThe environment we have created for the crypto asset markets, especially as it relates to secondary trading, is untenable.\u201D","\u201CCases like this do not protect investors; they intimidate innovators and entrepreneurs. We respectfully dissent,\u201D Peirce and Uyeda concluded."],"entity":[{"type":"Hester Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peirce","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ShapeShift","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mark Uyeda","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Uyeda","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Denver","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Colorado","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$275,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["SEC","United States"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
