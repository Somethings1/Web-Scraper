However, the rapid development could lead to potential \u201Cdata silos\u201D where systems are unable to communicate with one another.","\u201CCurrently, there are significant differences in the technological paths and standards, including protocols, among economies, which presents a \u2018fragmentation\u2019 challenge and leads to \u2018data silos\u2019,\u201D said Yang.","\u201CTo date, 11 countries have fully launched their CBDCs, while others are in later stages of development,\u201D said Yang.","China\u2019s digital yuan has seen implementation across various applications, while the European Central Bank is in the process of preparing for a digital Euro. In India, commercial banks handle one million digital rupee transactions daily across the country.","Swift launched the second phase of its CBDC sandbox in July 2023, focusing on complex use cases in digital trade, digital assets, and foreign exchange networks for CBDC payments and settlements.","\u201CThe project lasted six months and involved 38 financial institutions from around the world, including regulators, commercial banks, and market infrastructures, involving applications of seven different CBDCs,\u201D said Yang.","Yang also emphasized the importance of interoperability in cross-border CBDC use. The sandbox results reaffirmed SWIFT\u2019s proposal to simplify digital transactions while allowing financial institutions to continue utilizing their existing infrastructures.","\u201CTests on the interaction between digital trade platforms and CBDC networks using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts have proven technically feasible for automating trade payments,\u201D stated Yang.","He indicated that Swift plans to expand its CBDC connector solution to test more extensive use cases in a comprehensive environment. This would include enhancing support for on-chain forex settlements and cross-border payments, addressing growing market demands."],"entity":[{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wen Yang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"European Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"India","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"21st Century Business Herald","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CBDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Euro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DLT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"July 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","SWIFT"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
