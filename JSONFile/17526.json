EigenLayer\u2019s total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $6.85 billion at the time of writing.","Elevating EigenLayer to a top-tier DeFi platform, this development reveals the potent allure of Ethereum restaking for investors seeking enhanced yields.","The influx of inflows has seen the liquid restaking platform rise to the fifth largest protocol in DeFi.","Protocol by Rankings:","1. Lido $26.781B\n2. Maker $8.306B\n3. AAVE $8.116B\n4. JustLend $6.971B\n5. EigenLayer $6.859B\n6. Uniswap $4.678B\n7. Rocket Pool $3.39B\n8. Spark $3.021B\n9. https:\/\/t.co\/tw1Zm4bWmL $2.948B\n10. Instadapp $2.526B","\u2013 DefiLlama","\u2014 Jungle Tales ðŸŒ´ (@jungletales69) February 14, 2024","","The increase in inflows occurred following EigenLayer\u2019s removal of its 200k ETH individual caps on liquid staking tokens on February 5, a move intended to \u201Cencourage organic demand,\u201D as detailed in a blog post on January 24. While the opportunity for liquid restaking closed on February 10, the subsequent $600 million surge in TVL can be linked to the rising prices of assets.","The boost in EigenLayer\u2019s TVL is reflective of a broader trend within the DeFi sector, where the total capital locked in DeFi protocols has reached $71.2 billion. This marks the highest point since June 2022 and is nearly double the total recorded during October\u2019s low of $36.8 billion.","Restaking has played a big role in the upward trajectory of DeFi protocols. Capital on the liquid restaking platform ether.fi has witnessed a 406% increase, reaching $1.19 billion in the past 30 days, while Puffer Finance has seen a 79% surge in the last week alone.","The TVL across various liquid restaking protocols, including EigenLayer, now stands at $10 billion, a major rise from December\u2019s figure of $350 million.\n","Ethereum restaking allows investors to stake their ETH on both the Ethereum blockchain and additional platforms, broadening the security and utility of their investments. While staking can be seen as establishing the groundwork for Ethereum\u2019s security, restaking expands the protocol\u2019s security capabilities to various applications on the network.","Restaking also involves earning additional yields on ETH that is already \u201Cstaked\u201D on the main Ethereum blockchain. Investors staking ether on Lido can currently achieve an annual yield of 3.7%, while EigenLayer provides a platform for these investors to \u201Crestake\u201D their ether for more rewards."],"entity":[{"type":"$6.859","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.93 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.73 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3.021","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$36.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.19 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$600 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$6.85 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$71.2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"79%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$4.678","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.948","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.526","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$8.116","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$350 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"3.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"406%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$26.781","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3.39","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lido","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"last week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$6.971","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"DefiLlama","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$8.306","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Puffer Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["eigenlayer","ETH","ethereum restaking"],"authors":["Brian Yue"]}
