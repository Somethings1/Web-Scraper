Two other lawyers from DLx Law \u2013 Delaware-based Gregory Strong and New York-based Sarah Chen \u2013 will join Cohen as partners in Cahill\u2019s newly expanded practice.","One of Wall Street\u2019s go-to law firms, Cahill\u2019s continued expansion into the crypto sphere is significant, indicating a growing need for crypto legal advice among traditional finance companies.","\u201CWhen I was a kid, the [Chicago] Bulls were the leading team in the NBA,\u201D Enzer said, \u201CThat\u2019s what this is \u2013 this is the crypto legal Dream Team.\u201D","Enzer, a former senior member of the SDNY\u2019s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, joined Cahill in November 2021 and subsequently established the firm\u2019s digital assets practice. The practice has a number of high profile clients, including notorious Bitfinex launderer Ilya \u201CDutch\u201D Lichtenstein, and major crypto companies like Coinbase.","But Enzer said that his expertise is in dispute resolution, including litigation and handling government enforcement actions \u2013 but when he needed expert advice on regulatory issues, he found himself regularly turning to Cohen and his team for help.","\u201CWe worked together for years,\u201D Enzer said. \u201CWith the explosive demand for our services, and the burgeoning demand for the specific advice that Lewis [Cohen] and his team offer, we thought it made sense to combine.\u201D","That combination, Enzer and Cohen hope, will make seeking comprehensive crypto legal advice easier for current and future clients.","\u201COne of the big frustrations for clients is that they don\u2019t really have a one-stop shop that they can go to to find crypto-native lawyers who speak the language, understand the technology,\u201D Enzer said. \u201CWhat you have is a tax crypto expert here, a crypto litigator there, a securities crypto expert at this place \u2013 it makes it very difficult for clients and more expensive, frankly, because they end up having to retain multiple law firms to get what they need.\u201D","In addition to making things easier on their clients, Cohen and Enzer both stressed the value that having more crypto-native lawyers on Cahill\u2019s staff will bring.","\u201CWe just see far too many lawyers struggle with what is a multi-sig, what is a roll-up, how does a bridge work? All of these things that, if you\u2019re going to give legal advice, you have to understand,\u201D Cohen said. \u201CPart of our mission here is educational. We very much believe in the open source blockchain ethos and we really want to bring that DNA into our practice.\u201D","Enzer said that a non-lawyer computer programmer from DLx Law will also join CahillNXT as a consultant, which he said will help Cahill and its clients \u201Cbridge the gap between computer code and the law.\u201D","\u201CMany big firms who dabble in this space do not speak the language, do not understand the tech, and therefore miss the opportunities to make the best arguments for their clients,\u201D Enzer said. \u201CIf you don\u2019t understand that, then you can\u2019t really help clients navigate the maze of regulations\u201D","Cohen has been a prominent member of the crypto legal community for years. In 2022, Cohen, Strong and Chen contributed to a paper arguing why cryptocurrencies are not securities.","DLx Law will continue to operate after Cohen, Strong and Chen\u2019s departure and, according to a Tuesday press release, \u201Ccontinues to zealously serve its existing clients and is welcoming new clients.\u201D","Co-founder Angela Angelovska-Wilson has been named Managing Partner of the firm.","\u201CI absolutely support [her] and am excited to see all that DLX can continue to do in its current format,\u201D Cohen told CoinDesk.","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"Southern District of New York (SDNY","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Delaware","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lewis Cohen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cahill Gordon & Reindel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Enzer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SDNY\u2019s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ilya \u201CDutch\u201D Lichtenstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chicago","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cahill","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NBA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lewis [Cohen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cohen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wilson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gregory Strong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cahill","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Angela Angelovska","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Samson \u201CSam\u201D Enzer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sarah Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cahill","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Lawyers","Lewis Cohen","Cahill gordon and reindel"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
