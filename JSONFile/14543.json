It is now looking for a new board member to replace Dorsey.","In Dec 2019, Dorsey announced that Twitter, which he then led as its CEO, was funding a small independent team to develop an \u201Copen and decentralized standard for social media,\u201D which Twitter would ultimately follow as well.","\u201CNew technologies have emerged to make a decentralized approach more viable,\u201D he said back then. \u201CBlockchain points to a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting, governance, and even monetization. Much work to be done, but the fundamentals are there.\u201D","The social networking service, which launched to the public in February, is led by CEO Jay Graber, a software engineer and entrepreneur.","The ascension of Nostr over the past couple of years, though, essentially obviated the need for BlueSky.","\"There is no Nostr board,\" Dorsey said on that platform Monday morning.","Edited by Stephen Alpher."],"entity":[{"type":"Stephen Alpher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BlueSky","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$245,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jack","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Jay Graber","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dec 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Jack Dorsey","Nostr","Bluesky"],"authors":["Helene Braun"]}
