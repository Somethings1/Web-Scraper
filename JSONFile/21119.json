Russian regions have also been complaining of power-related issues of late, with miners blamed again.","In a press release, Kazakhstan\u2019s energy ministry wrote that \u201Clarge power units with a capacity of 500 MW\u201D at its Ekibastuz GRES-1 and Ekibastuz GRES-2 plants had failed, with boiler problems in the EEC JSC plant causing a \u201Cdecrease in power generation.\u201D","The press release made no direct mention of crypto mining, but the timing of the draft law appears to indicate that there is a correlation between the two.","The ministry said central and regional power grid companies had already moved to \u201Climit the consumption of electricity by consumers\u201D who use excess power, with \u201Crestrictions introduced according to programs agreed with the local executive bodies.\u201D","Such \u201Cemergency shutdowns,\u201D the ministry noted, could \u201Clead to unacceptable deviations in power at the border with the Russian power system,\u201D threatening to \u201Coverload interstate power transmission lines, threatening a systemic accident.\u201D","It was important, the ministry concluded, to \u201Cprevent accidents and minimize the consequences of a decrease in generation in the power network.\u201D","Plus World noted that \u201Cgrey\u201D mining was \u201Cexpanding,\u201D with many miners looking to use electricity intended to power homes as energy for their mining endeavors, causing \u201Cshortages of electricity at certain times.\u201D","Alan Dordzhiev, the head of the Association of Blockchain and Data Centers of Kazakhstan, was quoted as stating that \u201Cany form of limitation is not very good news,\u201D but adding that he understood the reasons for the government\u2019s actions.","He said:","\u201CWe have definitely become a crypto power in terms of mining, but the question is now different \u2013 how should we regulate the industry so that only \u2018clean\u2019 miners remain, and how can we stop the grey ones?\u201D","Dordzhiev remarked that only building new nuclear power plants would provide a \u201Ccarbon-free solution.\u201D","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Miners on the Move: China\u2019s Crypto Mining Losses May Be Kazakhstan\u2019s Gain\n\u2013 Canaan Diversifies Business by Becoming a Bitcoin Miner In Kazakhstan\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining Costs Might Increase in Russia As Regions Complain\n\u2013 US Becomes Largest Bitcoin Mining Hub After China\u2019s Miner Exodus","\u2013 Nordic Bitcoin Miners Face Double Challenge, But Industry Still \u2018Quite Optimistic\u2019\n\u2013 Bitcoin Miners Secure More Nuclear Deals Amid Climate Concerns\n\n\u2013 Dominated by Institutions, Bitcoin Mining is also Possible from Home\n\u2013 How Bitcoin Mining Might Help Nations With Domestic Energy Production"],"entity":[{"type":"18.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ministry of Energy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alan Dordzhiev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Home\n\u2013 How Bitcoin Mining Might Help Nations With Domestic Energy Production","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the Association of Blockchain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CIS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Abkhazia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kazakhstan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nordic Bitcoin Miners Face Double Challenge","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"University of Cambridge","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Becomes Largest Bitcoin Mining Hub After China\u2019s Miner Exodus","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Data Centers of Kazakhstan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Miner In Kazakhstan\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining Costs Might Increase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"JSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Bitcoin","China","Mining","Regulation"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
