In their earlier letter to investors, the company had forecasted that BTC would hit 115,000 this August, and \u201Cit\u2019s essentially on pace to do that,\u201D said the CEO, \u201Cit hit all the monthly milestones up through April.\u201D","\u201CI do think it could double over the next five or six months. And I know that sounds crazy from your normal market standpoint [\u2026] but bitcoin has averaged more than tripling every year for ten years,\u201D he added.","Per Morehead, BTC has had \u201Ca very consistent\u201D ten-year compound annual growth rate of 233% a year. And while there have been some bubbles and bear markets, \u201Cif you zoom out and look at it from any multi-year perspective [\u2026] the log growth has been very consistent,\u201D he said, adding that \u201Cover the next several months, definitely over the next years, it will resume its trend.\u201D","BTC is still well below its ten-year compound annual growth, so we\u2019re not in a bubble or an over-priced territory, therefore it may be a good chance to buy, he suggested.","The ESG (environmental, social and governance) concerns \u201Chave come up more in the past three or four months,\u201D Morehead noted.","Bitcoin now-famously plunged on Thursday after Tesla chief\u2019s Elon Musk\u2019s comments about Bitcoin\u2019s energy use. Musk is \u201Ca mercurial person,\u201D changing corporate strategy pretty quickly in this case, but what\u2019s important to note, said Morehead, is that Tesla is staying long, not selling their BTC.","While it\u2019s important to think about the renewability of the resources used to secure the Bitcoin network, it\u2019s one of the many blockchains, and about 40% of the overall market capitalization, argued the CEO, while there are others that currently use no electricity or will switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) and use none. Therefore, the energy consumption discussions surrounding bitcoin shouldn\u2019t influence the industry as a whole.","","In a separate interview with Bloomberg TV, major crypto exchange Coinbase President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi also noted that the space is increasingly driving sustainable innovation, but added that she \u201Cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201D if there was something bigger behind Musk\u2019s move.","This week, Reuters reported that Tesla is seeking to enter the multi-billion dollar US renewable credit market, hoping to profit from the Biden administration\u2019s march toward new zero-emission goals.","Meanwhile, on-chain analysis firm Glassnode claims that \u201CHODLing demand from both miners and long term holders as overall spending patterns remain bullish,\u201D but that there are indications that a portion of BTC capital is rotating, mostly into ethereum (ETH).","The rate of miner accumulation is \u201Chistorically significant,\u201D with the current net position change comparing to only three instances in the last five years. Additionally, the demand by larger buyers exceeds available supply at the over-the-counter desks. Both trends align with the strong growth in institutional interest in the asset as a macro scale investment, the report said.","And while some commenters noted a rise in the number of accumulation addresses as \u201Canother leg up in Bitcoin,\u201D LMAX Group, an operator of institutional execution venues for FX and crypto trading, argued that should the price break the USD 47,000 level, it could drop to the USD 34,000 one.","At 09:21 UTC, BTC is trading at USD 50,561. It\u2019s up less than 1% in a day, trimming its weekly losses to almost 10%.\n____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Rise of YFI & Woofy May Be a Bellwether for Rotation From Ethereum To DeFi\n\u2013 Traders Rotate From Bitcoin To Alts, While JPMorgan Sees Ether As Overvalued","\u2013 Are Wall Street Giants Playing the \u2018Make-Bitcoin-Cheaper\u2019 Game Again?\n\u2013 If History Rhymes, ETH Might Hit USD 19K; Downside Risk Stronger Than BTC\u2019s"],"entity":[{"type":"YFI & Woofy May Be","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"233%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Alts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Pantera Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Morehead","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dan Morehead","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Emilie Choi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg TV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"LMAX Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tesla","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ecology","Elon Musk","Forecast","Mining"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
