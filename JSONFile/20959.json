No one technology alone will do that though.\u201D","When challenged to explain his \u201CETH hate,\u201D Dorsey responded:","\u201CFocus on one thing isn\u2019t hate of the others. I\u2019ve made my concerns known about others in comparison to Bitcoin. Key ones are founding principles, security and centralization.\u201D","Dorsey also wrote that he \u201Cagreed\u201D with a comment claiming that \u201Cevery account on Twitter should have a wallet address for storing NFTs\u201D \u2013 a move that \u201Cwould benefit the ETH ecosystem way more than it benefits Twitter.\u201D But he mused:","\u201CEvery account on Twitter being able to link to a Lightning [Network] wallet however\u2026\u201D","He also clarified that he was not focused on the \u201CLightning Network for NFTs,\u201D but instead \u201CLightning to enable a currency for the internet.\u201D","On Reddit, Dorsey\u2019s \u201Ccasual\u201D mention of the possibility of linking social media accounts to the network was met with much approval, with one Redditor urging the CEO to \u201Cget it done,\u201D and another claiming that the move could help push the price of BTC to the USD 100,000 mark before the year is done.","Regardless, the ETH community was clearly incensed by what it perceived as a slight. @iamDCinvestor opined that Dorsey\u2019s \u201Cdoubling down against Ethereum will become one of the biggest miscalculations in web history,\u201D as \u201Cthere is a huge opportunity for social networks and other websites ready to embrace Ethereum Web3, not lightning wallets linked to your account which no one cares about.\u201D","To this, Dorsey replied:","\u201CI\u2019m focused on a native currency for the internet. That is all.\u201D","On the r\/Ethereum subreddit, some members claimed that \u201CBTC doesn\u2019t threaten his business and wealth,\u201D while the inverse was true of ETH, while another wrote: \u201CETH will mean a decentralized internet that people like Dorsey and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerburg cannot manipulate and censor. No one will use their platforms when internet 3.0 is open and free.\u201D","Other notable figures in the crypto space also offered their two cents, with the General Counsel at Compound Finance Jake Chervinsky opining that he was \u201Ctotally happy\u201D for Dorsey to \u201Cfocus exclusively\u201D on Bitcoin, even if this was an \u201Cunpopular opinion.\u201D Some suggested that this opinion was actually \u201Cnot unpopular at all.\u201D","And the CEO of Solana Labs Anatoly Yakovenko offered a different kind of response, writing that \u201C99% of the challenge is just onboarding people to cryptography.\u201D","Yakovenko suggested that if Dorsey \u201Cgets 100 million using self custody, he will be able to contain them on bitcoin\u201D in the same way that Microsoft\u2019s \u201CBill Gates was able to contain the web on Internet Explorer.\u201D\n____","_____\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum Can Coexist With DeFi Bridging the Two\n\u2013 #ethgate Overshadows Big News But Helps Ethereum With Memes Amid Ethiopia Crisis","\u2013 Bitcoin Is Better Than Ethereum At These Four Things\n\u2013 Ethereum, Solana, Polygon & Co Form A New Hot Market Of Blockchains","\u2013 Ethereum Needs to Try Harder To Keep Its Dominance in a Multichain Future\n\u2013 Twitter\u2019s Bluesky Finds New Lead, Square Building the Bitcoin Wallet Team","\u2013 Here\u2019s What Everyone Missed in The Dorsey, Musk, and Wood Bitcoin Talk\n\u2013 Square Targets Bitcoin DeFi Business"],"entity":[{"type":"Solana Labs Anatoly Yakovenko","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethiopia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jake Chervinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"General Counsel at Compound Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dorsey \u201C","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bill Gates","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Microsoft","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wood Bitcoin Talk\n\u2013 Square Targets Bitcoin DeFi Business","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mark Zuckerburg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Big Tech","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The Dorsey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"99%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Polygon & Co","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"two cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Needs","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Community","Ethereum","Jack Dorsey","Lightning Network","Twitter"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
