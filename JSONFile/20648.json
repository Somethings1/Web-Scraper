The suit accuses two of the exchange\u2019s subsidiaries \u2014 Coinbase Global and Coinbase Asset Management \u2014 of repeatedly breaking securities laws since Coinbase began operating.","The lawsuit points out certain contradictions in Coinbase\u2019s user agreement. While identifying some crypto assets as securities, Coinbase never registered them for sale, it alleges.","Additionally, the lawsuit claims that Coinbase admits to acting as a \u201Csecurities broker\u201D and \u201Csecurities intermediary.\u201D","It also specifically identifies several digital assets listed on Coinbase as \u201Cdigital asset securities.\u201D These include Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Polygon (MATIC), Near Protocol (NEAR), Uniswap (UNI), and Solana (SOL).","\u201CCoinbase recognized early on the significant impact classifying digital assets as securities would have on the operation of the Coinbase Digital Asset Platforms,\u201D the lawsuit states. \u201CAnd for this reason chose, or was willfully blind, to not register the securities, persons, or broker-dealers as required by state law.\u201D","The exchange\u2019s failure to disclose key information is alleged to have amplified deceptive marketing tactics. These tactics, the lawsuit claims, were designed to pressure customers into buying digital asset securities on Coinbase.","A Coinbase spokesperson told Cryptonews that \u201Cthe claims in this litigation are legally baseless.\u201D","\u201CWe have full faith in the judicial process and look forward to addressing them in full at the appropriate time,\u201D they added.","Coinbase is already embroiled in a separate lawsuit with the SEC, which accuses the exchange of violating securities laws. The regulator specifically charged Coinbase with offering and selling unregistered securities through its staking program. Notably, the SEC did not target any Coinbase executives in its lawsuit.","Coinbase maintains that secondary sales of crypto assets don\u2019t qualify as securities. The exchange has appealed a judge\u2019s recent decision allowing the SEC lawsuit to proceed."],"entity":[{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase Asset Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase Digital Asset Platforms","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","Lawsuit"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
