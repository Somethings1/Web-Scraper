The bot promises to empower traders and investors with dynamic portfolio management capabilities, a company release wrote.","\u201CThe launch of our Smart Portfolio bot exemplifies Bitget\u2019s mission to keep providing innovative solutions that make crypto investing smarter,\u201D Gracy Chen, Managing Director at Bitget, said.","Â Bitget\u2019s Smart Portfolio bot promises to,","\u201CThis dynamic rebalancing aims to increase overall portfolio value over time versus simply holding assets,\u201D Bitget added.","Furthermore, the company noted that the bot constantly eyes short-term price gains and acts swiftly to lock the price before the value slumps. After locking the price, the bot reinvests those funds into undervalued coins poised to rally.","\u201CThis mechanism can steadily increase the total quantity of cryptocurrency assets held over time,\u201D it said.","There would be two rebalancing modes that are curated to their investment strategy, which users can choose from. These include percentage-of-portfolio rebalancing and calendar rebalancing.","When the percentage of allocation of digital assets deviates due to a change in market capitalization, percentage-of-portfolio mode is prompted, to give better coin proportions. On the other hand, calendar rebalancing refers to time-based adjustments that occur at fixed intervals.","\u201CThe intelligent bot analyzes price momentum and volatility to determine the optimal times to rebalance under both modes. Its algorithms aim to maximize returns from portfolio rebalancing based on market conditions.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"Gracy Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Smart Portfolio bot","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitget","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitget","CRYPTO","Derivatives","Trading"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
