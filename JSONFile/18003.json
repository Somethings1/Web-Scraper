Commenting on the dive into the world of NFTs, he explained that,","\u201CThrough my work, I strive to capture not just the vividness of nature, but the essence that animates it. The union between art and life \u2014 and now technology \u2014 extends my practice beyond the brush. I\u2019m looking forward to showing my work in a fresh context and engaging new audiences in a fun and spirited way.\u201D","Moreover, Slonem\u2019s physical artworks individually cost at least tens of thousands of dollars. His pieces have been featured in more than 350 international exhibitions at prestigious galleries and cultural institutions. These include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R.
