Over the past 14 days, the price of BTC went down 23%. The price went from about USD 39,390 seen on April 27 to the current (15:39 UTC) USD 31,315.","The mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted around every two weeks (or more precisely, every 2016 blocks) to maintain the normal 10-minute block time.
