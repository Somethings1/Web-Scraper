Kaplan keep Bankman-Fried at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to \u201Cfacilitate access to his appellate counsel\u201D as he works to overturn his sentence.","In addition to SBF\u2019s 25-year prison sentence, Judge Kaplan, who originally suggested that the former \u201Cking of crypto\u201D could be placed in a medium-security prison in his home state of California, ordered Bankman-Fried to pay an estimated $11 billion forfeiture.","Following his guilty verdict in November 2023, Bankman-Fried vowed to \u201Cvigorously\u201D fight the charges brought against him.","During his sentencing, lawyers for Bankman-Fried called the Metropolitan Detention Center \u201Cthe worst federal jail in the country,\u201D with prisoners having experienced issues such as lack of access to water and poor electricity.","According to the FTX founder\u2019s lawyers, he has struggled to find food that works for his vegan diet in prison \u2013 relying solely on water, peanut butter, and bread for sustenance.","First photo of Sam Bankman-Fried in jail at MDC Brooklyn.

Very excited to grow with them in the long term. It\u2019s not hard to genuinely figure out who cares about customers and who doesn\u2019t if you look past the insanity","\u2014 Ryan Salame (@rsalame7926) November 7, 2022","","Currently, Salame is out on a $1 million bond after pleading guilty in September 2023 to violating campaign finance laws and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.","The latest legal move by Bankman-Fried\u2019s camp signifies the formal start of what is sure to be a lengthy appeal process for the FTX founder.","At the time of publication, it is unclear when SBF will next appear in court."],"entity":[{"type":"Salame","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 20, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 7, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ryan Salame","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$11 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 17, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tiffany Fong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Metropolitan Detention Center","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lewis A.
