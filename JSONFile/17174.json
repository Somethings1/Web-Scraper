It was initially reported that approximately $46 million in digital assets were taken, but subsequent investigations revealed a sum closer to $49 million.","The attack drew further headlines when the unidentified hacker left an on-chain message for the KyberSwap team, saying that they would be open to negotiations once \u201Cfully rested.\u201D In response, KyberSwap offered the hacker a $4.6 million bounty in exchange for the recovery of 90% of the stolen funds.","However, the situation quickly deteriorated when the hacker threatened to delay negotiations if the KyberSwap team continued with its legal threats and its reportedly \u201Cunfriendly\u201D approach.","The hacker then altered their demands, saying that they wanted complete control over KyberSwap and its assets. This included temporary full authority and ownership of KyberDAO, the governance mechanism for Kyber, along with all associated documents.\n","In response to these demands, the KyberSwap team opted to initiate treasury grants for the victims of the hack. On December 2, 2023, the DEX announced grants for those who suffered losses in the exploit and had not recovered funds.","Treasury Grant Program Registration is now open for the following:","Type 1.
