The Act classified digital assets as cash and mandated reporting for taxpayers engaged in a trade or business when receiving digital assets exceeding $10,000.","The original rule required centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken to submit the necessary information about their clients to the IRS. On the other hand, the responsibility to submit information would shift to the individual when using peer-to-peer or non-custodial solutions.","\u201CThis particular provision requires Treasury and the IRS to issue regulations before it goes into effect,\u201D the new announcement has now clarified.","","It\u2019s important to note that the announcement does not impact the rules applicable before the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for cash received in the course of business.","Such transactions must still be reported on Form 8300, \u201CReport of Cash Payments over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business,\u201D within 15 days of cash receipt, the announcement said.","To provide clarity and procedures for reporting digital asset receipts and crypto tax on assets over $10,000, the Treasury and the IRS now plan to issue proposed regulations.","According to the two agencies, the public will be invited to provide written comments and, if requested, participate in a public hearing.","","The news that enforcement of the reporting rule has been halted received a positive reaction in the crypto community.","Among those who shared their reactions was the US-based advocacy group Blockchain Association, which called it \u201Ca positive step forward given its impossibility and breadth of reporting required.\u201D","IRS states 6050I\u2013a problematic provision of the infrastructure bill requiring reporting digital asset transactions over $10K\u2013isn't effective until there's more rulemaking.
