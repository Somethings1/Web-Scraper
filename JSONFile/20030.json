It allows for faster and cheaper transactions by creating a network of payment channels between participants.","The Bitcoin Lightning Network offers almost unlimited scalability in terms of transactions per second (TPS) as there is no upper bound. ","A single channel within the network has the capability to process more than 250 TPS, and there is no restriction on the number of channels that can be added to the network, allowing for further scalability and increased transaction capacity.","Fundamentally, the Lightning Network lets users engage in multiple off-chain transactions, with only initial and final wallet balances being written into the Bitcoin blockchain. ","This approach significantly increases the network\u2019s throughput and decreases transaction fees. It also adds another layer of user security and anonymity.","Payments firm Strike, which leverages Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network to provide a faster, cheaper, and more accessible alternative to traditional money transfer providers, has expanded its \u201CSend Globally\u201D service to Mexico.","The service allows users to send funds internationally, providing a convenient solution for cross-border transactions.","\u201CAt Strike, we believe that everyone should have equal access to better payments and financial stability,\u201D Strike CEO and founder Jack Mallers said. ","\u201CWe\u2019re excited to bring fast, low-cost cross-border payments via the Lightning Network to Mexico, enabling more people to send money home.\u201D","Since its launch in December 2022, Strike\u2019s Send Globally has expanded to over a dozen countries, including the Philippines, Vietnam, and Nigeria, among others, which are among the top 10 largest cross-border markets.","It is worth noting that Twitter also uses Strike to allow users to send and receive Bitcoin \u201Ctips\u201D via the Lightning Network. ","However, the Bitcoin Lightening Network is yet to find mainstream adoption.","According to data by DefiLlama, the Lightning Network\u2019s total liquidity is less than 0.5% that of Ether locked in DeFi contracts. "],"entity":[{"type":"Vietnam","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mexico","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"0.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Lightning","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Philippines","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jack Mallers","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nigeria","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Lightening Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DefiLlama","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Bitcoin","Lightning Network"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
