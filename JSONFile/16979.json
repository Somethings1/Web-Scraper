It entailed suspicious outflows from Rain\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP wallets. Funds from these wallets were swiftly transferred to instant exchanges, exchanged for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and then transferred to two addresses on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.","","The Ethereum address, with the ending suffix \u201C6c28,\u201D currently holds approximately 1,881 ETH, valued at $5.5 million. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin address ending in \u201Cprp2\u201D holds 137.9 BTC, valued at $8.6 million.","Arkham Intelligence data reveals that the Ethereum destination address received its funds from an address ending in \u201Cd609,\u201D which, in turn, received the funds from various Bitgo multi-signature wallets. Arkham has not explicitly attributed these wallets to Rain, however.","Although these wallets have not been explicitly identified as belonging to Rain, they were involved in sending over 590 ETH ($1.7 million), approximately 20 billion Shiba Inu ($481,000), 12,500 Chainlink ($169,000), $240,000 Tether (USDT), and $500,000 USD Coin (USDC). These tokens were promptly swapped for ETH on Uniswap. Additionally, the Uniswap account received funds from a Binance hot wallet.","Rain, a centralized crypto exchange based in Bahrain, primarily serves customers in Southwest Asia and the Middle East. Since its establishment, Rain has facilitated trading volumes exceeding $1 billion, according to regional news outlet The National.","The exchange\u2019s \u201Cpro\u201D version has been intermittently down since May 5, according to Rain\u2019s website, however.","In 2023, Rain obtained approval from Abu Dhabi\u2018s financial regulator to operate as a virtual asset brokerage and custody service provider.","","In recent posts, ZachXBT has made other substantial claims, including allegations that North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group laundered $200 million worth of cryptocurrency into fiat currency over a four-year period.","According to ZachXBT\u2019s analysis, at least $44 million worth of stolen crypto has been laundered through Paxful and Noones, utilizing two usernames, \u201CEasyGoatfish351\u201D and \u201CFairJunco470,\u201D which exhibited deposits and trading volumes corresponding to the stolen funds.","1\/ How Lazarus Group laundered $200M from 25+ crypto hacks to fiat from 2020 \u2013 2023https:\/\/t.co\/s8zNFwlamb","\u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) April 29, 2024","","The stolen funds were reportedly converted into Tether (USDT) stablecoin before being exchanged for cash and withdrawn. The Lazarus Group has historically relied on China-based over-the-counter traders for crypto-to-fiat conversions.","Additionally, ZachXBT reported that a holder of Bored Ape Yacht Club tokens fell victim to a phishing attack, losing three rare NFTs \u2013 BAYC #7531, BAYC #6736, and BAYC #2100.","Crypto investors lost $2 billion to hacks and exploits in the crypto industry last year, and an additional $333 million was stolen in the first quarter of this year."],"entity":[{"type":"6736","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"North Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"\/ How Lazarus Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bored Ape Yacht Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$481,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$169,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$44 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$8.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$200M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$240,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$5.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Southwest Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$200 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 13","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bahrain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2100","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lazarus Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 29, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$500,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$333 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Abu Dhabi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"The National","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$14.1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"7531","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["crypto scam","Rain","zachxbt"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
