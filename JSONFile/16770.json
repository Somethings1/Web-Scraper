When you hold money on a crypto exchange, like Binance, Kraken or Coinbase, those companies are in control of your cryptocurrencies. But when you move your crypto to a non-custodial wallet, you hold the keys to your wallet.","These wallets are the key to the decentralized web and serve as the primary way to interface with decentralized finance protocols, like lending protocols, decentralized exchanges or non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. Crypto wallets are so foundational to decentralized finance that some people on Twitter or Discord refer to themselves solely by their cryptocurrency wallet addresses \u2013 anyone who introduces themselves with a username that starts with \u201C0x\u201D is referring to their Ethereum address.","Unless you\u2019re running a huge company holding so much cryptocurrency that you need the watchful eye of a specialized custodian \u2013 a third party that looks after your crypto for you \u2013 you\u2019re looking for a non-custodial wallet. These are, as mentioned, wallets to which only you hold the keys. You may have read the adage, \u201Cnot your keys, not your crypto.\u201D This phrase is commonly used and stresses the importance of looking after your own crypto.","Read more: What Is Crypto Custody?","With non-custodial crypto wallets, your assets are backed by something called a private key. This functions as a password to your crypto wallet. You must shroud this in secrecy and never tell anyone about it. Should you lose your private key, you\u2019ll be able to use something called a secret phrase, or seed phrase. These are strings of 12 or 24 words that function as a backup password. It\u2019s important to hide these in a trusted place, ideally by holding parts of the phrase in different places. No company or individual should ever ask for your seed phrase \u2013 those that do are almost always scams looking to steal your funds.","Different blockchains require different wallets. MetaMask, one of the most popular wallets, supports just a handful of networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon (MATIC) and Avalanche (the common denominator is that these chains all support the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)). MetaMask does not support Solana or Bitcoin, however, there are a number of other options including Trust Wallet that do support Bitcoin.","NFT support requires special attention. Most wallets natively support fungible tokens, like ethereum, bitcoin and so on. But non-fungible tokens \u2013 crypto art, like Tyler Hobb\u2019s Fidenza or the Bored Ape Yacht Club \u2013 are handled a little differently. Marketplaces like OpenSea, although not wallets, will automatically display your Ethereum NFTs if you connect your wallets. Rainbow Wallet displays NFTs within its app.","When choosing a wallet, a good rule of thumb is to check which wallets are recommended by a coin\u2019s community. Solana\u2019s community champions SolFlare and Phantom, while Monero\u2019s sings the praises of Cake Wallet. Bitcoincash.org recommends the Bitcoin.com wallet, among others.","Read More: How to Store Your Bitcoin","Most of these wallets function as either desktop wallets, browser extensions or mobile wallets. Those that function as browser extensions are particularly useful when interfacing with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The websites of Uniswap, Aave, Compound and more each have a \u201Cconnect wallet\u201D button. This functionality replaces the \u201Clog in to Google\u201D\/ \u201Center your email and password\u201D of Web 2.","Setting up a crypto wallet only takes a couple of minutes. To get started with MetaMask, either download the app on your phone or install the browser extension. Then, MetaMask will ask you to set a password to the app, name your wallet, then write down your secret phrase (and then get you to check that you have done so). And that\u2019s it! You can then use your wallet to send or receive funds.","To find out your address, click the name of your wallet and MetaMask will copy it to your clipboard. Other wallets have near-identical setup processes.","Read more: How to Set Up a MetaMask Wallet","The above is a survey of the popular web wallets, also known as \u201Chot wallets\u201D because you need an internet connection to use them. Hardware wallets, known as \u201Ccold wallets\u201D, are physical devices like USB sticks that you plug into your computer and only connect to the internet when they\u2019re docked. This makes them more secure, albeit a little cumbersome to use. Popular brands include Trezor and Ledger. Unlike hot wallets, you\u2019ll need to buy these hardware wallets from the official suppliers. Purchasing them secondhand or from a non-trusted supplier is incredibly risky as devices could be faulty, tampered with or contain malware.","While cold wallets are considered the absolute safest place to store your crypto as they are entirely offline and cannot be hacked, they also pose a similar risk: If you lose the physical drive and\/or the private key, you will be unable to access your crypto. That\u2019s it. No password reset feature, no back button, zilch.","And it\u2019s not just new crypto users that fall foul to forgetting their passwords. Former chief technology officer of Ripple Labs, Stefan Thomas, admitted last year he\u2019d forgotten the password to his crypto wallet containing 7,002 bitcoin (worth approximately $300,000,000 as of March 22, 2022). He has just two guesses remaining before his device auto-encrypts his coins and makes them permanently irretrievable.","Online safety is paramount in this digital age, especially when investing and storing wealth in crypto assets.","Certain DeFi protocols can sometimes be supported by specific crypto wallet services. Here's what you need to know.","Con artists preying on people looking for love is nothing new, but the latest scams have moved on from asking you to buy gift cards to an array of crypto scams."],"entity":[{"type":"Bored Ape Yacht Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 22, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Uniswap","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Stefan Thomas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$300,000,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance Smart Chain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rainbow Wallet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tyler Hobb\u2019s Fidenza","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monero\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Technology","Beginner","Learn"],"authors":["Robert Stevens"]}
