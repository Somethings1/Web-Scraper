Your Crypto Operations in Russia, Washington Tells Japanese Exchanges & Miners","category":["Bitcoin News "],"content":[" ","Washington wants Japanese regulators to convince domestic crypto exchanges and miners to cut all ties with Russia, per a new report.","The Financial Times claimed that American \u201Cdiplomats\u201D believe \u201Cseveral\u201D Japanese crypto exchanges are \u201Cstill running in Russia,\u201D according to unnamed \u201Cpeople close to the situation.\u201D","The diplomats reportedly want Japanese miners to pull the plug on the crypto mining operations they are operating in the Irkutsk Oblast in Southern Siberia, according to \u201Ctwo people familiar with the matter.\u201D","Irkutsk has become a hotspot for miners both domestic and international in recent times, with activity stepping up after China\u2019s mining crackdown last year.","A number of major Japanese players from a variety of sectors have invested heavily in overseas crypto mining operations \u2013 due mainly to the prohibitively high costs of mining in Japan.","Although most Japanese operators have kept the exact location of their overseas mining operations a secret, a number of East Asian investors are known to have established mining centers in Central Asia, with some thought to be working in Siberia.","As previously reported, back in March, both Japan\u2019s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), and the Ministry of Finance told the country\u2019s exchanges to suspend all transactions with sanctioned Russians and Belarusians.","But Washington now wants exchanges to go a step further \u2013 and cease all Russia-related operations.","Cryptonews.com spoke to an employee at a Japanese exchange who, on condition of anonymity, stated that they were aware of an American request, but added that their firm had no dealings with Russian clients.","The same employee opined that this would likely be a bigger issue for crypto miners, who had spent \u201Cconsiderable amounts of money\u201D on creating mining-related \u201Cinfrastructure\u201D in \u201Cvarious European and Asian locations\u201D that enjoy access to low-cost energy.","The Financial Times, meanwhile, quoted the \u201Cformer head\u201D of an unnamed exchange as confirming that Japanese crypto exchanges had \u201Cencountered a recent intensification of pressure to relocate any mining or back-office operations out of Russia.\u201D","But, the former executive added, \u201Cat least one exchange\u201D has \u201Cdecided to maintain its business\u201D in Russia and was \u201Cskirting the regulation by setting up a shell company in Singapore and routing payments via that.\u201D","The media outlet quoted the FSA representatives as responding by \u201Crenewing demands\u201D that exchanges \u201Ccut any surviving relationships\u201D with Russia, \u201Cpeople close to three exchanges\u201D confirmed.","The US State Department was quoted as explaining that \u201CWashington and its allies\u201D were \u201Cunited in our determination to hold Russia to account\u201D for its actions in Ukraine, with a spokesperson stating:","\u201CWe will continue to evaluate the impacts of our measures and are prepared to take further measures.\u201D","The media outlet also stated that it had contacted a number of Japanese exchanges, who variously claimed not to \u201Chave any operations in Russia.\u201D","And an unnamed \u201Csenior\u201D exchange \u201Cexecutive\u201D was quoted as stating that they \u201Cknew of at least one mining company that had cut its relationships with Russia in June\u201D at Washington\u2019s request.","However, \u201Cpeople close to the situation\u201D were quoted as saying that some Japanese exchanges and crypto miners had \u201Cevolved a complex network of subsidiaries to continue working with their Russian operations.\u201D","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 New Law Would Ban Crypto Pay in Russia (Again)
