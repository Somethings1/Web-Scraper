The vulnerability has already been exploited by one hacker, who was able to obtain large quantities of BeautyChain\u2019s ERC20-based tokens.","ranimes wrote, \u201CThere is no traditional well-known security response mechanism in place to remedy these vulnerable contracts. Our results show that more than a dozen ERC20 contracts are also vulnerable to batchOverflow.\u201D","OKEx wrote, in an official notice, \u201CTo protect public interest, we have decided to suspend the deposits of all ERC-20 tokens until the bug is fixed. Also, we have contacted the affected token teams to conduct investigation and take necessary measures to prevent the attack.\u201D","However, Poloniex, who had earlier suspended ERC20 activities, stated in a Twitter post, \u201CDeposits and withdrawals for ERC20 tokens have now been re-enabled.\u201D","A number of token issuers and exchanges, including the likes of Bittrex, have taken to Twitter or their official blogs to claim their tokens and platforms are not susceptible to the batchOverflow bug. Experts believe that ERC20-based tokens account for almost 90% of all tokens."],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Poloniex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Poloniex","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Exchanges","OKEx","Trading"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
