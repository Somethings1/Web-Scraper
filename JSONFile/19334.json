Subsequently, on Dec. 13, 2023, the agency designated a longer period for approval, extending the time frame during which it could approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings surrounding approval or disapproval.","The latest filing from the SEC indicates that it has chosen to institute proceedings for approval or disapproval. The agency has requested commenters to address concerns related to fraud prevention, market manipulation, and investor protections, issues that were pivotal in the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.","Exact deadlines were not provided by the SEC. However, it stated that comments should be submitted within 21 days of publication in the Federal Register, with rebuttal comments due within 35 days of publication in the same.","SEC just delayed @InvescoUS & @galaxyhq's #Ethereum ETF. 100% expected and more delays will continue to happen in coming months.","The only date that matters for spot #ethereum ETFs at this time is May 23rd.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted the delay and emphasized May 23rd as a significant date, which marks VanEck\u2019s final deadline for its proposal.","The SEC is anticipated to decide on multiple similar proposals simultaneously, potentially including those with deadlines beyond VanEck\u2019s proposal.","Over the past weeks, the SEC has postponed various other spot Ethereum ETFs, including applications from Fidelity on Jan. 18, BlackRock on Jan. 24, and Grayscale on Jan. 25. These delays, however, do not alter the broader decision deadline set for May.","The likelihood of the SEC approving a spot Ethereum ETF remains uncertain. Polymarket prediction market currently suggests a 43% chance of approval by May. Seyffart estimates a 60% chance, while a JP Morgan member suggests 50%."],"entity":[{"type":"February 6, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nov. 8, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Federal Register","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"JP Morgan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dec. 13, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"43%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 23rd","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 25","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan. 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan. 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cboe","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Ethereum ETF","US SEC"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
