But even if a bounce is incoming, major cryptos mostly remain tightly locked within recent ranges.","Big moves are unlikely to come in anytime soon. The same can not be said for the highly illiquid on-chain crypto markets.","Indeed, these markets were set alight this week by GameStop icon Roaring Kitty\u2019s abrupt return.","Meme coins in honour of the 2021 meme stock craze leader have been spring up left, right and center.","Here are some top crypto gainers today as per Decentralized Exchange (DEX) analytics tool DEXScreener.","","A recently launched Solana meme coin called Roaring Kitty Wif Hat (RWIF), a combination of popular meme coin dogwifhat and Roaring Kitty, is ripping higher since its launch.","As per DEXScreener, it was last up 95,000% in the past 24 hours.

Hardly any end up having any long-term value.","Another just launched Solana meme coin called DUMB MONEY (DUMB) is also pumping.","As per DEXScreener, it was last up 36,000% in 24 hours with a market cap nearing $900,000.","DUMB MONEY is likely a play on the joke that the retail investors behind the meme stock\/meme coin pump are considered \u201Cdumb money\u201D, as opposed to \u201Csmart money\u201D hedge funds or institutional investors.","https:\/\/twitter.com\/Dumb_Money_Sol\/status\/1790428817539895663","But the meme stock craze of 2021 is widely hailed as an instance when Dumb Money won.","DUMB has just over $100,000 in locked liquidity, but could easily just be a pump-and-dump scheme.","BNB traders are getting in on the action, with just launched meme coin named GameStop (GME).","That is, of course, borrowing its name directly from the legendary meme stock.","Up 8,900% in 24 hours as per DEXScreener, GME\u2019s market cap was last $4.4 million.","The token has close to $1 million in unlocked liquidity, with over 1,500 unique wallets having traded it.","Again, traders must do their own due diligence and keep in mind that most newly issued tokens are scams.","Investing on newly launched meme coins is fraught with risk.","Yes, some of these coins might 100x. But the vast majority will fall flat, and investors might never be able to find the liquidity to sell.","Their fast price action tends to trigger FOMO in traders, who neglect to do the required due diligence.","A potentially better alternative to investing in just-launched meme coins is to invest in presales.","Here, traders have more time to research a project and see if it is a good fit for them.","Indeed, if a trader can reliably identify projects that end up gaining tract, they can make big gains.","Analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on the presale market.
