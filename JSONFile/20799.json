The Bitcoin ETFs secured $230 million in assets under management (AUM) in their inaugural week.","Based on data posted by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the $273 million AUM of virtual asset spot ETFs exceeded the $152 million AUM of virtual asset futures ETFs by nearly 80%."],"entity":[{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nangeng Zhang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Miner Mag","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"HashKey Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terawulf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong Stock Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"North American Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$152 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"67.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$230 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China Asset Management Co.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$273 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"71.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bosera International","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Hui","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Harvest Global Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$211.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"South China Morning Post","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"36%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Canaan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$175.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Hong Kong","Miner"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
