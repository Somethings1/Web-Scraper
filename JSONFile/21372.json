This supports bets that the Fed will be able to ease interest rates a few times before the end of 2024.","Decent CPI reading \u2013","US CPI (MoM \u2013 Apr): 0.3% vs. 0.4% exp. (prior 0.4%) Core (MoM): 0.3% vs. 0.3% exp. (prior 0.4%)","Growth stocks are like coiled springs, QT-taper and rate cuts later this year likely to trigger big rally.","\u2014 Puru Saxena (@saxena_puru) May 15, 2024","","The rise in the Bitcoin price came alongside a 0.9% jump to new all-time highs for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, US bond yields and the US Dollar Index slumped to one-month lows.","Traders are currently the most confident that there will be at least one cut by September in around one month. That\u2019s according to CME data, which shows a 71% money market implied probability of at least one cut by September.","One day ago, the money market implied that the probability of at least one cut by September was around 65%.","Bitcoin now faces a crucial technical barrier in the form of its 50DMA at $65,166. If the Bitcoin price breaks above here and its May highs to around $65,500, further short-term upside could follow.","The next level to watch would be the late-April highs around $67,000. Beyond that, the next target would be a retest of yearly highs in the $73,000 area.","Fears about a gradual rise in inflation in Q1 2024 have been a major headwind to Bitcoin in recent months.","Sticky inflation at the start of 2024 forced markets to price out aggressive Fed rate cuts. That\u2019s probably the biggest reason Bitcoin stalled after hitting new record highs near $74,000 ahead of the halving.","It has since been locked within a consolidation range, trading mostly between $60,000 and $70,000. However, while not a game-changer, the latest inflation reportÂ shows signs the Q1 inflation bump won\u2019t last.","If concerns about inflation ease from here on out, macroeconomic prospects could turn into a medium-term tailwind for Bitcoin rather than a headwind.","So, can the Bitcoin price break out of its multi-month range? Well, in recent years, May hasn\u2019t been a good month for Bitcoin.","As per bitcoinmonthlyreturn.com, Bitcoin fell 35% in 2021, 15.5% in 2022, and 7% in 2023. According to Steno Research, Bitcoin hasn\u2019t performed well during the middle months of the year over the past five years.","Sell in May and go away in Bitcoin? @MadsEberhardt with all the data here -> https:\/\/t.co\/OQyGuqYCFr pic.twitter.com\/qxyr0yZ2nN","\u2014 Andreas Steno Larsen (@AndreasSteno) May 2, 2024","","Post-halving rallies typically don\u2019t get going until 4-6 months after the halving. That would suggest no major push higher until after August.","But 2024 could be different as it\u2019s an election year. Markets tend to rally into elections, breaking them from their normal bearish summer conditions.","Both #Bitcoin and the stock market are consolidating right around ATH, in a presedential election year.","History has shown us the markets like to rally into the elections, so much so that the summer is bullish in 3 out of every 4 pre-election summers.","Buy in May and walk away.","\u2014 Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) May 15, 2024","","Long-term Bitcoin price risks remain strongly tilted to the upside.
