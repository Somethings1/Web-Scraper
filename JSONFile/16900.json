These new projects are about leveraging Ethereum\u2019s tech for unintended uses. They're about making crypto fun again.","","","They're about making money.","","","Yam Finance launched Tuesday. By the following day, YAM shot upwards of $160 per token and had some $700 million in no-loss collateral obligations under contract (aka yield farming). Early Thursday morning, YAM entered Github Valhalla when a bug locked the project\u2019s governance and $750,000 treasury. The token\u2019s market cap swiftly lost $60 million in 35 minutes. ","","","Read more: DeFi Meme Coin YAM Succumbs to Fatal \u2018Rebase\u2019 Bug, Makes Plans for \u2018YAM 2.0\u2019","","","From first heartbeat to last breath in less than 48 hours.
