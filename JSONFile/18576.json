However, of all crypto frauds in 2023, TRON blockchain hosted 45%, up from 41% in 2022.","A new report from TRM\u2019s blockchain intelligence team highlighted key trends in crypto illicit transactions through 2023.","Criminals have handled over $34 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, despite 9% decrease in year-on-year total illicit crypto funds from 2022-2023.","The report titled \u201CThe Illicit Crypto Economy,\u201D also noted that almost half of all illicit crypto volume (45% in 2023) occurred on the TRON blockchain.

For example, we know that USDT on TRON is the currency of choice for terrorist financing entities.\u201D","While the damage on TRON blockchain was massive, 2023 witnessed a significant decline in the volume of illicit funds. There was a 30% decrease than the $49.5 billion recorded in 2022.","Also, sanctions volume was the largest driver of the overall decline last year.
