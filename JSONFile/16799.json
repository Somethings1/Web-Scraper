They also added that Kwon has \u201Cno illegal profits \u2026 to disgorge.\u201D","Kwon remains in Montenegro, where he was arrested and jailed last year for attempting to use forged Costa Rican travel documents en route to Dubai.","The Montenegrin government is currently weighing competing extradition requests from both the U.S. and South Korea, Kwon\u2019s native country, which both hope to try him on criminal charges tied to the Terra collapse.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"$2.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$420 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"LUNA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$4.74 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Manhattan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Terra blockchain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chris Amani","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$5.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$520 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$65.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Luna Foundation Guard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$40 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Terraform Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"LFG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Costa Rican","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terraform","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Amani","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$150 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","terraform labs","Do Kwon","SEC"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
