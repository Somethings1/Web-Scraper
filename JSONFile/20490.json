Given the macroeconomic headwinds, it would not surprise me to see Bitcoin spend the whole year bouncing around between USD 30-60k \u2013 the sort of conditions that are terrible for traders, but rewarding for accumulators with a multi-year timeframe,\u201D Tan said.","Notably, half of the participants in Finder\u2019s panel, made up of 35 \u201Cindustry experts,\u201D said they believe bitcoin will eventually be overtaken by another coin as the most popular cryptoasset.","Among those who claimed bitcoin\u2019s days as the top crypto are numbered, Jeremy Cheah, an associate professor of decentralized finance at Nottingham Trent University, said the coin \u201Cconsumes too much energy and suffers from interoperability and scalability problems.\u201D","Meanwhile, 32% of the panelists also said they think that BTC should move from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model to proof-of-stake (PoS). However, only 9% said they believe BTC will actually make the move.","Overall, 67% of respondents said BTC is still a good buy, despite their price predictions being lower now than in the last survey from January. ","24% of the respondents opined that users who already hold BTC should not sell it, while 9% said that BTC holders should sell the coins they have.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Investors Show Rising Interest in Crypto, but Financial Illiteracy Hampers Investments \u2013 Surveys\n\u2013 About 50% of Surveyed Crypto Owners Made Their First Buy in 2021 \u2013 Gemini\n\n\u2013 Surging Consumer Interest in Crypto is Accelerating eCommerce Adoption \u2013 Survey\n\u2013 More Investors Enter Crypto But Keep Multiple Financial Service Providers \u2013 Survey\n\n\u2013 Most Surveyed US Financial Advisors Plan to Raise Crypto Allocations, 0% Plan to Reduce \u2013 Nasdaq\n\u2013 45% of Surveyed US Financial Advisors Expect to Use Crypto Per Clients\u2019 Request"],"entity":[{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"32%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Financial Illiteracy Hampers Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Asher Tan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"67%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"45%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"fintech","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crypto But Keep Multiple Financial Service Providers \u2013 Survey\n\n\u2013 Most Surveyed US Financial Advisors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nottingham Trent University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Martin Fröhler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"24%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Surveyed US Financial Advisors Expect to Use Crypto Per Clients\u2019 Request","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"0%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jeremy Cheah","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Forecast","Market","Proof-of-stake","Proof-of-work","Survey"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
