But the question remains: could this happen? And what would it truly mean?","Interestingly, in the livestream where the idea was first floated, CZ said that he hadn\u2019t slept for the last 29 hours \u2013 which could serve to explain why the idea was uttered in the first place.","In either case, while this hot discussion is still ongoing and is more complex than we could cover in this article, below are only the main points that are being discussed.","Although CZ tweeted that \u201Cit\u2019s not possible, bitcoin ledger is the most immutable ledger on the planet,\u201D evidence suggests otherwise. The short answer to the above question is yes. But as Twitter user Tanuki (@TanukiBTC) pointed out today, \u201CIt\u2019s technically also possible that ALL miners stop mining Bitcoin and let it die. But is it likely to happen?\u201D","Bitcoin counts on its miners to not share the same goals other than making a profit from mining bitcoins and transaction fees. But if a better profit could be made through the rollback than through your usual mining process, then the chances of the rollback happening would significantly increase, argues Ari Paul, CEO and co-founder of crypto asset investment firm BlockTower Capital.","\u201CIf the exchange could think of a way to reward every miner that supports the reorg [blockchain reorganization] more than those who oppose it, that might be enough to cause the reorg by turning this into a classic prisoner\u2019s dilemma,\u201D he explained on Twitter, adding, \u201CIs this a bad thing for Bitcoin? Maybe. One way to think about all of this is just as a cypherpunk free market rising organically from Satoshi\u2019s competitive mining game theory solution for BFT. It\u2019s just economic actors playing the game.\u201D","Bitcoin developer Tamas Blummer went even further, publishing a Medium post that explains the process of bribing miners to do a reorg.","\u201CConsequences of miners acting on a bribe could be severe as the reorg can disrupt regular transaction processing and diminish trust into the block chains immutability. Damages would be proportional to the length of the reorg. I think damage would be negligible if the rescue maneuver is executed within hours as a reorg of a few blocks is not an event in the technical sense and would not noticeable delay regular transaction processing,\u201D Blummer concluded.","However, this is also an expensive game to play. Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song even did the maths:","Moreover, it would take more than a day for miners to agree, which increases costs even more, Song stressed, adding that there are significant risks for miners also as they earn around BTC 1,800 per day from mining rewards in total.","\u201CThere\u2019s a reason people don\u2019t go around trying to reorg, even in the aftermath of large thefts. A reorg doesn\u2019t just hurt the thief, but it also hurts everyone else. There\u2019s a huge collective incentive to not change history,\u201D Song concluded in an article published today.","There are other problems too, as crypto researcher and analyst Willy Woo points out: \u201CIf you can convince 100% of miners to stop then divert work into the reorg then the network stops for at least as long as total time elapsed since hack to compute the reorg. If you convince less, say closer to 50% of the network, the time to reorg trends quickly to infinity.\u201D","The most popular Bitcoin educator Andreas M. Antonopoulos also joined the debate:","\u201CYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should,\u201D is a very memorable quote from Jurassic Park. Now it translates to crypto as well. Michael Novogratz, CEO of merchant bank dedicated to the digital assets and blockchain Galaxy Digital, tweets: \u201CI am shocked that [Changpeng Zhao] even went there. Talk of forking or reorganizing the blockchain is close to heresy. When the Ethereum community did it the project was like 5 months old. A baby. Bitcoin now has USD 100bn market cap and is a legitimate store of wealth.\u201D","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin \u2013 whose initial reaction to the idea was just tweeting \u201CWait what?\u201D \u2013 argues that the Ethereum \u201Creorg\u201D after the infamous DAO hack (which also gave birth to Ethereum Classic) wasn\u2019t even a reorg to begin with.","Still, CZ claims he\u2019s being misunderstood: \u201CTo clarify, the proposal by [Jeremy Rubin] & [James Prestwich] is to construct a [transaction] that would keep all other [transactions], and just distribute the hacker coins to miners (about 300 BTC\/block prod). It\u2019s not: rollback of any [transactions], nor is it reverting funds back to Binance.\u201D","Meanwhile, Vlad Zamfir, Ethereum\u2019s star researcher, writes, \u201CIt is indeed heretical to ask participants in blockchain governance for help recovering funds (#immutability) But it\u2019s no secret that it\u2019s technically possible to recover the funds.\u201D","However, what the future might bring?","As developer and Bitcoin enthusiast Udi Wertheimer points out, this is \u201Cwhat you should be concerned about\u201D:\n* \u201Cwhat if 500,000 BTC gets stolen?\n* what if exchange won\u2019t be able to make users whole?\n* lovable influencer says \u201Cwe should reorg\u201D?\u201D","\u201CI\u2019d argue it would still be impossible, but the drama could be real and painful. That\u2019s why we must learn from this, stay vigilant, and not cut people some slack when making these suggestions in \u201Ctest runs\u201D like this one,\u201D he said.","However, Tushar Jain, managing partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital, which is a well known investor in Binance Coin, argues that \u201Cas the Bitcoin block reward drops by ~90% in the next 10 years, it would make it much easier to roll back the chain in the case of hacks such as the recent Binance hack. In fact, this might become so common as to actually serve as a deterrent to future hacks.\u201D","In either case, while the rollback now looks possible only in theory, the community was quick to whip out Photoshop and make fun of the \u201CCZ as a god\u201D idea.",""],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jeremy Rubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlockTower Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin enthusiast Udi Wertheimer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Andreas M.
