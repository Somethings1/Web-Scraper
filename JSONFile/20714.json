While priced in if the approval indeed comes, what happens if it doesn\u2019t?","Discussing how the SEC Chair Gary Gensler is known for cracking down on the crypto industry, Goodman stated: \u201CAbsolutely! That\u2019s the one factor I think that people are forgetting here.\u201D","He implied that Gensler\u2019s dislike for all things crypto is not to be underestimated.","There are positive signs that may suggest that the approval is all but signed. This includes recent talks between the SEC officials and the ETF hopefuls.","\u201CBut Gary Gensler, we know, he never has anything good to say about crypto, does he? So he is the unknown factor in all this. And frankly, he is the boss.\u201D","Goodman argued that Gensler may require the applicants to do more work, which may delay the approval.","As an example, Goodman gave the custody and trading separation on exchanges recently discussed by Steve Scott and AJ Nary of digital asset custody firm BitGo.","Asked how far bitcoin could drop if there is no approval soon, Goodman stated that,","\u201CIf we get the impression from [the SEC] that the delay is open-ended as opposed to just \u2018oh, we just want a few final things done,\u2019 then it could be really bad.\u201D","Bitcoin, as seen before, is capable of \u201Cabsolutely terrifying falls\u201D that wipe out months of gains.","Looking at the futures funding rates on crypto exchanges, Goodman said, \u201Cthere are quite frothy levels.\u201D Many people are borrowing a lot of money now to buy BTC.","So if it did start falling, there could be a domino effect where accounts start getting liquidated because people have overstretched themselves \u201Con the old leverage.\u201D","While he personally is not selling, Goodman has \u201Clightened up\u201D his holdings after staying long for a while.","The price may continue to be influenced by the ETF excitement \u2013 assuming it gets approved. However, \u201Cthe risk-reward is not looking so great at this level,\u201D he opined.","He stressed, though, that this is just a short-term theory. BTC is known for its ability to drop and then jump back up just as fast.","Looking at it long-term, a Bitcoin ETF approval is \u201Cfantastic news,\u201D as many experts have noted.","Meanwhile, other drivers for 2024, Goodman opined, include gaming, artificial intelligence (AI), and decentralised social media."],"entity":[{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goodman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Glen Goodman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AJ Nary","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Steve Scott","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","Market","SEC"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
