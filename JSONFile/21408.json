However, renewable energy sources like solar and wind are intermittent, meaning that they don't produce energy when most of the consumption happens. Infrastructure building for renewable energy is capital-intensive and requires a power management system to store and distribute energy properly.","Under the agreement, Marathon and Kenyan policymakers will cooperate to \"better understand how to optimize renewable energy projects that produce surplus energy due to intermittency and seasonal variations,\" the press release said.","Marathon shares traded 6% higher at around $21 on Friday from yesterday's close, outperforming BTC's 1% advance over the past 24 hours.","Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."],"entity":[{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Green Energy Ambitions","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kenya","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$80 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Marathon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Miner Marathon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$21","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fred Thiel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Aoyon Ashraf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Marathon Digital (MARA","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Marathon Digital","Bitcoin Mining","Energy"],"authors":["Krisztian Sandor"]}
