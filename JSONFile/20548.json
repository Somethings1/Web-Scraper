But it was suspended amid the crypto market downturn in Nov. 2022.","James sued Gemini, Genesis and its parent company Digital Currency Group in October, alleging the Earn program caused investors over $1b in losses due to suspended withdrawals.","Thursday\u2019s settlement specifies the return of assets to former Earn customers and other creditors linked to Genesis. Additionally, it permanently bars Genesis from operating in New York.","Genesis Global settles lawsuit with NY State, promising return of all state authority assets to Gemini Earn customers.

The lender plans to seek approval from Judge Sean Lane on Feb. 14 for both the New York settlement and its liquidation plan.","DCG has opposed Genesis\u2019 bankruptcy plans, claiming they violate the law and favor a select group of creditors.","NYAG James accused Gemini of falsely promoting Earn as a \u201Chighly liquid investment\u201D and misleading investors about Genesis\u2019 financial stability. The attorney general argued that the firm was actually at a high risk of default, contrary to these claims.","The lawsuit also alleged that DCG collaborated with the companies to perpetuate the scheme.","Recently, Genesis separately settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a similar lawsuit over its Earn product. As part of the settlement, the SEC revealed that Genesis will pay $21m.","The SEC sued the company in Jan. 2023, alleging that the lender commingled assets from its Earn program with funds from other customers.","Both Gemini and Genesis faced allegations of violating federal financial laws, with the SEC also accusing them of selling and offering unregistered securities.
