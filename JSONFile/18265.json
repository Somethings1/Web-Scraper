Had a min to look at Ethena & USDe which may be the fastest-growing USD-denominated asset in the history of crypto.","I'm tweeting about structure\/mechanics here as I personally understand it. Not a Bitwise or personal investment.https:\/\/t.co\/xNQHvyIBZd","\u2014 Teddy Fusaro (@teddyfuse) April 10, 2024","","\u201CThere\u2019s a \u2018fund\u2019 (protocol) that accepts contributions from \u2018APs\u2019 & then issues \u2018units\u2019 (or USDe tokens),\u201D Fusaro continued. \u201CThe protocol then invests in a pre-determined portfolio.\u201D","Ethena\u2019s portfolio fundamentally consists of four assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), ETH liquid staking tokens, and Tether USDT. Those reserves are counterbalanced by equally weighted short perpetual futures exposure, creating a \u201Cdelta neutral\u201D portfolio that maintains the same dollar-denominated value over time.","But there\u2019s a catch: The reserves generate yield through their staked ETH and futures interest\u2014and that yield is paid out to all holders of USDe. Then, holders can stake their USDe themselves to receive sUSDe and receive even more yield.","\u201CAt scale, this interest can be massive.\u201D Fusaro wrote. \u201CIt is a gargantuan total addressable market.\u201D","By comparison, traditional stablecoins like USDT and USDC are backed by centralized reserves primarily consisting of cash and U.S. Treasury bills. The T-bills produce a hefty profit, but the companies backing them entirely retain their gains and do not distribute them to stablecoin holders.","USDe still carries unique risks like any other asset, however. According to Fusaro, these include exchange counterparty risk, exchange hacking risk, smart contract risk, and the risk that futures funding will go negative.","Nevertheless, if the stablecoin experiences any depegs or radical unwinds, Fusaro says it won\u2019t be in the same fashion as the Terra protocol\u2019s TerraUSD stablecoin in May 2022. TerraUSD collapsed in a downward spiral alongside the network\u2019s LUNA token due to internal algorithms that caused the latter token\u2019s supply to hyperinflate.","\u201CIs [USDe] going to work? Honestly, I do not know,\u201D wrote Fusaro. \u201CBut the rapid growth and immediate success are wild and the support that they have is obviously significant.\u201D","USDe now boasts a $2.36 billion market cap, compared to less than $1 billion exactly one month ago. According to Stablecoin Stats, this would make it the fourth-largest stablecoin in circulation."],"entity":[{"type":"delta","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.36 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethena & USDe","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethena","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 10, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tether USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 10 Twitter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fusaro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Stablecoin Stats","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Boston","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Amtrak","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitwise","Ethena"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
