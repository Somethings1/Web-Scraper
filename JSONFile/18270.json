The Pingshan District Administration for Market Regulation partnered with the Bank to launch the pilot pre-pay program.","Mr. Wang, one of the first consumers, purchased his new car at the Haodi Automobile Dealership and Service Center. The whole transaction was completed on the digital yuan platform launched by the Bank\u2019s Shenzhen branch.","This system would enable customers to pre-pay for cars using digital yuan, automating the contract and payment process.
