Illuvium has a revenue-sharing mechanism, which allows stakers in the protocol to benefit from in-game revenues. The company gives players an opportunity to earn ILV tokens.","\u201CThe concept of redirecting 100% of all in-game revenues to staked investors is a major draw for ILV, resonating strongly with our community,\u201D said Kieran Warwick, the co-founder and CEO, in a press release.","Illuvium can be more complex than some web3 games, the play-to-earn ecosystem is well-suited to strategists and offers several interconnected games. Recently listed on Epic Games, this AAA game has graphics and gameplay that have helped it reach a mainstream gaming audience. The ecosystem consists of four games in total, two of which are in early testing, reports Eric Huffman from Cryptonews.¬†","Illuviium Beyond, allows players to compete to create Illuvatars, collectible NFTs.","Illuvium Arena (PVP) is in early access. New players in Illuvium PVP get three pre-built decks of cards, with teams comprised of Illuvials you can take into the PVP arena. Upgrade your team with suits, weapons, and augments. As you progress through the game, leveling up your Illuvial, you can fuse to create new Illuvials or advanced forms of Illuvials that are more effective in battle.","The Illuvial ecosystem offers several ways to reward players: capture Illuvials to sell on the marketplace, capture a slot on the leaderboard to earn ILV, or stake ILV to earn ILV or sILV.","Last week, King River Capital, blockchain gaming firm Immutable and Polygon Labs announced they had teamed up to launch a $100 million gaming fund.","The trio said the new fund dubbed the \u201CInevitable Games Fund\u201D is a first of its kind \u201Cecosystem-agnostic fund\u201D and will identify high growth opportunities for investors. VC firm King River Capital will lead the investment process with other two specialist firms providing key sourcing and web3 gaming expertise.","In 2023, it is estimated that the blockchain gaming related rounds reached $1.7 billion which is a significant part of that has flowed to the 270 blockchain games in development on Immutable."],"entity":[{"type":"PVP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arrington Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kieran Warwick","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Illuvium PVP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$12 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Illuvium","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eric Huffman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"King River Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"AAA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Animoca Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Polygon Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Epic Games","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"second quarter 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$12M","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Gaming","Web3"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
