These contracts, if approved, would allow traders to speculate on the future price movements of these cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. The filing specifies details like contract size, settlement methods, and overall structure.","Coinbase is reportedly leveraging a self-certification process outlined in CFTC Regulation 40.2(a) to list these futures contracts. This process allows them to list the contracts without explicit CFTC authorization, as long as they comply with existing regulations.","Coinbase\u2019s developments into regulated futures trading in the US follow its acquisition of FairX, a CFTC-approved derivatives exchange, in 2022. This move, together with their August 2023 approval for futures trading despite SEC scrutiny, suggests a strategic shift.","At the time of the FairX acquisition, Coinbase expressed its aim of making the derivatives market more accessible to its millions of retail customers, indicating a strategic focus on broadening its services and catering to a broader range of investors.","Additionally, Coinbase defends listing Dogecoin futures by emphasizing its enduring popularity and active community, implying the memecoin has evolved into a more established cryptocurrency. Coinbase noted,","\u201CDogecoin\u2019s enduring popularity and the active community support suggest that it has transcended its origins as a meme to become a staple of the cryptocurrency world.\u201D","Following the announcement, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash saw significant price surges. As of the publication, DOGE experienced a 16.1% price increase, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was up by 11.4%, and Litecoin (LTC) increased by 7.8%, surpassing the overall crypto market\u2019s growth of 6.2% at the same time.","Coinbase\u2019s foray into future contracts has stirred the crypto community, as this move might raise some interesting regulatory questions. As of now, the CFTC still maintains its stance on Bitcoin and Ether, classifying them as commodities, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is more ambiguous as it recognizes all cryptocurrencies developed from Bitcoin as commodities. ","The decision to list futures contracts for Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash has raised eyebrows among market commentators. Some speculate that Coinbase might strategically stir some regulatory decisions, particularly by poking the SEC regarding its stance on crypto assets.","A recent X post from Bloomberg exchange-traded fund analyst James Seyffart speculated that Coinbase\u2019s futures filings might be a calculated move to prompt the SEC to reconsider its stance on categorizing cryptocurrencies with the exact proof-of-work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin as \u201Csecurities.\u201D","Seyffart wrote,","\u201CWonder if the SEC objects to these being classified \u2018commodities futures\u2019 vs \u2018 securities futures.\u2019 These [are all based on] Bitcoin so \u2018these are securities\u2019 claims would be hard to make after spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"BCH","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"7.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"August 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"11.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"16.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Coinbase Derivatives","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"6.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dogecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Christopher Kirkpatrick","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Cash","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"LTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","Dogecoin","Litecoin"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
