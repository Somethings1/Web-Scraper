It gave them anonymity and freedom from the oversight of intermediaries present in traditional payment systems.","The Chinese government has adopted a strict anti-crypto stance, cracking down on its adoption and prohibiting crypto-related activities with a series of bans.","In 2021, China bannedÂ cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency exchanges. Despite this, citizens have found ways to bypass regulation and access crypto assets through alternative means.","Decentralized exchanges have enabled China to continue trading crypto. Following the ban on centralized exchanges, the use of decentralized finance-based protocols saw a significant increase.","Some individuals defied the ban by using virtual private networks (VPNs) to mask their activities and trade undetected.","Through these efforts, China has ranked second globally in stablecoin holdings. 33.3% of investors holding multiple stablecoins, as per a Kyros Ventures report.","","Despite the crypto bans the recent Hong Kong spot Bitcoin and Etherium exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have given investors legal exposure to crypto assets.","China AMC CEO Yimei Li stated that these ETFs represent a significant milestone in making cryptocurrency investments more accessible to mainland Chinese investors.","Though crypto trading is banned in mainland China, Li said that the official launch of the ETFs presents a \u201Cnew opportunity\u201D for mainland Chinese investors in the future to \u201Cparticipate in this process.\u201D","This has proven to be true with mainland China investors flocking to the ETFs. As a result of this adoption, the Bitcoin ETFs secured $230 million in assets under management (AUM) in their inaugural week.","This exponential growth shows China\u2019s eagerness to adopt cryptocurrency despite the restrictive regulations imposed by the Chinese government."],"entity":[{"type":"May 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$230 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"33.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Longquanyi District Branch","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Li","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hunan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fujian","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1.9 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","China","Crypto crime"],"authors":["Harvey Hunter"]}
