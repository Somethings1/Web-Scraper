Data shows that the stablecoin market is currently valued at about $150 billion, and is expected to exceed $2.8 trillion by 2028.Â ","I'm delulu for a bull case","If we all think about it hard enough, maybe we can manifest it","Naur\u2026 let the numbers show you","1.

For example, XRP issuer Ripple recently announced plans to launch a United States dollar-backed stablecoin.Â ","A Ripple spokesperson told Cryptonews that bringing a trusted USD-backed stablecoin to the XRP Ledger will generate more use cases, liquidity, and opportunities for developers.Â ","\u201CRipple will leverage the stablecoin in its own payments solution to provide customers with the best payment experience, taking into account the region, time constraints, and associated fees,\u201D the spokesperson said.Â ","The spokesperson added that pairing the new stablecoin with XRP will enable more crypto liquidity to service additional cross-border payments demand.Â ","\u201CThis will enable critical on\/off ramps and support global scale,\u201D the spokesperson said. \u201CRipple\u2019s payment solution has already processed more than $50 billion in lifetime volume and has payout capabilities in 80 markets, which represents more than 90% of the daily FX market.\u201D","This is important, as stablecoin use cases such as this also promote dollar dominance since they increase access. Research from S&P Global shows that most USD-pegged stablecoins are actually issued outside of the U.S.","","\u201CMore stablecoin use cases are related to cross-border payments and on\/off ramping relative to crypto,\u201D said O\u2019Neil.Â ","To put this in perspective, O\u2019Neil mentioned that PayPal\u2019s stablecoin, PYUSD, is often used to facilitate payments and cross-border transactions in Latin America and the Caribbean.Â Â ","\u201CThe other aspect for stablecoins is remittances,\u201D O\u2019Neil added. \u201CTether is used heavily to send U.S. dollars to family and friends in emerging markets.\u201D","It\u2019s also worth mentioning that data from CoinGecko found that U.S. Dollar-backed stablecoins represent a 98.9% share of the stablecoin market.Â ","David Pope, Commissioner of The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, told Cryptonews that the global demand for dollars is strong, and stablecoins simplify and speed the transfer of ownership of those dollars.Â ","\u201CThis is why stablecoins are becoming a true, global asset class,\u201D Pope said.Â ","The growing demand for stablecoins has also caused lawmakers to focus on stablecoin legislation.Â ","In an April 17 announcement, United States Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins.","\u201CPassing a regulatory framework for stablecoins is absolutely critical to maintaining the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance, promoting responsible innovation, protecting consumers and cracking down on money laundering and illicit finance,\u201D Senator Gillibrand noted.","The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act also notes it would \u201Cprotect consumers by requiring stablecoin issuers to maintain one-to-one reserves and prohibiting unbacked, algorithmic stablecoins.\u201D","S&P Global Says US Stablecoin Adoption Could Soar Following New Rules","S&P Global highlighted how the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act could lead to a surge in U.S. stablecoin adoption due to the regulatory framework boosting confidence.

Financial Services Committee ranking member Representative Maxine Waters suggested in an April 24 interview with Bloomberg that lawmakers were progressing toward passing stablecoin legislation.","During the interview, she noted that she had been working \u201Cvery well together\u201D with committee chair Patrick McHenry on legislation on stablecoins and clawbacks for banks.Â ","While such legislation would likely prohibit algorithmic stablecoins like TerraUSD (UST) \u2013 which depegged from the U.S. dollar in 2022, O\u2019Neil believes that approving a stablecoin bill in the U.S. would accelerate institutional blockchain innovation.Â ","\u201CA clear federal framework would provide more comfort for institutions using stablecoins,\u201D he said. \u201CThis may also give banks comfort to issue stablecoins themselves, which in turn may bring banks into the stablecoin market.\u201DÂ ","Ripple\u2019s spokesperson also believes that now is the time for clear and definitive regulations on stablecoins.Â ","\u201CThe U.S. needs to assert its leadership to provide businesses and banks with the certainty required to proceed,\u201D the spokesperson said. \u201CWithout this, the U.S. risks moving technological innovation and user benefits overseas.\u201D","They added that Ripple is still reviewing how this legislation may impact its business, noting, however, that \u201CIt\u2019s clear that a stablecoin bill represents a significant step.\u201D","While this may be the case, Chainalysis Head of North America Policy Jason Somensatto told Cryptonews that Chainalysis believes the passage of such legislation will have little impact on stablecoin adoption in the U.S.Â ","Somensatto said stablecoin adoption is thriving globally despite the lack of an independent stablecoin-specific regulatory regime in the U.S.Â ","\u201CThis is likely because of the use case of stablecoins,\u201D he said. \u201CBy giving anyone in the world with an internet connection access to the stability of the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are a crucial solution for residents of countries facing currency volatility, both for preserving savings and even facilitating commerce.\u201D","Given this, Somensatto believes stablecoins will still rise as a global asset regardless of regulations.Â ","\u201CWhile major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether tend to dominate the headlines and offer gains that stablecoins lack, stablecoins have surpassed all other types of cryptocurrencies in usage, representing over half of all transaction volume in recent months,\u201D Somensatto noted.Â "],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"S&P Global\u2019s Digital Assets Research
