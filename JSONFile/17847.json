SBI Group companies will be among the first to leverage XRPL-powered supply chain finance solutions. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in Ripple\u2019s expansion into Japan.","With HashKey DX and SBI Group on board, Ripple aims to explore additional enterprise blockchain use cases, leveraging XRPL\u2019s capabilities to drive innovation and efficiency across various sectors.","Japan\u2019s financial market has historically been receptive to digital assets and cryptocurrencies.Â Recent developments include the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) announcing plans to explore various investment opportunities, including Bitcoin, gold, forests, and farmland.Â This favorable environment creates a conducive landscape for Ripple\u2019s XRPL solutions to gain traction.","Notably, traditional finance players increasingly embrace blockchain networks like XRPL, Stellar, and Ethereum to bring financial assets on-chain and address pain points in various value chains. Advanced conversations with financial institutions are ongoing, and tokenization projects are being explored to issue assets on the XRP ledger.","Ripple is set to enter the stablecoin market with its USD-pegged stablecoin, slated for release later this year. The stablecoin, fully collateralized by US dollar deposits and short-term US government treasuries, aims to provide stability and reliability to users. Ripple plans to ensure transparency and accountability by subjecting its reserve assets to regular audits by a third-party accounting firm, with monthly attestations published for public scrutiny.","Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, also recently projected a substantial growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market,Â envisioning its market capitalization surpassing $5 trillion by the end of the year. In an interview with CNBC, Garlinghouse attributed this anticipated surge to various macroeconomic factors. The factors include the launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event.","Currently, the combined market capitalization of the crypto market stands at $2.7 trillion, with Bitcoin\u2019s price hovering around $70,000. Garlinghouse\u2019s forecast implies a potential doubling of the market cap, culminating in a total valuation of $5.2 trillion.","Notably, Ripple has recently taken a decisive stance against the SEC\u2019s insistence on imposing $2 billion in penalties, filing an opposition motion that contests the regulatory body\u2019s proposed exorbitant fines. TheÂ detailed motion, released publicly by Ripple\u2019s defense attorney, James Filan, rebuts the SEC\u2019s penalties as excessively punitive, advocating for a far more modest $10 million penalty."],"entity":[{"type":"Tokyo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$5 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.7 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Garlinghouse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andy Dan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Brad Garlinghouse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SBI Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$70,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 30, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$5.2 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"HashKey Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"James Filan","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["HashKey","Ripple","SBI Group"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
