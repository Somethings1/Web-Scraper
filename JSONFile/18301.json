CoinDesk joined the case to advocate for the documents\u2019 release, arguing that it was in the public interest. ","Tether opposed CoinDesk\u2019s involvement, but a New York judge dismissed their opposition.","In their recent statement, Tether and Bitfinex expressed their willingness to engage constructively with journalists and regulatory authorities who adhere to ethical reporting standards and respect data privacy boundaries. ","\u201CWe remain open to constructive engagement with journalists and regulatory authorities who adhere to ethical reporting standards and respect data privacy boundaries.\u201D","Tether\u2019s USDT is currently the largest stablecoin in the world, with a value of approximately $88.5 billion. ","It plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by facilitating the movement of funds globally. ","However, concerns have been raised about the use of USDT in illicit activities. ","Zeke Faux, in his book \u201CNumber Goes Up,\u201D highlighted instances of USDT being involved in scams, including \u201Cpig butchering\u201D scams. ","It is worth noting that Tether and the U.S. Department of Justice recently announced the freezing of funds associated with such scams.","Furthermore, there has been some controvery surrounding the backing of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin.","USDT is a type of stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, with the intention of providing stability and reliability in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. ","However, questions have arisen regarding the extent to which USDT is actually backed by reserves.","Tether has claimed that each USDT token is backed on a one-to-one basis by U.S. dollars held in reserve. ","However, the lack of a transparent audit or regulatory oversight has fueled skepticism and led to accusations that Tether does not have sufficient reserves to fully back all the USDT in circulation."],"entity":[{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$88.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bloomberg Businessweek","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitfinex","Tether"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
