As soon as the victim responds, they ask them to continue the conversation via the WhatsApp messaging platform.","\u201CThe people forced to perpetrate these scams have a guide and a script, where if your victim is divorced say this, or a single mom say this,\u201D Erin West, deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County in Northern California, was quoted as saying.","West said there are \u201Chorrifying stories\u201D of victims that have fallen victim to this scam, which range from young women early in their careers, to senior citizens and even to people working in the financial services industry. ","In the report, Courtney Nolan, a divorced mother of three daughters, was presented as one of the victims who lost more than USD 5m in such a scam. Nolan said everything started with a direct Twitter message from a \u201Ccrypto enthusiast,\u201D who promised to mentor her on how to make reliable profits using major crypto trading platform XTB.com.","The scammer had Nolan create an account on the xtb-market[.]com, a duplicate of the original website that was made to be confusingly similar to XTB\u2019s official platform. The site promoted different investment packages, including a \u201Cstarter plan\u201D that asked for a USD 5,250 up-front payment in return for over 15% return.","Per the report, she initially made small investments and generated hefty returns. Nolan said she was even able to withdraw amounts ranging from USD 10,000 to USD 30,000 on several occasions. ","However, after investing more than USD 4.5m, she found her account frozen. Nolan then received a tax statement saying she owed nearly USD 500,000 in taxes before she could reactivate her account or access her funds. After paying the \u201Ctax bill,\u201D her mentor and the entire website disappeared.","In general, a pig butchering scam has four elements. These include social media or dating apps, WhatsApp, no video (scammers will come up with all kinds of excuses not to do a video call), and investment chit-chat, KrebsonSecurity\u2019s report said. ","As previously reported, romance scams have seen a steep rise over the past several years. In May 2021, a South Korean woman drugged a man she met on a smartphone chat app and stole USD 87,000 in crypto from his phone.\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Top 7 NFT Scams to Look Out For\n\u2013 7 DeFi Risks You Should be Aware of According to CoinShares\n\n\u2013 Crypto Exchange That Hosted a Scammer\u2019s Wallet Is \u2018Not Liable\u2019 For Victim\u2019s Losses, Court Rules\n\u2013 Police Investigate Ethereum, Bitcoin Mining \u2018Pool\u2019 Following \u2018Scam\u2019 Allegations\n\n\u2013 SIM Swaps, Other Crypto-related Crimes Set to Rise in South Korea, Says SK\n\u2013 MetaMask Aims to Help Crypto Scam & Phishing Victims Take Legal Action Against Fraudsters"],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Court Rules\n\u2013 Police Investigate Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Northern California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT Scams","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinShares\n\n\u2013 Crypto Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Courtney Nolan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Erin West","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Santa Clara County","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"MetaMask Aims to Help Crypto Scam & Phishing Victims Take Legal Action Against Fraudsters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nolan","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Crime","Cryptocurrency","Scam"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
