Data from CoinGecko shows the circulating supply approximately at 5.9 trillion while the network\u2019s total supply holds roughly at 6.9 trillion.","Due to their high circulating supply, cryptocurrencies such as Terra Luna Classic struggle to maintain an uptrend as supply and demand dynamics are heavily impacted. ","Consequently, it may take some time for LUNC to reach $1 again in the near future.","Buy LUNC Now"," "],"entity":[{"type":"Terra Luna Classic","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.00012","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.00013","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$0.0001","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.0002","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"58%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.000125","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1.612 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Terra Luna Classic Price","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.0001221","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["LUNC","Terra Luna Classic"],"authors":["John Isige"]}
