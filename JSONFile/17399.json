He was joined by 22 other Democratic members of Congress, including the well-known crypto-critic Brad Sherman and democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, better known as AOC.","The members of the Bitcoin and crypto community were quick to comment on the letter via Twitter, pointing out several false and misleading statements in it.","Among the most outspoken critics was Kraken\u2019s Jesse Powell, who said that he thinks he knows \u201Cwho paid for this garbage,\u201D while adding \u201CI can only conclude malice because I know they\u2019re not this dumb.\u201D","Kraken\u2019s CEO said of the comparison between PoW and PoS that,","\u201CGame isn\u2019t zero-sum. Energy is fungible. Some things cost more energy because they\u2019re better. My laptop sucks more juice than my calculator for a reason. Both are good and can co-exist. They are not interchangeable.\u201D ","Similarly, Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics and General Partner at Castle Island Ventures, argued that the letter was full of false statements.","\u201C[E]verything in your letter is wrong. Literally, almost every single claim,\u201D he said in a tweet to Congressman Huffman, before adding that the letter is based on \u201Cpropaganda that your staff is too thick to see through.\u201D","Lastly, the popular Twitter user Adam O of Bitcoin mining equipment supplier Upstream Data also commented, saying that he and many other miners \u201Care risking their capital in order to mitigate emissions.\u201D","\u201CYou should maybe do more research,\u201D the popular Bitcoin miner suggested.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 After Mozilla Abandoned PoW Cryptos Citing Energy Concerns, Wikipedia May Follow\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining CO2 Footprint Is Below 0.08% Of Global Total\n\n\u2013 Misleading Memo for US House Hearing on Bitcoin & Ethereum Mining Includes \u2018Basic Errors\u2019 \n\u2013 Proof-of-Hypocrisy: Securities Regulator Calls for Bitcoin Mining Ban in EU, Promotes PoS\n\n\u2013 A Closer Look at the Environmental Impact of Bitcoin Mining\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Energy Use \u2018Inconsequential,\u2019 \u2018Rapidly Becoming More Efficient\u2019 \u2013 Saylor\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Miners Must Take Note as Davos Chiefs Say \u2018Nobody Can Hide\u2019 from ESG Standards\n\u2013 Bitcoin Miners Adapt Fast As EU Mulls \u2018Climate-Friendly Cryptoassets\u2019\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Mining in 2022: New Locations, Technologies, and Bigger Players\n\u2013 How Bitcoin Mining Might Help Nations With Domestic Energy Production"],"entity":[{"type":"Bigger Players\n\u2013 How Bitcoin Mining Might Help Nations With Domestic Energy Production","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Environmental Impact of Bitcoin Mining\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Energy Use \u2018Inconsequential","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"General Partner","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Technologies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Castle Island Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Huffman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"99.99 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Cortez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AOC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mozilla Abandoned PoW Cryptos Citing Energy Concerns","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wikipedia May Follow","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jared Huffman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brad Sherman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Greece","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"House of Representatives\u2019 Natural Resources Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin & Crypto Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alexandria Ocasio","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jesse Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Upstream Data","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nic Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Saylor\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Miners Must Take Note as Davos Chiefs Say \u2018Nobody","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ESG Standards\n\u2013 Bitcoin Miners Adapt Fast As EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.08%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US House Hearing on Bitcoin & Ethereum Mining","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Community","Ecology","Kraken","Mining","Politics","Proof-of-stake","Proof-of-work","USA"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
