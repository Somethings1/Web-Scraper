On March 4, 24-hour Worldcoin trading surpassed Bitcoin transaction volumes \u201Cby nearly 2 billion won [over $1.5 million].\u201D","Authorities believe that at least 50,000 South Koreans hold WLD tokens. However, the coin has reportedly \u201Cgained great popularity among crypto investors\u201D in recent weeks.","The media report noted that as of 6:30 am UTC on March 7, 24-hour WLD trading volumes on Bithumb hit the $107.3 million mark. These figures were only surpassed by two other tokens: Bitcoin and Dogecoin.","Bithumb has \u201Cbenefited\u201D from listing the coin, unlike its closest rival Upbit \u2013 which once dominated the market in almost every trading pair.","On March 7, Spanish regulators ordered the Sam Altman-orchestrated Worldcoin project to halt operations in the nation.","This has likely sparked more trading fervor on Bithumb. At the time of writing, WLD transaction volumes on the platform were higher than all but SHIB and BTC.","The media outlet wrote:","\u201CThis is all good news for Bithumb. Typically, cryptoasset exchanges make money from commissions generated from trading. In other words, the more active WLD traders are, the more profit Bithumb can make.\u201D","WLD holders seem confident that despite the Worldcoin controversy in South Korea, their investments are safe for the time being.","The report noted that \u201Ceven if\u201D the regulator rules that the Worldcoin project \u201Cviolates personal information protection protocols,\u201D the \u201Cindustry consensus is that delisting is still a long way off.\u201D","Worldcoin officials have \u201Ctemporarily suspended iris scanning in South Korea\u201D until at least March 20.","Bithumb appears resolute on the matter. A spokesperson told the outlet that the exchange was \u201Cfollowing the deliberations of the Personal Information Protection Committee.\u201D","The Bithumb spokesperson said that it was \u201Cstill too early to discuss Worldcoin\u201D delisting-related matters.","However, the exchange conceded that if the committee were to rule \u201Cin the negative\u201D against the project, a body named DAXA would make delisting-related decisions.","Spain blocks Sam Altman\u2019s eyeball-scanning venture Worldcoin https:\/\/t.co\/THiU9YX0QC","\u2014 Financial Times (@FT) March 6, 2024","","DAXA, short for the Digital Asset Exchange Association, is a self-regulating body that comprises the nation\u2019s five licensed, KRW-trading crypto exchanges.
