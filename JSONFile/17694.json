The project resumed operations after a thorough investigation.","2️\u20E3 Radiant Capital","Loss: $4.5M\nWhat Happened: Exploiters took advantage of an empty market exploit.","More details: https:\/\/t.co\/uuMdCVZQqk","\u2014 Quantstamp (@Quantstamp) January 30, 2024","","Gamma Strategies, another affected platform, fell victim to a flash loan attack on January 4, shortly after the Radiant Capital incident.","The attack exploited a code bug, enabling the hackers to siphon $6.1 million from Gamma\u2019s public-facing vaults.","In response, Gamma temporarily suspended deposits and closed the vulnerability to mitigate further damage.","Furthermore, Wise Lending, a Web3 lending app, encountered a flash loan attack on January 12, resulting in a loss of at least $460,000.","The exploit involved manipulating the price oracle used by Wise Lending and marked the second attack on the protocol in six months. Approximately 170 Ether was drained from the platform.","On January 16, Socket, a multichain protocol, suffered a security breach due to a vulnerability in user verification input, allowing hackers to steal nearly 2,000 ETH, valued at over $4 million.","However, Socket managed to recover 1,032 ETH (equivalent to approximately $2.3 million) and reimbursed all affected users as part of its strategy to restore user funds.","Goledo Finance faced a security breach similar to Gamma Strategies\u2019 exploit on January 28, involving a flash loan attack that resulted in a theft of $1.7 million.","The platform is still negotiating with the perpetrator, and Goledo has announced a bounty to return the funds.","Goledo has frozen the hacker\u2019s accounts on centralized exchanges and is assessing the extent of the loss to develop a recovery strategy. It has also informed local law enforcement about the situation.","To address the losses suffered by its users, the Goledo Team has initiated a compensation process for asset recovery.","The project has provided users with a Google form to submit their claims.","The incidents highlighted by Quantstamp\u2019s report serve as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by the Web3 ecosystem regarding security and the need for continuous vigilance in safeguarding user funds.","It is worth noting that 2023 saw a slight decline in hacking incidents targeting the cryptocurrency industry despite losing around $2 billion to bad actors. ","According to a recent report from De.FI, a prominent Web3 security firm known for its REKT database, hackers managed to pilfer $2 billion in digital assets throughout the year.","While that amount is still alarming, it marks the first decrease in crypto hacking incidents since 2021."],"entity":[{"type":"Goledo Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 30, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$6.1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$38.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 4","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 16","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Goledo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goledo Team","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4.5","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"the first month of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wise Lending","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gamma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Radiant Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$460,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Crypto hack","crypto scam"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
