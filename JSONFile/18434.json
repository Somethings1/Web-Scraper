Rather, Garlinghouse noted that a Ripple stablecoin would act as a complementary product.","Either way, XRP investors don\u2019t seem too fussed by the news.","The dominant theme for XRP is still the SEC\u2019s battle to classify it as a security issued by Ripple.","After some legal wins for Ripple in 2023 that momentarily boosted XRP, momentum has stagnated this year.","But long-term price predictions are looking bullish.","A long-term assessment of the XRP price suggests it has formed a pennant structure in the last four years.","A downside breakout could trigger a drop back toward 2022 lows under $0.30. However, the upside price chance seems greater in a bullish market environment.","A break to the north of the pennant structure could see the XRP price quickly retest its 2021 highs around $2. That could mean 4x gains for XRP.","While not impossible, reaching a $100 token price during the current bull market seems far-fetched.","That would require a 170x rally, taking XRP\u2019s market cap to above $5.5 trillion\u2014more than four times Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap.","And XRP isn\u2019t even close to the current levels of adoption of Bitcoin or as strong of an adoption outlook as BTC.","Investors looking at altcoins might want to consider an alternative high-risk-reward investment strategy. Presale investing.","Analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market looking for potential gems.","One potential market leader they like the look of is a first-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR\/AR project, 5thScape, which has now raised nearly $4 million in its presale.","5thScape is pitching itself as the world\u2019s first VR\/AR mixed-reality platform to break boundaries by integrating crypto tokenization to provide a superior reward experience.","The project runs on the Ethereum network and will use the Skale Network Layer 2 technology to enable the scaling necessary for gaming and other virtual world activities.","Virtual and augmented reality also need great hardware to work well. So, the team at 5thScape will develop the VR Ultra headset and the Swiftscape VR chair to maximize comfort and ergonomics and deliver an immersive experience with precise motion tracking and intuitive controls.","The funds being raised in the presale will enable the project to complete the development and manufacture of its hardware and build the decentralized network infrastructure.","üöÄ Our presale has surged past stage 3!","üåê Join us now and delve into a world of virtual reality with our multi-utility token.","üéâ Don't miss out on being part of our vibrant community! #cryptocrash #cryptocrash #Wormhole #cryptocurrency #5thScape #Presale #4thstage üåü pic.twitter.com\/QeznEVAvFJ","\u2014 5th Scape (@5th_scape) April 4, 2024","","Priced at $0.00285, a steep discount versus the token\u2019s planned launch price of $0.01, investors who get involved now can lock in paper gains of 250%.","Given its token supply of 5.1 billion, investors who get in now are essentially buying into the project at a market cap of $52.1 million.","5thScape could easily become a major market leader in its VR\/AR niche, however. There is a good chance that it could one day become a $500 million market cap token.","That means investors who get in now could potentially lock in gains in the region of 1,000%.","5thScape was audited by¬†Coinsult, and no major issues were¬†found with its code.
