If issued, retail CBDCs can be expected to complement and coexist with other domestic payment methods.\u201D","The report noted that certain countries including India, the United Kingdom, and the European Union Nations have rolled out plans to explore the sector in order to bridge the financial gap among the unbanked worldwide. ","Despite the increase in the adoption of digital assets leading to big institutional investors and countries drafting regulatory frameworks, the survey noted that stablecoins and other virtual currencies are not used for many transactions outside the crypto market. ","The survey also confirmed previous analyst statements that cross-border remittances top the use of stablecoins outside the crypto ecosystem. ","In recent years, there has been a growing debate on the effect of CBDCs on traditional cryptocurrencies. Many opined that the growth of government-backed stablecoins defeats the idea behind cryptocurrencies. ","Digital asset creates a decentralized network giving users freedom from centralized control over their finance. ","However, this report states that Central Banks see value in digital assets to support fast payments and to link up more disadvantaged communities through the blockchain.","Retail CBDCs are key in driving a sustainable adoption of digital assets taking into consideration low-income earners and small-scale businesses.","Last month, the Bank of England released the report of the Rosalind tests highlighting a template around a two-tier retail CBDC model which solves the problem of centralization. ","The model would see Central Banks create the infrastructure while multiple financial institutions will create APIs with different functionality to allay fears of over-centralization. ","Recall that Ron DeSantis the Governor of Florida described CBDCs as a tool of surveillance by the government adding that his government would push back on \u201Cwoke ideology\u201D in the financial sector.","\u201Cprotect Floridians from the Biden administration\u2019s weaponization of the financial sector through a Central Bank Digital Currency.\u201D","Ron DeSantis wants laws to \"expressly forbid\" use of Central Bank Digital Currency in Florida, calls on other US states to do same\n\n\"Cash is king.
