Crypto Expert Tweets $1 Price Target, New Meme Coin WienerAI Raises $1.4 Million","category":["Industry Talk "],"content":["A top crypto influencer on X believes the popular Solana meme coin DogWifHat ($WIF) could tumble all the way down to a dollar from its current price of $3.17. ","In a recent tweet, Bluntz Capital (@Bluntz_Capital) cautioned, \u201Cprice action on this bounce over the last 3 weeks has been slow, overlapping, and corrective looking.\u201D","Bluntz further argues that WIF\u2019s current gains could be a brief wobble before the token crashes and bottoms out at a dollar. ","i thought the abc might be done on $WIF, but since that wick into $1.8 the ensuing price action on this bounce over the last 3 weeks has been slow, overlapping, and corrective looking.","am now leaning towards this move up being the (B) or (x) wave and a C wave down to $1 still\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/p5HhwIZz0t pic.twitter.com\/bHFmNGY4NT","\u2014 Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) May 7, 2024","","Since Bluntz joined the ByBit copy trading platform a year ago, he has been ranked as one of the top influencers, meaning he has consistently made money for his followers.","Still, DogWifHat\u2019s current price performance does not reflect a decline.","WIF is up 12% in the last 24 hours and 15% in the last week. It\u2019s moving broadly in line with the rest of the market, where most leading projects are up today.","The project with the second largest gains among the top five meme coins by market capitalization is Pepe Coin.","PEPE rose 6.8% to change hands at $0.05862 as of this writing. It is also up 13% in the last seven days. ","Both meme coins outdid market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH). Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, grew 3.5% overnight to trade at $63,176, while Ethereum added 2.2% to hit $3,037.","Like the market leaders, WIF rallied throughout March. However, it diverged a little at the end when the meme coin continued rallying strongly and actually rose to set a new all-time high of $4.83 on March 31. Today\u2019s price represents a 34.2% decline since then. ","DogWifHat currently has a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 57. This has been climbing since midweek, indicating buying momentum. If it doesn\u2019t cool off, investors may well see the beginning of the correction described by Bluntz. ","Bluntz\u2019s prediction may prove to be prophetic for WIF holders in the mid-term. Should the currency rebound from a dollar, which he implies, then there will be no damage done. However, meme coins highlight the inherently volatile nature of crypto.","A new generation of meme coins is cropping up though which bring bundles of utility along with laughs.","One of the finest representatives of this new generation of coins is WienerAI. $WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield some potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.","How staking your $WAI feels.https:\/\/t.co\/g0LrikQz90 pic.twitter.com\/3VneRo9wTq","\u2014 WienerAI (@WienerDogAI) May 9, 2024","","The presale is not even a month old and it has already quietly taken in $1.4 million.","Touted as a \u201CRevolutionary AI Trading partner\u201D, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.","The WienerAI smart contract was audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms. Around 20% of $WAI\u2019s supply is for staking.
