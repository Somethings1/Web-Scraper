That means exaggerated gains on Ether\u2019s strong days, but pronounced losses during selloffs.","\u201CBecause the Fund seeks daily leveraged investment results, it is very different from most other exchange-traded funds,\u201D reads the fund\u2019s prospectus. \u201CIt is also riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage.\u201D","Defiance ETFs just filed for a 2x leveraged #ethereum futures ETF.

Defiance noted that its fund will lose money if Ether futures trade flat or even if they modestly rise over a period longer than a day.","\u201CThe Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios,\u201D the company wrote.","Earlier this week, Defiance also filed for its 2X Short MSTR ETF \u2013 a leveraged short play on the Bitcoin development company MicroStrategy, which investors say is a leveraged play on Bitcoin (BTC). Blockstream CEO Adam Back blasted the ETF as a \u201Cterrible product\u201D that would get investors \u201Crekt.\u201D","On Tuesday, ProShares followed Defiance with filings for its own 2X and -2X spot Ether ETFs.","The filing comes after the SEC approved Ether futures ETFs for public trading in October. Roughly a dozen asset managers flooded the SEC\u2019s mailbox with applications after the agency approved the first 2X Bitcoin futures ETF from Volatility Shares in late June.","That fund \u2013 which trades under the ticker BITX\u2014is up 91% year to date, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 55% gains.","The logic was that if the SEC was willing to approve such a risky product, it may finally be open to Ether futures ETFs \u2013 the second largest crypto which historically had higher beta than BTC.","Though the first Ether ETFs pulled mediocre volume next to their Bitcoin counterparts, their approval signaled a potential change in how the SEC might treat crypto ETFs going forward. Three months later, Bitcoin spot ETFs hit the market, pulling $12.3 billion in net inflows since going live.","Investors now wait for the SEC to approve the ETH spot ETFs, though experts doubt they\u2019ll be approved soon."],"entity":[{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"91%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Volatility Shares","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$12.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$ETHL","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"55%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"late June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin (BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Adam Back","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Defiance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Ethereum ETF"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
