However, \u201Ceven while accelerating its campaign of enforcement suits against digital asset \u2026 the Commission ignored that petition until forced to explain itself.\u201D","The filing reiterated that the SEC denied its petition and only provided a single sentence stating that it disagreed with the claim that the current regulatory landscape lacked workability.","Though the SEC has made digital asset a top priority of its operation, the exchange believed that the authority has adopted a hostile perspective and pursued more aggressive enforcement tactics.","The document listed that the company is suing the SEC to determine two major issues.","The first statement of the issue is \u201Cwhether the Commission\u2019s refusal to engage in rulemaking regarding digital assets violates the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201D","The second issue is \u201Cwhether the Commission\u2019s failure to provide a reasoned explanation for its denial of Coinbase\u2019s rulemaking petition is arbitrary and capricious.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 11","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","SEC","United States"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
