Ranked first on Cryptonews, Bitcoin boasts a market cap of $1.21 trillion, with a circulating supply of 19,698,325 BTC and a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC.","The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF market has seen a significant $66 million inflow, marking a reversal from the outflow trend observed over the past two days. This surge is led by Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, highlighting renewed investor interest in cryptocurrency-backed exchange-traded funds. Additionally, this influx coincides with a recovery in Bitcoin\u2019s price.","Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant turnaround, with a $66 million net inflow after two days of outflows, according to Farside Investors. Leading this recovery is Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, which attracted $38.6 million in inflows, followed by Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB with $20.3 million.","This influx demonstrates renewed trader confidence in Bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge past the $63,000 mark. The rise in inflows also suggests a growing appetite for cryptocurrency investments amid overall market volatility.","Key Points:","Over the last 30 trading days, the ten Bitcoin ETFs experienced a net outflow of $297 million, with outflows on 17 of those days.

This level is crucial as it may determine the next major price movement. The symmetrical triangle pattern around this pivot point indicates potential volatility, suggesting that Bitcoin could break out in either direction.","On the downside, immediate support is found at $60,185. Should Bitcoin break below this level, it could target the next support levels at $58,550 and $56,645, indicating areas where buyers might step in to halt further declines.","The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47, indicating neutral momentum in the market. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $61,975, which currently exerts slight downward pressure on the price.","Conclusion: Bitcoin remains cautiously bullish above the $61,450 pivot point. If it breaks below this level, it could lead to a sharp decline towards $60,185, $58,550, and possibly $56,645.","Conversely, a breakout above $63,250 could drive the price towards $65,500 and $67,222.
