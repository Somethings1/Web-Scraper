Watch this space. #slothana #memecoin","\u2014 Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) April 8, 2024","","Lastly, it should be remembered that the past few months have been massive for SOL-based meme tokens (e.g. DogWifHat), with many rocketing up the charts.","The same could happen with SLOTH, at least when judging by the popularity of its sale.","Visit Slothana Now",""],"entity":[{"type":"$SLOTH","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1,400%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"SOL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 10, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"740%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Slothana","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$200","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$259","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.9 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Slothana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$0.019393","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$170.92","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Price Prediction","SOL","Solana"],"authors":["Simon Chandler"]}
