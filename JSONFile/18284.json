Before, the central bank had been allowing its balance sheet to shrink by $60 billion per month.","That reduction was a little larger than some investors appeared to anticipate and could explain the dovish market reaction to the initial policy announcement.","Bitcoin briefly pushed all the way to the mid-$59,000s, and US stocks pumped, though these moves quickly reversed.","Currently, Bitcoin is trading hands roughly in line with where it was before the Fed\u2019s announcement.","As expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted recent higher-than-expected inflation data readings so far this year.","POWELL: INFLATION DATA RECEIVED THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED","\u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) May 1, 2024","","He commented that gaining confidence to cut interest rates will take longer than expected.","POWELL: GAINING CONFIDENCE TO CUT WILL TAKE LONGER THAN THOUGHT","\u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) May 1, 2024","","According to CME data, the money market-implied odds that the Fed will have cut interest rates by 25 bps by September rose to 54% from 46% one day ago.","Meanwhile, the probability of no rate cuts this year dropped to 16% from 27% one day ago.","Ultimately, the market interpreted the Fed meeting as slightly more dovish than expected, explaining the Bitcoin price bounce from lows.","While Bitcoin may have recovered from earlier session lows, recent technical developments suggest more downside is coming.","Prior to Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting, Bitcoin had dropped nearly 5% from just below $61,000.","That drop came after it fell 5% from near $65,000 on Tuesday.","The decrease from earlier weekly highs comes as US economic data points to sticky inflation pressures and accelerated ETF outflows.","According to data presented by The Block, US Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for five days straight.","Importantly, Wednesday\u2019s dip saw Bitcoin break to the south of its two-month $60,000-$74,000ish range.","The next major level of support for Bitcoin isn\u2019t until the mid-February highs at $53,000.","Many analysts are now predicting that BTC will hit the low $50,000s.","Bitcoin will drop 13% to $50,000 after falling below a key support level as macro drivers slow, Standard Chartered says\nBitcoin has fallen past the ETF purchase price of around $58,000, putting over half of ETF positions underwater, Standard Chartered wrote.","\u2014 Ajay Bagga (@Ajay_Bagga) May 1, 2024","","A few analysts mentioned that the average entry price of US Bitcoin ETF buyers at $57,300 is important to watch.","\u201CThere might have been lots of \u2018TradFi\u2019 tourists in crypto pushing longs into the halving,\u201D 10x CEO Markus Thielen wrote. Â \u201CThis time is now over. We expect more unwinding as\u2026 Bitcoin trades below $57,300. This will likely lower prices to\u2026 a -25% to -29% correction from the $73,000 top. That explains our price target of $52,000\/$55,000 during the last three weeks.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"$59,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"54%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$50,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Walter Bloomberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ajay Bagga","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Markus Thielen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"-25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"-29%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2019s Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"13%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"27%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$65,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$25 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$57,300","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$57,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 1, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$73,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"5.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$74,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$53,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$58,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jerome Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$61,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$52,000\/$55,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$60 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Standard Chartered","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin Price","btc"],"authors":["Joel Frank"]}
