This movement comes amidst a broader uptick in the cryptocurrency market, where peers like Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Solana, and Litecoin also experienced gains.","Overall, the global crypto market cap escalated to $2 trillion, reflecting an over 2% increase within 24 hours. This suggests bullish Bitcoin price predictions, particularly in light of recent economic cues from the Federal Reserve indicating a pause in interest rate hikes.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s recent announcement indicated no further interest rate hikes, impacting financial markets significantly. This policy shift has softened the US dollar\u2019s stance, which in turn has bolstered Bitcoin prices. Although immediate rate cuts aren\u2019t on the table, the possibility remains open for future adjustments, further influencing market dynamics.","This economic backdrop sets the stage for potential shifts in investor strategy across both currency and crypto markets.","The M2 Money Supply, which includes all cash and short-term bank deposits, has shown positive growth year-over-year as of May 1, the first such increase since November 2022. This change suggests a surge in liquidity within the U.S. economy, typically prompting investors to consider assets like Bitcoin that historically perform well during inflationary periods.","ðŸš¨M2 Money Supply has flipped positive. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com\/KKl8rLhoaT","\u2014 Thomas | heyapollo.com (@thomas_fahrer) May 3, 2024","","This shift in the M2 Money Supply has not only reinforced Bitcoin\u2019s stability but also invigorated the market with a wave of optimistic price predictions. As liquidity increases and more traders look to hedge against inflation, Bitcoin\u2019s market value is expected to see a bullish trend.","Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, forecasts a steady increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $70,000, signalling optimism for the cryptocurrency\u2019s future. He suggests that Bitcoin might have found its local bottom, predicting that it will stabilize between $60,000 and $70,000 until August. Hayes links recent market dynamics to various factors:","Tweet of the Day.","Arthur Hayes, co-founder of #BitMEX, predicts that BitcoinðŸ’° has hit a local bottom and will gradually rise over the next few months.#btc $btc #eth #eth @CryptoHayes pic.twitter.com\/DAbJt00cEJ","\u2014 CRYPTO WISDOM with NEEL (@cryptowisdom7) May 3, 2024","","Supporting Hayes\u2019 outlook, industry experts like Jeff Ross from Vailshire Capital Management and analysts at MatrixPort also see the potential for a bullish phase, especially following Bitcoin\u2019s typical post-halving sideways movement.","","Bitcoin\u2019s pivot point stands around $59,570. A break above this level could signal a shift towards a more bullish bias, potentially pushing prices towards immediate resistance at $61,700. Further escalations could see BTC targeting higher resistance levels at $64,650 and $67,065.","Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to sustain above $59,570, it could face downward pressure, with initial support placed at $56,625.","Subsequent supports are observed at $55,055 and $53,000, which could play critical roles in cushioning any further declines.","Technical indicators like the RSI at 48 suggest a neutral market sentiment, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $61,321 provides a near-term benchmark.","","","","99Bitcoins, a leader in digital education, is transforming the way users learn about cryptocurrency through its \u2018learn-to-earn\u2019 platform.
