The catalyst of this positive price action is due to the proposal to deploy a 1.2% token burn on every LUNC transaction which is why the price has soared. ","The market capital for LUNC now sits at $2.5 billion and there is no doubt that the bulls will be chasing the $3 billion mark.","One of the most popular crypto Twitter traders @follis_ discovered #LUNAClassic was trending last week as the price had increased over 200% from the June lows. ","Terra Luna Classic heavily relies on its community which has recently been adding massive value to the network (similar to a meme coin). ","Looking at Binance\u2019s LUNC\/BUSD spot trading pair the 2022 low was on the 9th June at $0.000041. This was the golden opportunity to realize over 1,000% gains if you bought that particular low. ","It leads you to wonder how much higher can Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) really go from here, we have already seen a whopping 10x during a crypto bear market. As the price rises the upside potential reduces and the risk gets higher for new holders. ","Unfortunately, many retail investors with lack of trading experience are expecting the price to rocket to $1. This is technically not possible as the market capital would have to exceed $6 trillion. This is over six times the total crypto market capital valuation.","Could 1.2% transaction burns and Twitter trends really accommodate such an increase in price? Probably not. ","Tamadoge is selling out it\u2019s presale fast and now has over 53,000 Twitter followers @Tamadogecoin.
