It is the name for a spamming attack that could cause an \u201Cexponential increase in [the computer] resource requirements [\u2026] that would exceed the capacities of the extant Monero infrastructure on the scale of hours,\u201D according to Dr Mitchell Krawiec-Thayer, founder of Noncesense Research Lab. Other changes include increased ASIC resistance and a dummy encrypted payment ID that is added to each transaction to make them more homogeneous.","According to the project\u2019s official Twitter profile, the hard fork was successfully completed on March 9th, and the Monero team reminded their users to be patient: \u201CParticipants of the Monero ecosystem, please be reminded of significantly slower block times. They will normalize within the next 24-48 hours,\u201D they wrote.","A big bang attack could be catastrophic for the whole network. Currently, the block size of XMR is set at the median of the past 100 blocks, with a block time of two minutes. An increased amount of stress \u2013 like spam \u2013 could increase the block size exponentially (up to 10 TB, according to Thayer) which could shove out existing network nodes as they wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with this increase. The upgrade curbs runaway growth, while still allowing substantial spikes in block weight.","ASIC resistance makes up a big part of the coin\u2019s protocol upgrade, slightly changing their Proof of Work mechanism called Cryptonight-R. This decision comes after reports that the network has been overrun by ASIC miners again, posing the risk of centralization and making it more vulnerable in the face of potential attacks. Miners who wish to continue mining XMR are required to update their software per the directions provided by the team.","Another aspect of the upgrade are dummy encrypted payment IDs. This is an extra layer of data that serves to keep analytics firms from determining anything about XMR payments, including the source and destination of the transaction, by making it harder to extrapolate this data.","There are other updates in the hard fork that are smaller and more technical, but the aforementioned three make the biggest difference to the average user."],"entity":[{"type":"March 9th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cryptonight","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Noncesense Research Lab","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"48 hours","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mitchell Krawiec","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ASIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monero","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"XMR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"R","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thayer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Hard fork","Mining","Monero","Privacy"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
