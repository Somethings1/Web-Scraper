We are witnessing the birth of a new industry during the worst financial crisis of our lifetime.

It probably will take a few months or a couple of years.\u201D ","According to the Binance boss, USD 20,000 is today thought of as \u201Cvery low,\u201D although as recently as in 2018 and 2019 people \u201Cwould be very happy\u201D with such a price.","\u201CIf you look at the bottom [of bitcoin], right now it\u2019s higher than the last peak. So, whether normal or not, I think with the industry still definitely growing, fluctuations in price is normal,\u201D Zhao said.","Lastly, Max Raskin, an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law and director of research at Qvidtvm Inc, said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that reports of Bitcoin\u2019s death \u201Chave been exaggerated.\u201D","\u201CFor those who\u2019ve followed bitcoin since the beginning, the fall from [USD] 64,000 to [USD] 20,000 is simply another of bitcoin\u2019s \u2018many deaths\u2019,\u201D Raskin wrote. ","He was referring to the Bitcoin Obituaries page by 99 Bitcoins, which keeps track of how many times the crypto has been declared \u201Cdead\u201D by critics.","\u201CWith millions of dollars in speculation in nonfungible tokens [NFTs], initial coin offerings and obvious get-rich-quick schemes, it\u2019s easy to forget that bitcoin wasn\u2019t created by people looking to get rich,\u201D Raskin wrote.","Instead, Bitcoin was created by the pseudonymous programmer Satoshi Nakamoto, \u201Cwho wanted a money not controlled by government-run central banks,\u201D he said.","Raskin added that critics can rest assured that Bitcoin \u201Cisn\u2019t going away because the ideology underlying it isn\u2019t going away.\u201D","\u201CWith the [US] Federal Reserve increasingly guiding monetary policy according to political concerns such as climate change and \u2018diversity,\u2019 the intensity of the desire for apolitical money can only grow,\u201D Raskin wrote.","At 11:36 UTC on Thursday, BTC is trading at USD 20,662, up 0.5% in a day and down 8.3% in a week. Per coingecko.com, it is down 70% from its all-time high of USD 69,044 seen in November 2021. ","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Move Lower Again as Analysts Search for Answers, Point to Risks to Economy\n\u2013 Bitcoin, Ethereum & Crypto Analysts Search for Bottom as Investors in \u2018Historically Meaningful Degree\u2019 of Pain\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model and Its Proponents Under Fire Again as Failure Becomes Obvious\n\u2013 \u2018The Reckoning\u2019 & \u2018The Best Time\u2019 to Enter Bitcoin Mining as Firms Diversify Amid Bear Market\n\n\u2013 US Fed to Blame for Downturn, Large Crypto Players Have Responsibility Toward Ecosystem \u2013 FTX CEO\n\u2013 SEC\u2019s Peirce Says Crypto\u2019s Lack of \u2018Bailout Mechanism\u2019 Is a Strength; FTX CEO as a \u2018White Knight\u2019"],"entity":[{"type":"8.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum & Crypto Analysts Search for Bottom","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Qvidtvm Inc","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u2013 Bitcoin & Crypto Move Lower Again as Analysts Search for Answers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"0.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Raskin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York University School of Law","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao (CZ)","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Max Raskin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Peirce Says Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Large Crypto Players Have Responsibility Toward Ecosystem \u2013 FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"With millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"[US] Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Time\u2019 to Enter Bitcoin Mining as Firms Diversify Amid Bear Market\n\n\u2013 US Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Changpeng Zhao","Forecast","Market","Michael Saylor","Regulation"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
