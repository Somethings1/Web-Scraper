I respect it all but our odds for Eth ETF approval in May remain a pessimistic 25% (I\u2019d go lower if I could tbh). There\u2019s 7 wks till deadline and radio silence from SEC = bleak.

Grewal, the commission\u2019s Director of its Enforcement Division, criticized the crypto sector for its \u201Csignificant non-compliance\u201D with regulation.","SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce, however, voiced rare dissent from within the agency over its enforcement approach \u2013 going so far as to say the SEC was \u201Cscaring people off.\u201D","It\u2019s unclear how this ideological divide within the federal agency will play out regarding the potential approval of spot ETH ETFs."],"entity":[{"type":"Bloomberg ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$862 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Enforcement Division","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Practicing Law Institute\u2019s SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gurbir S.
