And that\u2019s not the only risk.","There is almost no barrier to entry for someone to create their own token. As a result, scammers flock to the on-chain crypto markets in an attempt to siphon funds from unknowing investors.","They can do this in various ways. One way is to insert malicious code into the token\u2019s smart contract, creating unfair trading conditions.","Alternatively, the token might be a pump-and-dump scheme. This is where the team behind a token builds up artificial hype to create demand, cash in, and abandon ship.","One popular technique is for a token\u2019s issuer to watch the ETH in the token\u2019s liquidity pool rise as the token\u2019s price pumps, only to withdraw and make off with this ETH abruptly.","That\u2019s why many on-chain investors look for \u201Clocked liquidity,\u201D which prevents so-called \u201Crug pull\u201D attempts.","That being said, let\u2019s have a look at top crypto gainers today that traders will be monitoring on DEXTools.","","A just-launched meme coin named after Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk has seen a big pump.","https:\/\/twitter.com\/Elon0x69420\/status\/1783029246795129130","Elon (ELON) is up 381,000%, as per DEXTools, with its market cap last at $16.4 million, and over 3,250 holders.","The meme coin only has two concerning aspects to its smart-contract, as per DEXTools\u2019 security audit.","But it could still be a pump-and-dump or rug pull, given its $574,000 in liquidity isn\u2019t locked.","Another just launched coin called Boys Club (BOYSCLUB) is up 13,600% as per DEXTools.","Its market cap was last $650,000, with just over $80,000 in unlocked liquidity.","The token is closing in on 500 holders and has seen nearly $3 million in trading volumes so far.","That\u2019s not bad for a first day of trade. But traders should always do their due diligence before aping into a new coin. Remember, most are scams.","Just launched meme coin Vitalik (VITALIK), named after the creator of Ethereum, is up just over 6,000% on Wednesday.","https:\/\/twitter.com\/vitalik0x69409\/status\/1783112718687613096","That\u2019s according to DEXTools, which puts its market cap at $300,000 and liquidity at $60,000.","The token has just over 450 holders and has seen around $2.5 million in 24-hour trading volume.","Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.","An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.","A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales.","","The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects\/protocols at a discounted early price.","These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.","While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales\u2014unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision\u2014savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.","With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.","Here are 21 of the presale projects with the highest potential.","See the 21 Cryptocurrencies",""],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$3,100","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$2.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$80,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$574,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tesla CEO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"381,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"13,600%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$650,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"6,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$300,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$16.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$64,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["DEXTools","Meme coin","Shitcoin"],"authors":["Joel Frank"]}
