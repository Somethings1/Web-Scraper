Surpassing previous highs, this data indicates a notable shift towards long-term holding strategies among investors.","Defined by specific criteria, including balances exceeding 10 BTC, no outgoing transactions, and exclusion of exchange or miner-associated accounts, these BTC accumulation addresses suggest a strategic pivot towards long-term holding despite market fluctuations.","The surge in accumulation signals enduring confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential, positioning it for a re-accumulation phase in the coming months after halving.","Notably, crypto analyst \u2018Rekt Capital\u2019 proposes that Bitcoin\u2019s current correction phase may soon give way to a re-accumulation period post-halving. Historical patterns suggest that a BTC accumulation phase often leads to a period of price consolidation following halving events.","#BTC","3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving","1. Final Pre-Halving Retrace","Bitcoin has produced two -18% retraces prior to the Halving in the span of just over a month","In mid-March, BTC pulled back -18% before recovering to $70000 and now in mid-April BTC has retraced -18% again","This\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/2BKBQXpPOV","\u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 17, 2024","","Bitcoin\u2019s price typically remains range-bound for approximately five months post-halving, similar to what we observed in previous cycles. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could trade within the high $50k range until around October, reflecting a consolidation phase before potential upward momentum.","Bitcoin has shown resilience by trading slightly below $64,000, marking a marginal increase of 4.3% within the past 24 hours.","","Jason Pizzino, a renowned crypto analyst, has offered insights into Bitcoin\u2019s price movements as well, identifying key resistance levels at $67,000, $69,000, and $71,000. He emphasizes the importance of a BTC accumulation and consolidation above $67,000 for sustained bullish momentum.","However, Pizzino also warns of potential downside risks if Bitcoin fails to maintain support above the $59,000 to $60,000 range, potentially leading to a correction towards the low to mid $50,000 range or even lower.","Pizzino uses historical data to contextualize current market dynamics, drawing parallels to past halving events and aiding investor decision-making. His analysis echoes Rekt Capital\u2019s observations regarding the potential BTC accumulation and price fluctuations following halvings.","Recent data also indicates substantial capital outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, notably Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), contributing to the cryptocurrency\u2019s decline.","Bitcoin miners\u2019 continuous selling before and after the halving event exerts additional downward pressure on the market."],"entity":[{"type":"$59,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jason Pizzino","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$71,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$50,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$63,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"4.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ali Martinez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$69,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 22, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$67,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 18, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"-18%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"mid-April BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 17, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pizzino","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"The Bitcoin Halving","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.72 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$50k","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$70000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$64,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Bitcoin halving","btc"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
