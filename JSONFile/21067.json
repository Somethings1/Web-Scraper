This strategic timing, combined with bullish market sentiments, propelled WIF to recent popularity.","CoinGecko\u2019s statistics published Wednesday further showed that Ethereum trailed behind Solana with a global traffic share of 12.73%, while BNB Chain followed at 5.38%.","According to CoinShares, Solana ranks as the second-largest altcoin by assets held in funds, trailing only behind Ethereum. This indicates substantial demand from institutional investors and whales.","As the market continues to expand, this trend is expected to strengthen, especially with the anticipated Bitcoin halving and potential rate cuts, which could fuel a prolonged bull market.","Moreover, Solana has experienced significant growth in recent months. It has notably become a favored platform for NFTs and meme coins.","CoinDCX co-founder Neeraj Khandelwal said the Solana developer ecosystem has seen significant progress in various aspects throughout 2023.","This includes advancements in tooling, improved developer experience, enhanced content quality, and a wider range of available programming languages.

Solana has experienced significant growth, with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) witnessing remarkable increases in trading volume,\u201D Khandelwal said.","DefiLlama reports significant spikes in trading volume within Solana\u2019s DeFi sector, seen particularly between March 3 and March 6.","\u201CMoreover, investors have been locking substantial amounts of SOL into staking contracts, surpassing a total value of $42b,\u201D he said.","Solana traded at around $208 at the start of the week, marking its first rise above $200 in two years. Notably, the coin has surged by 75% since the start of the year and has jumped over 700% in the past 12 months.","Considering this momentum and Solana\u2019s strong fundamentals, experts anticipate its price to soar to $250 by the summer."],"entity":[{"type":"Neeraj Khandelwal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$208","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"12.73%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"5.38%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"700%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BONK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$42b","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinGecko","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$200","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CoinShares","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 3","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$250","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Khandelwal","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["SOL","Solana","Solana meme coins"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
