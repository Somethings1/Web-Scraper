Arthur Hayes, the founder of Maelstrom Fund, said that bitcoin\u2019s core value of decentralization could be at risk.","In a recent podcast with Blockworks, Hayes portrayed a future where dominant financial establishments could consolidate large amounts of bitcoin. \u201CLet\u2019s say Larry Fink and his [traditional finance] ilk come in and hoover up a large percentage of the freely traded bitcoin in circulation,\u201D he said, highlighting the possibility of bitcoin becoming concentrated in few hands.","On a global scale, more traditional finance institutions are embracing the opportunity to offer crypto custody and trading services (ETF). Including the Standard Charted-backed Zodia, the Swiss bank SGKB, and Deutsche Bank, banks representing centralization and even \u201Cagents of the state,\u201D according to Hayes, are potentially centralizing bitcoin.","Hayes pointed out that institutions like BlackRock, a key investor in mining operations, could influence the future of cryptos. \u201CIf the BlackRock ETF gets too big, it could actually kill bitcoin because it\u2019s just a bunch of immovable bitcoin that\u2019s just sitting there,\u201D he said.","\u201C[The asset managers] act on what the state tell them to do. [The asset managers] went and bough some bitcoin and they put it in a custodian and it sits there,\u201D Hayes explain. \u201CYou can\u2019t actually use the bitcoin. It\u2019s a financial asset. It\u2019s not the actual bitcoin itself.\u201D","Hayes concluded that the institutional custodians would just be \u201Clarge passive investors\u201D and in a way it may be great for bitcoin\u2019s price in fiat terms. However, there is no definite saying of whether the institutional pursuit of bitcoin control would lead to its eventual downfall.","\u201CAre we, you know, gaining a sugar high today to only engender a massive calamity in the future? I don\u2019t know.\u201D Hayes said.","On the contrary, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Charlie Munger just listed bitcoin\u2019s rise as \u201Crat poison\u201D and disruptive threat to traditional finance."],"entity":[{"type":"Deutsche Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Standard Charted","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Berkshire Hathaway","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Charlie Munger","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Larry Fink","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Arthur Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Blockworks","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Arthur Hayes","Bitcoin","ETF"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
