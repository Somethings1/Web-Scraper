Many merchants \u201Care interested in bitcoin and believe it presents a wide range of use cases, such as long term savings and diversifying their businesses\u2019 holdings,\u201D the company\u2019s press release says.","\u201CMany sellers have told us they want an easy way to access bitcoin and diversify their holdings, so we tapped into Block's ecosystem to deliver a solution for them. Bitcoin Conversions automates the process for sellers while still giving them flexibility and control over how they manage their bitcoin,\" Bitcoin Product Lead at Cash App Michael Rihani told CoinDesk in an email.","It also presents a potentially lucrative financial service for Block, depending on how many merchants sign up and how much capital is converted per day. At launch, the new service will charge a flat 1% conversion fee \u2013 lower than the 2.25% fee Cash App charges for most retail purchases of bitcoin \u2013 but still an extra 1% Block can earn on top of existing processing fees.","Cash App, one of the most popular ways to onboard users into the bitcoin economy, appears to be emerging as the hub of Block\u2019s Bitcoin-focused efforts. Last month, the company began shipping out pre-orders of its proprietary, non-custodial Bitkey bitcoin wallet, which is connected to Cash App to provide \u201Cseamless\u201D BTC purchases and transfers.","Block earned a total profit of $1.18 billion on its Cash App business last year, up 25% year over year, including non-bitcoin sales, while Square generated a gross profit of $828 million. The company held approximately 8,038 BTC (worth $531 million at today's prices) as of the end of December.","See also: Jack Dorsey's Block Inc.
