Most DeFi can be shut down by a centralized party, so it\u2019s just a decentralization theatre. And yet no one can undo a hack or exploit unless we add more centralization. So how is this better than what we have now?\u201D he asks.","However, a developer Eric Wall stressed that this kind of an argument is \u201Cthe cheap, boring fast-track to \u201C[Crypto Twitter] wokeness\u201D these days,\u201D because having an admin key is \u201Cnot identical to a centralized exchange unless that admin key allows you to confiscate individual user balances.\u201D","What Lee and Wall are referring to in their posts is the recent hack of tokenized margin trading and lending platform bZx. During this past weekend, the hacker or hackers helped themselves with some USD 350,000, or c. 2% of the platform\u2019s assets under management, with less than USD 8 in transaction fees, by using several DeFi protocols and exploiting the so-called \u201Cflash lending\u201D on the bZx\u2019s Fulcrum platform. For reference, the bZx protocol hit the mainnet in 2018, while Fulcrum is a lending and trading dapp (decentralized app) launched in June 2019.","According to DeFi Pulse, the seventh-largest DeFi platform on the Ethereum network by Total Value Locked (TVL), bZX, saw a USD 3.56 million drop on February 16 and a USD 1.9 million rise today so far, with an improvement of +12.9% in the past 24 hours. Currently, it has USD 16.7 million in TLV.","bZx confirmed the attack, but stated that the remaining funds are safe, and that \u201Cproviding a comprehensive accounting of the losses will require additional time,\u201D adding: \u201CThis was not a simple Uniswap (a protocol for automated token exchange on Ethereum) attack, and we do not use Uniswap as an oracle.\u201D They use Kyber instead. They also paused borrowing and trading on the system and deployed a contract upgrade they believe will provide additional security against these types of attacks, while they also promised to publish a compensation plan for the lenders.","Additionally, the company said that the attacker had left 600,000 of wBTC as a collateral, and that the team will use the admin key \u201Cto stream interest and exit liquidity to existing iETH holders,\u201D adding \u201CThis is an extremely difficult decision for us that we don\u2019t take lightly.\u201D","The existence of an admin key is something many in the community, and apparently Lee as well, find problematic.","DeFi Pulse, a DeFi market data provider, also tweeted that the community believes these to be the transactions in question and that this was \u201Ca complex single-transaction exploit utilizing a 10k ETH flash loan from dYdX, half placed into Compound and half into Fulcrum,\u201D explaining what might have happened.","However, Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on public blockchains, didn\u2019t find any given explanation plausible. He wondered \u201Chow a market sell caused a sufficient market impact to affect the index if the entire process took place within the confines of a single transaction\u2026 there\u2019s no time for a market impact to be felt,\u201D he argued.","That said, bZx updated their followers, saying that an official report will be out today, February 17, at midnight UTC.","This brings us back to Lee who, replying to people trying to convince him in the benefits of DeFi, stated that it doesn\u2019t work on any platform, and that work on it should continue, but that he doesn\u2019t believe DeFi will revolutionize finance. \u201CI don\u2019t think it will work in practice,\u201D he writes. \u201CTruly decentralized finance, that is. Complexity will always lead to bugs and exploits. And it will always be semi-centralized.\u201D","The TLV locked in DeFi has recently surpassed a major milestone and now stands at USD 1.09 billion.","Other reactions:","__",""],"entity":[{"type":"February 17","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 16","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Castle Island Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Charlie Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"midnight","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Eric Wall","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"oracle","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DeFi Pulse","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nic Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"+12.9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1.09 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Decentralization","DeFi","Hack","Security"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
