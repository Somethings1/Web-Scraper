We didn\u2019t know how to go ahead with business. We didn\u2019t know if we were still going to be afloat.\u201D ","The inability to access bank accounts forced the company to explore alternative ways to sustain its operations. ","Nigeria has witnessed significant cryptocurrency adoption, second only to India, driven by the population\u2019s desire to hedge against the weakening local currency. ","The Nigerian naira has depreciated by almost 49% this year, prompting residents to seek crypto assets as a store of value. ","As reported, a recent survey has revealed that Nigeria is the most crypto-savvy nation ahead of the United States and European countries.","Per the survey, Nigeria\u2019s crypto awareness stands at 99% as the country leads in digital asset knowledge and perceived investment drive.","The data showed that 99% were fully aware of cryptocurrencies while 70% understood the value, operations, and fundamentals of blockchain technology. ","Furthermore, it revealed that the majority of Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation in recent years after a poor performance of the naira coupled with double-digit inflation. "],"entity":[{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nigerian naira","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ogochukwu Umeokafor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"99%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Virtual Asset Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank of Nigeria","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"49%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"cryptocurrency exchange Yellow Card Financial","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nigeria","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"India","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Yellow Card","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Africa","Nigeria","Yellow Card"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
