In a later correction, CNBC wrote that a Walmart spokesperson has \u201Cconfirmed the press release is not authentic.\u201D","The source of the fake press release remains unknown.","The price of litecoin jumped from USD 174 to 237 on Coinbase immediately following the news, before later giving back almost all the gains. At 14:40 UTC, LTC was still up about 4% from before the pump started, trading at USD 181.60. ","Moreover, the fake news also appears to have had an impact on the broader crypto market, with both bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) rising at the time of the news, before a selloff started at around 13:45 UTC, the same time as LTC sold off.","Similarly, Walmart\u2019s stock price also opened up for the day in New York trading, where the opening of the stock market coincided with the release of the fake news at 13:30 UTC (09:30 ET). However, the stock quickly moved lower, and is currently trading at USD 145.5, 0.9% below its opening price.","__\nReactions:","Take a look at the journalism around it. Unchecked press release.
