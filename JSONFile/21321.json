Without the ability to manage our wealth, we lose control of our destiny and the chance to create better futures for our families,\u201D said Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter.Â  \u201CThis law ensures that everyone can secure not only their #Bitcoin but all their assets.\u201D","News of the state-wide legislation comes amid the federal government\u2019s crackdown on cryptocurrencies, particularly regarding self-custody wallets.","Last month, the Department of Justice arrested Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill on conspiracy to commit money laundering and supposedly operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.","Similarly, Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and sanctions violations.","U.S. authorities are especially concerned about the financing of illicit criminal and terrorist financing via the crypto mixers. Tornado Cash was accused of facilitating \u201Cmore than $1 billion in money laundering transactions\u201D for North Korean hackers Lazarus Group.","Meanwhile, the founders of Samourai Wallet are accused of executing \u201C$2 billion in unlawful transactions and facilitating more than $100 million in money laundering transactions from illegal dark web markets.\u201D","Pro-crypto proponents have been outraged over the federal charges, alleging that self-custody is necessary for those seeking to protect themselves from bad actors in the digital asset sector, however.","\u201CGiven the recent onslaught of attacks on self-custody, there could not be a more important time to send a message that the right to access and self-custody #Bitcoin and digital assets MUST be protected,\u201D Porter continued.","HB3594 will take effect on November 1 of this year. It is unclear whether its passage in Oklahoma will prompt other state legislatures to follow suit."],"entity":[{"type":"May 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"North Korean hackers Lazarus Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Keonne Rodriguez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dennis Porter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bill Coleman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Porter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"HB3594","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kevin Stitt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Samuel Brian Hill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"William Lonergan Hill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Roman Semenov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Oklahoma","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","tornado cash"],"authors":["Julia Smith"]}
