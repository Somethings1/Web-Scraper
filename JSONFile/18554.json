The company\u2019s sole owner and leader, Desmond Amey (42), who presented himself as a wealth creation specialist, had previously assured customers that their cryptocurrency investments were safe.","Despite Amey\u2019s assurances, customers allegedly lost money in their investments, according to a statement on Monday. This lack of positive returns raised red flags. And in July 2022, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stepped in.","The financial watchdog identified Amey Finance Academy as an unauthorized provider of financial services or products in the UK, warning against dealing with it.","The firm\u2019s founder Amey didn\u2019t return Cryptonews\u2019 request for comment by press time.","Established in Dec. 2018, Amey Finance Academy advertised itself on social media as \u201Can established and successful independent consultancy providing a plethora of financial services.\u201D The company also claimed to operate a leading education academy within the industry, the Insolvency Service said.","However, Amey made false assurances, guaranteeing one customer who later lost all their invested funds that their investment would not fall below 90%.","In WhatsApp messages investigators reviewed, Amey assured another customer that the investments were \u201C100 certy\u201D and urged them to \u201Ctrust me bro.\u201D Additionally, Amey Finance Academy promoted crypto schemes conducted by other firms such as HyperFund, which raised over $1.7b from investors globally.","Further, Amey posted a video on YouTube in Oct. 2023, suggesting that the office still maintained a presence at 1 Canada Square in Canary Wharf, London. However, he had actually been evicted earlier that year in January due to rent non-payment.","\u201CDesmond Amey used Amey Finance Academy to recklessly persuade individuals to invest in cryptocurrency schemes and mislead them about the risks of doing so,\u201D said Mark George, the Insolvency Service\u2019s chief investigator.","He also mentioned that the service couldn\u2019t determine the company\u2019s full activities, assets, liabilities. Nor could it ascertain the handling of Â£5m ($6.2m) from Oct. 2019 to March 2022 due to insufficient accounting records and lack of transparency.","\u201CThe public deserve protection from companies trading in an opaque and objectionable manner which is why we applied to have Amey Finance Academy shut down,\u201D George said.","Earlier this year, the UK\u2019s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) took down 43 websites suspected of crypto phishing scams. The NFIB\u2019s investigation uncovered a fake email address designed to trick Blockchain.com customers. This spoofed address aimed to exploit security weaknesses and steal cryptocurrency."],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1.7","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1 Canada Square in Canary Wharf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$6.2","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NFIB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"George","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dec. 2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Oct. 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mark George","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Desmond Amey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"London High Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Insolvency Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Amey Finance Academy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UK\u2019s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UK government\u2019s Insolvency Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Amey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Financial Conduct Authority (FCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Desmond Amey","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Amey Finance Academy Ltd","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Oct. 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bankruptcy","UK"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
