Apollo Global Management is one of the potential participants, they said.","The takeover is expected to be finalized by the end of this year, and it will be subject to the approval of Twitter\u2019s shareholders and relevant regulators.","Musk\u2019s bid to take over the platform for USD 54.20 a share means that Twitter could become one of the world\u2019s most valuable privately-owned companies. At the same time, the multi-billionaire claims that his main intention is to bolster free speech through the takeover, and not to enrich himself.","Twitter will always be free for casual users, but maybe a slight cost for commercial\/government users","The deal\u2019s importance for the crypto industry is emphasized by the fact that Twitter is a major venue for crypto-focused communication.","\u201CTwitter isn\u2019t a particularly valuable company relative to peers. It\u2019s valued at a market cap of [USD] 37.5 billion with 217 million daily active users, far behind most of its social media competitors,\u201D stated a recent newsletter by the crypto podcast Bankless. ","\u201CBut Twitter is a gateway to cultural significance. Unlike Facebook or Instagram where users add\/follow others, its open ecosystem design is akin to a public town square space where every voice can be heard. It\u2019s why it\u2019s been so effective for crypto,\u201D the newsletter said. ","Furthermore, Musk has today changed his profile picture on Twitter to a collage of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible tokens (NFTs). ","It seems that this particular image is a stock photo.  The Ape #5809, currently priced at ETH 85 (USD 243,430), sits in its center. This latest bid follows a much lower one of ETH 6.64. Notably, the high bid has been placed at 11:00 UTC today after days of inactivity. ","At 11:42 UTC, Apecoin (APE), launched by BAYC creator Yuga Labs, was up nearly 1% in a day and down 13.3% in a week, trading at USD 15.59. At one point today, the coin had jumped from USD 14.54 to USD 17.46, dropping to the current level soon after.  ","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Elon Musk NFT First to Enter Ukrainian Hall of Fame and You Can\u2019t Buy It\n\u2013 Elon\u2019s Twitter: bluesky Keeps Independence, Dorsey Praises Musk, Market Awaits Next Step\n\n\u2013 Crypto Community Welcomes Musk\u2019s Twitter Bid as Obstacles Emerge\n\u2013 Musk Not Joining Twitter\u2019s Board But Wants \u2018Significant Improvements\u2019, Teases DOGE Payments Integration\n\u2013 Elon Musk Won\u2019t Sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoins as Inflation Soars and Recession Risk Grows\n\n\u2013 Blockchain.com\u2019s IPO Might Happen This Year, Indian Exchange CoinDCX Doubles Valuation\n\u2013 Bitfury Is Said To Be Valued \u2018In Billions\u2019 as IPO Rumors Reemerge"],"entity":[{"type":"Apollo Global Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BAYC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yuga Labs","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Community Welcomes Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bored Ape Yacht Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"5809","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"13.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tesla CEO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Teases DOGE Payments Integration\n\u2013 Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk NFT First to Enter Ukrainian Hall of Fame","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Elon Musk","IPO","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Twitter"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
