The mark-to-market adjustment was a very favorable one given the big run higher in bitcoin prices.","The miner is sticking to its 2024 guidance of ramping up to 50 exahash per second (EH\/s) and sees additional growth in 2025.","Marathon's stock fell roughly 1.5% in post-market trading on Thursday. Shares have declined 26% this year while peer Riot Platforms (RIOT) has seen its stock price fall 40%.","Edited by Stephen Alpher.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Stephen Alpher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"34%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"FASB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Riot Platforms (RIOT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.02","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.26","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"26%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Garden City","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Marathon Digital","mara","Bitcoin Mining","Earnings"],"authors":["Aoyon Ashraf"]}
