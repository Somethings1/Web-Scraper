I agree that the analysis of whether a digital asset is offered or sold as a security is not static and does not strictly inherent to the instrument. A digital asset may be offered and sold initially as a security because it meets the definition of an investment contract, but that designation may change over time if the digital asset later is offered and sold in such a way that it will no longer meet that definition.","I agree with Director Hinman\u2019s explanation of how a digital asset transaction may no longer represent an investment contract if, for example, purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts. Under those circumstances, the digital asset may not represent an investment contract under the Howey framework.\u201D","The full letter can be found here.","Later, in a tweet, Brito added that \u201Cjust because the ether token today is not a security does not mean that the Ethereum ICO was not a violation. Typically, though, if SEC is not going to pursue an enforcement action (for whatever reason) they remain silent.\u201D","In the speech last year, Hinman said that \u201Cputting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.\u201D At the time, the SEC explained that \u201Cthis speech expresses the author\u2019s views and does not necessarily reflect those of the Commission, the Commissioners or other members of the staff.\u201D","Meanwhile, not everyone is convinced that the letter from Clayton is the confirmation the market is waiting for. Gabor Gurbacs, Director of Digital Asset Strategy at VanEck, an investment management firm, reacted:","___\nMarco Santori, President and Chief Legal Officer at Blockchain, a major crypto company, noted:","He went on further to explain that \u201CHinman can say stuff like that but for the Chairman to say it in a letter to Congress is another matter entirely. It would be construed as binding, and the SEC isn\u2019t trying to have that.\u201D","\u201COkay but is Ether a security? No, I don\u2019t think it is,\u201D Santori added.\n__","Meanwhile, popular economist and Bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester noted:","___","Ether price chart:",""],"entity":[{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jay Clayton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coin Center","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Clayton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jerry Brito","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hinman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Blockchain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Brito","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Director of Digital Asset Strategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Santori","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ted Budd","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Howey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June 2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marco Santori","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Regulation","SEC"],"authors":["Linas Kmieliauskas"]}
