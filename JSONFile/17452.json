The game\u2019s economy is driven by the Calvaria token, RIA, which is used to buy Calvaria NFT cards as well as for staking and governance within the Calvaria DAO.","In this guide, we\u2019ll cover everything investors need to know about Calvaria and explain how to buy Calvaria token (RIA) during the project\u2019s ongoing presale.","Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of everything investors need to know about Calvaria and the RIA token:","Visit Calvaria Presale","RIA is an ERC-20 token and the native token of Calvaria. It\u2019s one of the fastest growing crypto tokens of 2022 and plays a critical role in the Calvaria gaming ecosystem.","Investors and gamers interested in Calvaria can buy RIA tokens today through the project\u2019s crypto presale. Here\u2019s how to buy Calvaria token during the presale:","Investors must have a MetaMask or Trust crypto wallet in order to connect to Calvaria\u2019s presale platform. Both of these wallets support ERC-20 tokens including RIA, and both are free to download. Visit MetaMask\u2019s website to download MetaMask for iOS, Android, or Google Chrome.","Calvaria accepts payment for RIA tokens in Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (UDST). Investors can purchase either token through a centralized crypto exchange using fiat currency, then transfer the purchased coins to their crypto wallet.","Investors also have the option to bypass this step. Calvaria has partnered with Changelly to accept credit card payments for RIA. Changelly will convert credit card payments to Ethereum for a small fee. Investors must still have a crypto wallet even if they buy Calvaria token with a credit card.","Visit the Calvaria presale platform and click \u2018Connect Wallet.\u2019 Select the wallet downloaded in Step 1 and the presale platform will automatically connect to it.","Enter the amount of RIA to buy and choose whether to complete the purchase with ETH or USDT. Keep in mind the minimum investment is 1,000 RIA (approximately $10).","Calvaria will release purchased tokens at the end of the presale. At that time, return to the presale platform and re-connect a crypto wallet to claim the purchased RIA.","Visit Calvaria Presale","Calvaria: Duels of Eternity is a play-to-earn crypto game in which players build custom card decks and battle them against each other. Each card represents a unique character within the Calvaria universe, with its own powers and abilities. Players who win battles in Calvaria earn RIA tokens.","The team behind Calvaria has developed a rich game universe with fantastical characters. According to the game\u2019s mythology, Calvaria is a fight for the afterlife between 3 groups of rival creatures. Each of the characters represented by Calvaria cards is rendered in 3D and there are limited numbers of each character\u2019s cars.","Every playing card in Calvaria is an NFT, so players own their decks. They are free to buy and sell NFT cards in the Calvaria peer-to-peer marketplace, which offers a way for players to monetize their decks or put together a unique deck for a specific strategy.","Calvaria compares itself to crypto games like Gods Unchained, Spellfire, and Splinterlands. Several features set Calvaria apart, however, including:","The cryptocurrency RIA is the native token of Calvaria and is key to understanding how the game\u2019s play-to-earn mechanics function. RIA is an ERC-20 token, meaning it operates on the Ethereum blockchain and can be easily sent or received to any ERC-20-compatible crypto wallet.","First and foremost, RIA is distributed to players as a reward for winning battles in Calvaria. Players can earn RIA by defeating their opponents, exploring Calvaria in story mode, or by rising to the top of monthly tournaments.","Players who earn RIA (or buy it through the presale or, in the future, from a crypto exchange) can use it to buy NFT cards at the Calvaria marketplace. Buying cards enables them to strengthen their deck and potentially win more battles, thus earning them more RIA.","Alternatively, players can stake their RIA tokens. This locks up their RIA to validate actions in the Calvaria gaming universe. In return, players receive RIA token rewards\u2014essentially passive income. (Calvaria has not yet released details about its staking pools or rewards.)","Finally, RIA serves as a governance token. Players who stake a minimum amount of Calvaria will have voting rights within the Calvaria DAO, allowing them to have a say in the future development of this crypto project.","The RIA token is now available through a crypto presale. The presale will release 300 million tokens out of a total fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. An additional 250 million tokens will be locked to the RIA staking pools to be used as a reward for crypto staking.","Visit Calvaria Presale","Calvaria promises to be one of the most exciting new play-to-earn crypto games when it launches in 2023. On top of that, the RIA cryptocurrency could be set to explode following an initial coin offering (ICO).","Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the reasons investors should be interested in Calvaria.","Calvaria is a play-to-earn (P2E) crypto game, so there\u2019s money to be made by gamers who can build high-quality decks and develop a strong battle strategy. Battle winners in Calvaria earn RIA tokens, which can be traded for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Alternatively, winners can hold onto their RIA tokens and stake them to Calvaria to earn passive income.","Another way to use RIA winnings is to reinvest them in the game. Players can use RIA to buy more NFT cards in the Calvaria marketplace, expanding their strategy and increasing their chances of winning even more.","NFT cards in Calvaria are limited-edition, and investors in the presale have the best chance of getting strategically valuable cards when the project\u2019s first NFT drop happens.","Calvaria NFT cards also have value in and of themselves. As more players join the game, demand for rare and powerful NFT battle cards will increase. That will push up the price of these NFTs in the Calvaria marketplace, leading to a potential payday for investors who joined Calvaria early and got top cards during the first round of NFT drops.","Investors can also use RIA to purchase NFTs in the Calvaria marketplace and then hold them as they appreciate in value. For that strategy, it can make a lot of sense to buy RIA during the Calvaria presale, since these are the lowest prices that investors will ever have to pay for RIA tokens.","Calvaria also provides returns for investors through crypto staking of the RIA token. While the project\u2019s developers haven\u2019t yet announced staking tiers or rewards, Calvaria has committed to setting aside 250 million tokens \u2013 25% of the total supply \u2013 to reward investors who stake RIA.","RIA could become one of the best staking coins around. Staking enables early investors to earn passive income from their RIA and battle winners to compound their returns from playing Calvaria.","On top of that, users who stake a minimum amount of RIA will be given voting rights in the Calvaria DAO. That\u2019s important because voters can decide on things like what rewards to offer for staking. They can also make decisions about the future of Calvaria\u2019s development, which can help push up the price of RIA over the long-term.","Calvaria has significant advantages over similar play-to-earn games like Gods Unchained and Splinterlands. It offers mobile play, free entry, and much more impressive rewards mechanisms for players and investors.","","Over the long run, these advantages mean that many crypto gamers may join Calvaria, and traditional gamers who are new to P2E crypto games may give Calvaria a try. As more and more gamers join Calvaria, demand for RIA tokens will go up as the supply stays fixed. That supply-demand imbalance can push up the price of RIA, generating returns for early investors. In other words, Calvaria could be a long-term crypto investment worth considering.","Visit Calvaria Presale","Calvaria\u2019s native RIA token is currently available through a crypto presale. Anyone can buy RIA during the presale as long as they make a minimum purchase of 1,000 RIA (around $10).","This crypto launch will sell a total of 300 million RIA tokens, or 30% of the total supply. It is expected to raise $300,000 for the game\u2019s development and generate momentum ahead of an initial coin offering.","The presale is split into several stages, with the price of RIA increasing at each stage. Right now, in the presale\u2019s first stage, RIA has a price of $0.01.","The table below shows all the details investors need to know about the Calvaria presale:","Calvaria is a relatively new project and the RIA token is only in the first stage of its presale. So, it\u2019s hard to make predictions about where this new cryptocurrency might be a year or more from now.","That said, the RIA presale has been met with initial excitement. If the presale sells out, Calvaria could see the price of RIA jump sharply during an initial exchange offering. This is a pattern that many top penny cryptocurrencies have followed, although investors should remember that there is no guarantee RIA will follow the same path.","Calvaria is a new crypto game that lets players collect NFT battle cards and win RIA cryptocurrency as they play. RIA tokens can be used to buy additional NFTs in the Calvaria marketplace or staked to generate passive income for investors.","Calvaria has several advantages over similar P2E crypto games.
