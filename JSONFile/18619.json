The news should come as no surprise given the speculative nature of crypto in general and crypto launches in particular, amidst a risk-averse macro outlook and cooling enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETFs.","Still, since launching as a decentralized on-chain social network last August, the protocol has ratcheted some significant milestones before the turn of the year, including $1 million in 24-hour fees (surpassing Uniswap and Bitcoin), and taking in tens of millions in fees.","Unfortunately all the attention brought opportunists along too. Friend.tech was targeted by a spate of SIM swapping attacks and a massive data leak.","Still since launching yesterday the FRIEND token has found its home quickly within the $2.40 to $3.20 range. Although it\u2019s still early days yet, it looks like the holders who wanted to cash out at launch have done so. This means that FRIEND is likely to now track price movements in the wider market.","And those movements are looking optimistic after a recent bearish spell that sank the price of Bitcoin to under $60k last week. The world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency is back trading at $64,090, which is roughly the same price it was this time last week, but a gain of 3.4% from seven days ago.Â ","","Friend.tech has an intriguing premise and plenty of celebrities backing it, including the NBA\u2019s Grayson Allen, and crypto influencers Cobie and Gainzy and RookieXBT","However one presale that has quietly taken in $1.1 million so far offers a different kind of friendship. WienerAI ($WAI) is the brand new meme token andÂ AI companion that may yield some potentially eye-watering rallies on listing thanks to its core offering.","Touted as a \u201CRevolutionary AI Trading partner\u201D, WienerAI is a digital companion that gives his owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.Â ","The WienerAI smart contract wasÂ audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms.Â ","Pls don't miss out.","PRICE GOES UP IN ONE DAY!","The time is NOW ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ­ pic.twitter.com\/J0FyqI0hAX","\u2014 WienerAI (@WienerDogAI) May 6, 2024","","Around 20% of $WAI\u2019s supply is for staking.
