Bitcoin Cash\u2019s market cap, meanwhile, was last just above $13 billion.","While it has pulled back 40% from March\u2019s highs at $0.000045, SHIB is still 2.5x up on the year.","The catalyst was a sudden surge in meme coin risk appetite as Bitcoin hit fresh all-time highs a month ago.","Bitcoin (BTC) nearly hit $74,000 in March following January\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Needless to say, this launch has gone on to be the most successful ETF launch of all time.","While Bitcoin may be back at record highs, the Shiba Inu price still has a long way to go. It nearly hit $0.00009 in 2021 and is still down 70% compared to these levels.","So, SHIB could still be on course for 3x gains from here in this bull market\u2014or more, depending on whether meme coin mania can surpass its insane peak from 2021.","Either way, long-term Shiba Inu price bets are set to remain bullish.","$1 SHIB is possible, but only if the team decides to erase some zeros from the total supply.","At the current price of $0.000027, SHIB would need to be nearly 40,000x to get to $1.","That would involve its market cap reaching an impossible $640 trillion, which is probably more than the value of all assets on the planet summed.","A quick look at the SHIB chart suggests the Shiba Inu price is probably headed for a retest of mid-March lows in the $0.000024 area.","That is a strong support zone, with the 50DMA also coming into play.","If the Shiba Inu price can find strong support here, it could soon break its recent downtrend.","That could open the door to a quick retest of its recent highs in the $0.000045s.","Shiba Inu\u2019s already massive market cap means its potential to deliver big gains to investors is limited.","That\u2019s not the case with the new meme coin Dogecoin20.","Dogecoin20 is a rework of the meme coin Dogecoin beloved by Elon Musk that just launched in presale. It features the familiar Dogecoin brand but is based on Ethereum, and offers a staking option.","That means crypto coin presale investors can generate an impressive passive income, around 65%, per the project\u2019s dashboard. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the meme coin has already raised over $10 million.","Interested investors should move quickly to secure their tokens before the presale ends on doge day in 17 days. At a current price of $0.00022, investors can buy into the token at a possibly discounted valuation of under $30 million.","For a meme coin that could easily be 10x to above $300 million or 100x to above $3 billion, investors are rushing to get involved.","Visit Dogecoin20 Here","Cryptonews analyst Ari ranks Dogecoin20 as one of his top cryptos to buy right now.
