This strategy is aimed at mitigating potential security risks for the company.","Further, only a few team members are reportedly permitted to publicly acknowledge their association with Kraken. The remainder of the team is advised to maintain a lower profile as cybercriminals frequently target crypto exchange staff.","Percoco added that having security team members active on social media can expose the company to hacks. He also noted that hackers tend to target employees from TradFi backgrounds who change job titles on social media.","Confronting these risks, Kraken reportedly established a policy 5 years ago \u2014 if employees don\u2019t need social media for work, they should not have profiles on these platforms.","Now, less than 5% of Kraken\u2019s security team is publicly known \u2014 a crucial aspect of the exchange\u2019s security approach.","Kraken didn\u2019t return Cryptonews\u2019 request for comment by press time.","Kraken\u2019s move is not surprising as hacking continues to pose a major threat to crypto companies.

This can compromise a company\u2019s network and sensitive data can be stolen. Data can then be misused to breach compliance standards and reveal confidential information, putting employee safety at risk.","Kraken appears to be taking compliance measures seriously after a tough year for the crypto industry.","Last year, the exchange faced allegations of running without proper registration as a securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.","Co-founder Jesse Powell has stressed the need for self-regulation in the industry, as timely protection can be unreliable. He suggested that companies like Coinbase, Ripple, and Kraken remain susceptible to SEC scrutiny and that governments can use questionable operations to tighten crypto regulations."],"entity":[{"type":"Jan. 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.7","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$126m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.61","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.51","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.8","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"27.78%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jesse Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"54.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nick Percoco","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Financial News","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$674.9","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Hacks","Kraken","Security"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
