The halving is when miners\u2019 block rewards get halved, causing a supply squeeze in the issuance of new Bitcoin.","Historically, halvings have tended to drive the price higher, and this halving looks no different, with institutional demand for Bitcoin currently at an all-time high.","Ethereum fans are also pointing at a potential milestone on May 23. This is the SEC\u2019s first deadline to return a verdict on the latest round of applications for a spot Ethereum ETF. If Ethereum ETFs are approved, then institutional demand for Ethereum in the US could drive prices to new highs.","Over on the price chart we can see that Ethereum has charted a clear path upwards since the start of February, although with a current Relative Strength Index (RSI) almost at 70, there is heavy buying pressure.","Ethereum and Bitcoin may be where the safe money is at, but a small group of coins posted blistering triple-digit percentage seven-day gains recently: meme coins.","Viral marketing campaigns and the novelty factor typically drive meme coin prices, although two of the largest are now serious projects in the industry: Dogecoin (DOGE), which has a first-mover advantage and originality on its side, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Solana is branching out as a network and offering more utility,","One meme token that combines freshness with utility and offers more than laughs is SPONGE. it\u2019s the native token for an exciting new ecosystem.","GM #SPONGERS! ðŸ§½ðŸ§½ðŸ§½","Did someone say moon? ðŸš€","Trade $SPONGE on @dexscreener ðŸ‘‡https:\/\/t.co\/mRRzvNqdpm#MemeCoin #Crypto #Altcoins #Bullish #100x pic.twitter.com\/iVOCDTYMVz","\u2014 $SPONGE (@spongeoneth) March 8, 2024","","According to CoinGecko data, SPONGE is up nearly 100% in the last week and 143% in the last fortnight as it trades for $0.003209 at the time of writing.","SPONGE is an ERC-2o standard token on Ethereum. It recently upgradedÂ (and migrated) to a V2 on Polygon, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution.","The team also introduced a couple of key improvements with the upgrade, including a new staking model that offers a minimum yield of 40% APY.","This yield currently sits at around 490%, varying according to the number of stakes and tokens locked up.","SPONGE also powers an upcoming racing game where players compete against each other to earn SPONGE rewards.","Buy And Stake SPONGE On The Website",""],"entity":[{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"14.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.003209","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$72,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"9.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 23","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$SPONGE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"143%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"490%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$4,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Ethereum ETF","Sponge"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
