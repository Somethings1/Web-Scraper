Barbara Fried, Joseph Bankman, and Gabriel Bankman-Fried \u2014 SBF\u2019s mother, father, and brother \u2014 submitted pleas for leniency.","As anticipated, all three letters downplayed the impact of FTX\u2019s collapse on investors while requesting a lighter sentence stemming from SBF\u2019s felony charges. These letters were included in a batch of 26 supporting SBF, all submitted to Judge Lewis Kaplan, who will preside over the sentencing hearing on March 28.","SBF\u2019s younger brother, Gabriel Bankman-Fried, described his older brother as someone who \u201Cdid not always have an easy time relating to other people,\u201D but held a \u201Cdeeply caring\u201D nature. He emphasized the great effort put towards philanthropic work.","\u201CSam has made mistakes, but his life would be wasted in prison,\u201D Gabriel said. \u201CHe has great gifts to offer the world.\u201D\n","Joseph Bankman argued against a \u201Cdraconian sentence,\u201D suggesting the possibility of \u201Csignificant physical danger\u201D for his son, who he describes as having challenges responding to social cues. Bankman maintained that his son\u2019s priority was compensating investors before his arrest, minimizing any extravagant spending.","\u201CHe did what he thought he had to do for the good of the company,\u201D Bankman said. \u201CFor anyone that knows Sam, the popular portrayal of him as a high-rolling, celebrity-seeking, CEO driven by greed is simply bizarre.\u201D","In the most extensive letter of support, Barbara Fried highlighted her son\u2019s \u201Cdesire to help others\u201D throughout his life. She referenced SBF\u2019s current involvement in tutoring prison inmates to support this assertion.","First photo of Sam Bankman-Fried in jail at MDC Brooklyn.

She claimed he has been \u201Cwracked with remorse\u201D since the FTX collapse in November 2022.","\u201CBeing consigned to prison for decades will destroy Sam as surely as would hanging him,\u201D Fried said.","Social media reactions to the letters generally expressed disapproval.","\u201CAs an autistic advocate, SBF does not deserve to get off lightly for his crimes because of the \u2018autism defense,\u201D user @LucasGates92 commented. \u201CPurely a \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019. He knew what he did was fraud, and he should go to prison for the rest of his days.
