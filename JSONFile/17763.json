The Nordic region generates the second-highest amount of electricity per capita globally, with 100% of its energy coming from renewables.","The country also offers low energy prices, averaging $10 and $50 per MWh (megawatt-hour) from 2013 to 2020.","Aasland expressed disapproval of actors solely seeking to capitalize on cheap electricity in the region, as he stressed the importance of responsible energy use.","If the legislation passes, it could increase scrutiny and regulatory challenges for BTC miners in the country as their electricity consumption may be regulated, similar to what\u2019s been reported in the British Columbia Province in Canada. Those seeking to establish new mining operations or expand existing ones may face difficulties obtaining the necessary permits.","Norway\u2019s recent legislative focus on data centers coincides with growing concerns surrounding Bitcoin mining. These concerns were increased following a warning by 10x Research that BTC miners could liquidate up to $5 billion following the upcoming halving event.","#Bitcoin Might Trade Sideways for 6 months As Miners Could Sell $5bn of BTC -> Here is why: https:\/\/t.co\/gLRgs8yyGg pic.twitter.com\/zBLdV95MAl","\u2014 10x Research (@10x_Research) April 13, 2024","","With Bitcoin halving scheduled for April 20, 10x Research Head of Research Markus Thielen suggests that the crypto markets may not witness any upward trajectory until October 2024.","Conversely, Coincodex projects an optimistic market sentiment leading up to and post-halving with predictions that Bitcoin could experience a minor retracement about a month after the 2024 halving.
