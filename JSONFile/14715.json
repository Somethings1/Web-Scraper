The individual was revealed by CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb to be prominent crypto investor Roger Ver, a claim that Ver denied on social media.","In Saturday\u2019s post, CoinFLEX said it holds more than 26 million FLEX tokens \u2013 valued at over $7 million at current rates \u2013 in its inventory. It added that resuming trades would cause market volatility in FLEX's price, which would inadvertently affect the collateral positions of platform users.","The company also said that it is looking to raise a significant amount of funds from investors, including by using customer deposits in exchange for equity.","\u201CThere are a number of investors in this group of large depositors who have indicated that they may be in a position to help the business move forward if we can all find a workable solution,\u201D the firm said.","Recovering the delinquent debt, however, could help buffer FLEX prices and prevent a steep drop, CoinFLEX said. \u201CWe believe the recovery of the debt will help build confidence in and will help shore up the trading price of FLEX Coin,\u201D it said.","FLEX fell from $4.20 to $1.60 in late June as CoinFLEX went public with its losses, CoinGecko data shows. The lack of a swift recovery plan has added to the losses, with the tokens now down 94% in the past 30 days.","Meanwhile, CoinFLEX said that it hopes to make 10% of customers\u2019 balances available for withdrawal in the next week, adding that the arbitration process could \u201Ctake up to 12 months.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"International Arbitration Centre","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1.60","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4.20","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$84 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"94%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Roger Ver","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mark Lamb","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["CoinFLEX","Business","Debt"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
