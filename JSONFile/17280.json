This strategy was purportedly aimed at promoting its crypto trading services and gaining credibility among unsuspecting investors in Hong Kong.","According to SFC suspicion alert on its website, SFC wrote,","\u201CIt claims on the \u201Cnews\u201D website that the Hong Kong public has been using its technology to trade in cryptocurrencies and is able to earn \u201Ctoo-good-to-be-true\u201D returns.\u201D","In response to these allegations, the Hong Kong Police Force has intervened, taking action to block Quantum AI\u2019s website and remove associated social media pages at the request of the SFC.

Hong Kong police have restricted access to MEXC websites and are collaborating with the SFC to investigate further instances of fraudulent behavior.
