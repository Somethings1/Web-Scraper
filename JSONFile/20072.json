Titles like Axie Infinity cannot easily be accessed in the country, and the gaming regulator recently stated that it would be asking app marketplaces to remove P2E titles. ","In many cases, this has forced South Korean gaming firms into overseas markets with their blockchain releases \u2013 at the expense of the local gaming industry.","But in what may turn out to be a key development, Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party nominee in the nation\u2019s presidential elections, has launched a \u201Cgaming and metaverse\u201D unit ahead of March\u2019s vote. Lee has previously positioned himself as a crypto-friendly candidate, leading a parliamentary movement that successfully delayed the introduction of a tax on trading profits until 2023.","He has since gone further, speaking of the need to position South Korea at the forefront of crypto innovation in East Asia. Many have accused Lee of desperately trying to curry favor among younger voters, a growing number of whom are keen crypto investors.","Regardless, Lee now appears to have successfully positioned himself as the pro-business and industry 4.0-savvy candidate in what is essentially a two-horse race between himself and the People\u2019s Power Party candidate Yoon Suk-yeol.","The early evidence is that this stance has proved somewhat successful: Despite trailing Yoon in opinion polls late last year, a Realmeter opinion poll last week showed that Lee is now the frontrunner by a narrow margin, and is now winning the support of younger voters. Lee polled at almost 41% with Yoon on just over 39%. Lee also polled ahead of Yoon in every age group except the 60+ demographic, the firm reported.","At an event marking the launch of the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201CGaming and Metaverse Special Task Force,\u201D Lee was quoted as stating:","\u201CBlockchain, the metaverse and NFTs are new technologies that many people are not familiar with yet, but their ripple effect will be greater if they converge with games. The more powerful the new technology, the more we need to pay attention to the shadows that it casts. Everyone should be able to use technology without discrimination. However, the problem now is that the lower people\u2019s income is, the less accessible the technology is.\u201D","Lee also spoke in \u201Cpositive\u201D terms about metaverse, NFT, and gaming industry developments and noted that the domestic gaming industry was forecasted to grow to the USD 16.7bn mark in the year ahead, reported Hanguk Jungkyung Shinmun.","Although Lee refrained from making broader promises about regulatory change, the membership of the \u201Ctask force\u201D is significant \u2013 as was the event. A number of key figures from the gaming industry were in attendance, and spoke to the media in glowing terms about the future of P2E gaming.","While they also spoke about creating \u201Ca surveillance mechanism\u201D for P2E titles, they also explained there was a need to \u201Capproach gaming as a future industry,\u201D and noted that \u201CP2E should be approached as a business model for gaming companies.\u201D","Meanwhile, Donga reported that the value of \u201CSouth Korean\u201D real estate in the metaverse project Earth 2 is starting to rocket on both domestic and international platforms.","The media outlet noted that while South Korean virtual \u201Cland\u201D tiles were worth just USD 0.10 just over a year ago, \u201Ca little over a year later, the price of one tile in Jongno District [downtown Seoul], has reached 12,207 dollars\u201D \u2013 a price rise of \u201Cmore than x120,000.\u201D\n____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 Real Estate in the Metaverse Is Booming.
