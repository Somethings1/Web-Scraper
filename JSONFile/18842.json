ICP Price Up 20%, Bitcoin Rival Secures $8.8M Funding","category":["Industry Talk "],"content":["The price of Internet Computer (ICP) has shot up 20% in the last 24 hours as the token underpinning the blockchain-based computing ecosystem far outpaces market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum today.","Crypto prices are broadly rallying across the spectrum right now. Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) grew 2.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at $66,842, while its nearest contender Ethereum (ETH)  grew 1.8% to trade at $3,441 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko data. ","Today, ICP is the clear leader of the top 25 biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, though. No other leading cryptocurrency came close in terms of gains, except NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and Toncoin (TON), which both grew by a little over 10% overnight.","The value added by ICP\u2019s rally led to the token flipping NEAR for 21st place in the early hours of the morning GMT.","The only other cryptocurrency project enjoying a marked surge in the top 100 right now is Solana-based meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) which ballooned a blistering 21.7% to trade at $2.74.","ICP is a blockchain protocol that offers an alternative ","The Internet Computer attempts to offer a decentralized alternative to the centralized cloud-based data centres powering popular web applications currently. Its easy interface means anyone can create and deploy a dApp on ICP\u2019s public blockchain. ","ICP\u2019s trading chart reflects a bumpier February than many other cryptocurrencies. In March, ICP joined the market-wide rally, but it began to depreciate a fortnight into March and posted heavy losses by Wednesday as it bottomed out at $11. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 73, ICP is currently overbought, so an imminent correction is likely to occur.","The Internet Computer Protocol is about more than a token, it\u2019s an ecosystem that taps blockchain to unlock a fountain of new Web 3 innovations.","As such, the ICP token checks all the right boxes for a potentially very smart crypto investment for any blockchain acolyte. It is easier to argue the case for ICP still being here in a decade than it is for raw meme coins like DOGE, PEPE and WIF.","Green Bitcoin (GBTC) is another alt coin project that is raking in the money from excited early speculators. It has just raised $8.8 million in just over two weeks of its presale.","With Decentralized and Centralized exchange listings not far away, the momentum Green Bitcoin is generating is getting intense.","We love the movement! pic.twitter.com\/QeOhyUA35f","\u2014 GreenBitcoin (@GreenBTCtoken) March 23, 2024","","GBTC has a hardcap of 21 million, a clear nod to its inspiration, Bitcoin. Limiting the number of tokens in circulation creates value through scarcity.","However, GBTC\u2019s use of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain over Bitcoin\u2019s less energy-efficient proof-of-work mechanism makes it cleaner and greener than its inspiration.","Green Bitcoin touts itself as a \u201Cgamified green staking\u201D project. Essentially, token holders participate through the staking platform, where they earn GBTC rewards by predicting Bitcoin price trends.","Holders can stake tokens for up to six months to earn even bigger rewards. Staking is a fundamental part of Green Bitcoin\u2019s tokenomics. By reducing GBTC\u2019s circulating supply, staking helps drive the price over the long term.","Anyone can get involved by visiting the official Green Bitcoin website and connecting a crypto wallet.","1 GBTC presently costs $1.1062, with the price due to rise in a little over six days.","There are still a few weeks left of the presale, and the token could rally sharply by the time it\u2019s listed on major exchanges.","Get in early and Buy Green Bitcoin Now",""],"entity":[{"type":"$3,441","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.1062","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$8.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$11","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.74","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Green Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ICP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 23, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"21.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$66,842","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ICP","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Green Bitcoin","ICP","Internet Computer"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
