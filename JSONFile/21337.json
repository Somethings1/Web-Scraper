Crypto\u2019s fifth largest meme coin, inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s pet Shiba Inu of the same name, has rallied 8.8% in the last 24 hours and currently trades at a price of $0.0001887.","This means long-term FLOKI HODLers have found their digital coffers raised by 28% over the last 30 days and a staggering 430% from this time last year.","Many of the largest meme coins by market capitalization are pumping today despite the downturns posted by the market leaders.","The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC), fell 2% overnight and currently trades at $61,767. Ethereum ($ETH), the token underpinning the most commercially important blockchain, fell 2.4% to trade at $2,910.","Standing in stark contrast to either of the biggest coins, Pepe Coin ($PEPE) ballooned 19% to $0.00001056. Original meme coin Dogecoin ($DOGE) posted a light appreciation of around 3.6% and currently trades for $0.1497.","Over on FLOKI\u2019s trading chart, we can see a token that broadly rose in step with Bitcoin through early March to peak around the middle of the month.","Since then, the token has found strong support between $0.00015 and $0.0002 and appears stable today.","With a relative strength index (RSI) of 58 and falling, the token appears to be priced well, although the sell-off could pick up pace and end the rally.","Fun it may be on a good day, but FLOKI doesn\u2019t offer holders much of value.","Its cultural cache seems a bit limited too. After all, it\u2019s a meme coin about Elon Musk\u2019s dog.","Before FLOKI, we already had Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, after it we got Bonk and DogWifHat, so investing in FLOKI is really just speculating on future price rises.","However, for those who believe in crypto\u2019s longevity, a new generation of meme coins is cropping up which brings bundles of utility along with the laughs.","Leading this new generation of coins is WienerAI.","$WAI is a brand new meme token and AI companion that may yield potentially eye-watering rallies once word gets out about its core offering.","Thousands of people are bringing WIENER into their lives.","Will you join them?","ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ­ðŸ¤– pic.twitter.com\/xmm2XFP3dQ","\u2014 WienerAI (@WienerDogAI) May 12, 2024","","The presale is only a month old, and it has already attracted close $1.8 million in investments.","Touted as a \u201CRevolutionary AI Trading partner\u201D, WienerAI ($WAI) is a digital companion that gives its owners user-friendly AI-enhanced trading advice, seamless swap functionality and zero fees.","The WienerAI smart contract wasÂ audited by Coinsult, a blockchain security platform that conducts security checks on various crypto and blockchain platforms.","Around 20% of $WAI\u2019s supply is for staking.","WienerAI\u2019s websiteÂ offers buyers the ability to stake during the presale, in order to take advantage of the lucrative yield, which is currently 543% APY.","Stay on top of WienerAI news over onÂ XÂ andÂ Telegram.","Join the presale now over onÂ the WienerAI website.",""],"entity":[{"type":"$ETH","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Coinsult","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.0001887","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"3.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$WAI","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bonk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$0.1497","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.0002","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$DOGE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"last 30 days","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pepe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$BTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"8.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 12, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$0.00015","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.00001056","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$PEPE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"543%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"28%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"430%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$61,767","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2,910","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Floki","Meme Coins","wienerai"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
