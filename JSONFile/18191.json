The ban was instituted while he was serving the initial year of his five-year sentence.","Last month, Roman Storm, co-founder of the cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, submitted a motion to dismiss all three charges against him, claiming that he did not operate a money laundering business and did not violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.","In a filing with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Storm\u2019s lawyers argued that he cannot be accused of conspiring to launder funds.","According to Storm\u2019s legal team, Tornado Cash was developed, became immutable, and was publicly available before it was utilized by the hacking groups that were sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury. ","They said that Storm had limited control over preventing a \u201Csanctioned entity from using it\u201D by the time the alleged misconduct occurred."],"entity":[{"type":"Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Griffith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Virgil Griffith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kevin Castel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Commerce","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"North Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Griffith","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Glen Garrett McGorty","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"International Emergency Economic Powers Act","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S. Probation Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 17","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Griffith","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","North Korea"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
