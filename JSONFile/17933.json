LTC Price Blasts Up 20% and AI Crypto Predictions Platform yPredict Raises $2.7 Million","category":["Altcoin News "],"content":["Litecoin (LTC), the cryptocurrency that powers the decentralized payments-focused Litecoin blockchain, has pulled back from the more than one-year highs it hit earlier this week in the $115 area.","LTC\/USD was last exchanging for around $101 across major cryptocurrency exchanges, with LTC down about 2.5% on the day as the broader crypto market pulls back a little.","But LTC is still looking healthy.","At current levels above $100, the cryptocurrency is still up over 40% versus June\u2019s lows near $70.","And in the past seven days, LTC is still up over 20%.","Broader cryptocurrencies remain buoyed amid optimism about the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs.","Moreover, Litecoin continues to benefit from tailwinds relating to its listing on much-hyped new US cryptocurrency exchange EDX Markets and bullish sentiment ahead of August\u2019s halving event.","For reference, EDX Markets is backed by a number of major US financial institutions and is differentiating itself from its competitors as the most regulation compliant\/friendly US exchange.","Meanwhile, the August halving event, which takes place in just under 30 days, will see Litecoin\u2019s issuance rate halved from 12.5 LTC tokens per block to 6.25 LTC.","Whilst not always the case for Litecoin, halvings in bitcoin have historically been bullish and traders appear to be betting that the upcoming halving will be a bullish event for LTC.","In wake of the 40% rally from June\u2019s lows, some traders might be wondering whether they missed their chance to buy the dip.","Is it now too late to buy Litecoin?","The short answer: no, it probably isn\u2019t.","That\u2019s because the Litecoin price prediction outlook is strong, suggesting that those who invest at current price levels above $100 still stand a very good chance of generating strong near-term gains.","That\u2019s because, even when forgetting about the bullish tailwinds of strength in the broader crypto market (i.e. bitcoin close to yearly highs), the EDX Markets listing and the upcoming halving, Litecoin is looking great on the charts.","The bounce from June lows confirmed LTC remains in a solid uptrend since the 2022 lows.","Moreover, the recent pump highs that saw LTC move above all of its major moving averages once again also resulted in a bullish pennant structure break out.","While a dip to sub-$100 levels is a strong possibility, dip buyers could quickly force a rebound and push LTC into the mid-$100s.¬†","Investors should always be on the lookout to diversify their crypto holdings.","One high-risk-high-reward investment strategy that some investors might want to consider is getting involved in crypto presales.","This is where investors buy the tokens of up-start crypto projects to help fund their development.","These tokens are nearly always sold very cheap and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.","Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application\/platform.","If an investor can identify such projects, the risk\/reward of their presale investment is very good.","The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.","One such project that they think has a lot of potential is an artificial intelligence (AI) powered web3 start-up called¬†yPredict.","","üì£ yPredict Unveils Revolutionary AI-Driven Backlink Model, Disrupting Crypto and Marketing Sectors!\n\nüöÄ Witness the power of AI and blockchain technology with yPredict, as they launch their game-changing backlink model.
