We now believe these will ultimately be denied May 23rd for this round. The SEC hasn't engaged with issuers on Ethereum specifics. Exact opposite of #Bitcoin ETFs this fall. https:\/\/t.co\/TyAzAOrAC5","\u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) March 19, 2024","","That\u2019s owing to a lack of engagement between the SEC and issuers on Ethereum specifics, he said.","Well, that lack of engagement makes sense if the SEC is working with Swiss regulators to look into the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum\u2019s creator.","While the SEC hasn\u2019t outlined an official position on whether it views Ether a security or not, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long argued (including during his time as a professor at MIT) Ether is a security issued by the Ethereum Foundation.","The Ethereum Foundation sold ETH in a presale back in 2015 to fund blockchain development.","When the SEC approved Ether futures ETFs last year, this was interpreted by most as confirmation that the agency views ETH as a commodity, not a security.","But if the SEC is looking into the Ethereum Foundation, via a Swiss regulator, this raises the risk the agency might label it as a security.","If the SEC does this, then US exchanges would be forced to delist ETH. If they didn\u2019t, the SEC would likely accuse them of acting as an unlicensed securities exchange.","Of course, it\u2019s a big jump to assume the SEC is about to label Ether a security, just because an unnamed regulator has served the Ethereum Foundation.","But it does raise such risks.","In that sense, it makes sense that the ETH price has dropped.","Attention now turns to the upcoming Fed meeting, which could further pressure prices. That\u2019s if the Fed revises lower expectations as to the number of rate cuts it will make this year.","Profit-taking following Bitcoin hitting all-time highs last week also continues to weigh the market.","GBTC outflows are a particularly strong headwind.
