The phenomenon occurs as experienced traders take advantage of the crowded long trade, leading to the closure or liquidation of a large number of leveraged positions.","The potential approval of an ETF is generally seen as a bullish event as it opens the door for more institutional inflows into Bitcoin.","According to Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, a spot ETF means that as much as $30 trillion in \u201Cadvised wealth\u201D can potentially be invested in Bitcoin.","However, CryptoQuant noted that the current high unrealized profit margins of around 30% for short-term Bitcoin holders historically precede price corrections, as observed in previous instances.","\u201CMoreover, short-term holders are still spending Bitcoin at a profit, while rallies usually come after short-term losses are realized,\u201D the note said.Top of Form","At the time of writing on Friday, Bitcoin traded at $42,823, down by 2% for the past week.","A price of 32,000 after the ETF approval, expected by January 10, would mean the price needs to drop over 25% from its current level to a level not seen since October.",""],"entity":[{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$42,823","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$32,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Michael Sonnenshein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$30 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","ETF"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
