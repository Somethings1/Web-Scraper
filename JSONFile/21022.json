One that will bridge the gap between traditional and digital asset management. Until now, most of the financial instruments available to investors in the crypto universe gave them access to developments in the underlying assets, Bitcoin, Ethereum, ADA, etc.\u201D said Florian Volery, co-founder of Liqwid Finance, in a press release.","\u201CWe\u2019re going one step further, by putting ADA\u2019s outstanding assets to work and redistributing the interest to investors. Investors benefit from a double return on their investment, as well as lower management fees (1.5%) than the average of competing products,\u201D added Volery.","On Tuesday, Figment Europe Ltd, a provider of institutional staking infrastructure, and Apex Group listed two crypto ETPs on the SIX Swiss Exchange.","The \u201CFigment Ethereum Plus Staking Rewards\u201D ETP is trading under the ticker symbol \u201CETHF\u201D and the \u201CFigment Solana Plus Staking Rewards\u201D ETP is trading under the ticker \u201CSOLF.\u201D The products are fully backed by Ethereum and Solana, respectively, using Figment\u2019s staking infrastructure","According to crypto product providers, there is unprecedented demand for crypto ETPs and it remains a challenge for institutions to buy crypto and stake directly.  During the most recent crypto bear market, many ETPs faced closure.","For example, in March 2023, ETP provider 21Shares started delisting its Terra ETP and terminated five other crypto ETPs due to low investor demand.  The ETPs had only been open for less than a year.","Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) approved almost a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which has in turn triggered a bull market and trading frenzy.","In Europe, many issuers have successfully listed numerous cryptocurrency ETPs over the years ago giving investors exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Major crypto ETP providers in Europe include CoinShares, 21Shares, WisdomTree, ETC Group, Valour and Fidelity."],"entity":[{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Apex Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ETC Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Issuance.Swiss AG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Swiss Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CASL ETP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Volery","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Liqwid Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Figment Europe Ltd","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cardano Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Terra ETP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Florian Volery","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ETP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Cardano","Exchange Traded Products","SIX Swiss Exchange"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
