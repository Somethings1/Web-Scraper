In the post, Worldcoin said it uses \u201Cmystery shoppers\u201D to prevent minors from participating in the verification process.","The Worldcoin Foundation and its contributor, Tools for Humanity, affirmed that they have never sold, do not sell, and will never sell any personal data, including biometric data.","The project emphasized the self-custodial nature of World ID and World App, ensuring that only the owner possesses personal data such as name, email address, and phone number. Additionally, the project highlighted the advanced security features embedded in the Orb hardware to safeguard data from unauthorized access.","World ID verification relies on iris biometrics, not retina scanning, to authenticate users, the company noted. According to the company, i","ris images are processed locally on the orb device and are promptly deleted afterward, ensuring privacy and security.","The Worldcoin project was officially launched on July 24, 2023, after three years of development. The project was co-founded by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the firm behind the popular artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot ChatGPT.","Worldcoin\u2019s mission builds on expectations that it will become too difficult to differentiate between humans and online bots as AI technology grows. To differentiate humans from AI, the startup created a digital ID system based on proof of personhood. The digital ID is generated by scanning an individual\u2019s iris and giving them a World ID.","The blog post was issued amidst ongoing uncertainty surrounding Worldcoin\u2019s operations in Spain. On March 6, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) issued a temporary order prohibiting Worldcoin from data collection in the country for three months.","The AEPD intends to use this period to investigate complaints that users in Spain aren\u2019t able to withdraw consent and that Worldcoin has allegedly collected data from minors.","Despite Worldcoin\u2019s efforts, a local court rejected its injunction against the data regulator. Spain isn\u2019t the first country where Worldcoin has faced pressure from regulators. In January 2024, Hong Kong\u2019s Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) announced an investigation into the company\u2019s local operations, citing \u201Cserious risks to personal data privacy.\u201D ","The eye-scanning project has also encountered regulatory challenges with a ban in Kenya in August 2023, where the government suspended all local activities associated with the platform, including biometric identification. However, Worldcoin has since expressed intentions to collaborate with the Kenyan government to resume operations in 2024.","The controversy surrounding Worldcoin stems from its use of biometric scanning devices called \u201Corbs.\u201D Its users sign up for the service by downloading an app. They are then directed to the nearest facility containing an orb, where they must submit to have their eyes scanned. ","Once verified, user identities are tied to their unique biometric data, which can be verified independently using Worldcoin\u2019s services. Those who sign up for the service and activate their accounts in the World App application are paid using Worldcoin\u2019s WLD token."],"entity":[{"type":"General Data Protection Regulation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kenya","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 18, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July 24, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Argentina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Spanish Data Protection Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Spain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Worldcoin Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Sam Altman","Spain","Worldcoin"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
