Recent data indicates that more than $1 billion in treasury notes has been tokenized on public blockchain networks.","Andrew O\u2019Neill, Digital Assets Managing Director of S&P Global Ratings, told Cryptonews that the recent launch of BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL fund \u2013 currently the world\u2019s largest tokenized treasury fund \u2013 seems to be accelerating this trend.","\u201CAs shown in the chart, the launch of the BUIDL fund has steepened growth in outstanding volume,\u201D said O\u2019Neill.","\u201CIt\u2019s also interesting to note Larry Fink\u2019s public statements on the role of tokenization in the future of BlackRock and financial markets, to understand the context in which this is being done,\u201D O\u2019Neill added.","Indeed, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently mentioned that capital markets could be made more efficient by moving on-chain.","\u201CTokenized treasuries are digital tokens created on a blockchain that are backed by a portfolio of U.S. government obligations,\u201D O\u2019Neill explained. \u201CThese assets are issued both by blockchain-native firms and traditional institutions.\u201D","O\u2019Neill believes that tokenized treasuries are becoming more important because they can help money market funds and their investors manage liquidity.","Tokenized U.S. Treasuries just topped $1B","$26.99T to go pic.twitter.com\/PDF0uqksj3","\u2014 Camila Russo (@CamiRusso) April 5, 2024","","For example, O\u2019Neill noted that in times of market volatility, investors may need to meet margin calls on some positions.","\u201CMoney market fund investors may seek to redeem their shares in the fund for cash to meet these obligations,\u201D said O\u2019Neill.","O\u2019Neill noted that if many investors redeemed at once, however, this would increase the fund\u2019s liquidity risk.","While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently increased funds\u2019 minimum liquid assets requirements to mitigate this risk, O\u2019Neill believes that tokenization can be beneficial.","Franklin Templeton's Tokenized Money Market Fund Approved & Regulated by The #SEC.

In turn, this could reduce the risk of a run on a fund.","Franklin Templeton recently enabled peer-to-peer transfers on tokens from its FOBXX fund to support such a capability.","Chris Yin, CEO and Co-founder of Plume Network \u2013 a layer-2 focused on RWAs \u2013 told Cryptonews that FOBXX seeks to provide investors with a secure and liquid investment vehicle.","\u201CFOBXX utilizes the Stellar blockchain for transaction processing, aiming to enhance transparency and reduce operational costs,\u201D said Yin. \u201CIt is accessible through the Benji Investments app, which further allows for digital wallet integration.\u201D","Yin added that the real game changer behind tokenized treasuries is the enablement of fractional ownership of real-world assets (RWAs).","\u201CThis approach enhances efficiency and allows for fractional ownership, expanding access to a broader base of investors,\u201D Yin explained.","While the concept is still new, tokenized treasuries could be divided into smaller units. Unlike traditional treasury notes with high minimum investment requirements, tokenization allows for even small investors to participate.","\u201CBy starting with U.S. Treasuries, which are low-risk and familiar, they provide a gateway for investors to engage with on-chain assets,\u201D said Yin.","While tokenized treasuries provide a number of benefits, how investors will engage with these new assets is unclear.","This asset class is still emerging, and investor interest likewise,\u201D said O\u2019Neill. \u201CA significant jump in investor interest requires that investors can fully realize the benefits of holding a tokenized asset.\u201D","To achieve this, O\u2019Neill believes that blockchain interoperability is needed to support active secondary markets.","\u201CThe ability to mobilize the tokenized asset itself as collateral, rather than having to redeem shares in a fund, is attractive, and this is already technically possible in some cases,\u201D said O\u2019Neill. \u201CHowever, there is not yet a meaningful secondary market for trading these assets.\u201D","Additionally, O\u2019Neill noted that solutions are required to bridge cash transactions on-chain.","The other important aspect is enabling on-chain cash legs to support delivery-vs-payment transactions,\u201D he said. \u201CIf a tokenized asset can be transferred on-chain, but the actual payments for a transaction are made off-chain in a traditional way, there is little gain for investors.\u201D","BLACKROCK'S BUIDL SECURES THIRD OF TOKENIZED TREASURIES MARKET","BlackRock's fund has amassed $381M since its March 20 launch.","This positions BUIDL ahead of Franklin Templeton\u2019s fund, which holds $360M in tokenized Treasuries on Polygon and Stellar.","Source: DL News pic.twitter.com\/VH3CQ0CmRH","\u2014 Mario Nawfal\u2019s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) May 16, 2024","","While this may be the case, Blackrock\u2019s BUIDL fund illustrates how investors can access 24\/7 liquidity through a smart contract using a stablecoin. O\u2019Neill believes that regulatory clarity around stablecoins will help investors engage with these types of features moving forward.","Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Research Analyst James Seyffart told Cryptonews that firms including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree are demonstrating how blockchain can streamline aspects of traditional finance.","\u201CWe\u2019re in the very early innings for all of this, but firms are trying many different things and the market will ultimately decide what sticks,\u201D said Seyffart.","Yet, for tokenized treasuries to be successful, O\u2019Neill believes that investors require direct access to the blockchains on which the tokenized assets are built. He also mentioned that institutions need to connect their legacy systems to those blockchains.","With this in mind, Yin explained that Plume Network seeks to simplify the process of RWA project deployment, while presenting investors with a blockchain ecosystem to cross-pollinate and invest in various RWAs.","\u201CPlume Network enables RWA composability through its thriving DeFi applications and provides access to high-quality buyers to increase liquidity for all RWAs,\u201D he said. \u201CThrough the various projects in our ecosystem, we provide crypto use cases \u2013 borrow\/lend, trade, speculate, yield farm, etc. \u2013 to RWAs in order to uncover net new liquidity.\u201D","Yin also thinks that as institutional investors increasingly adopt RWAs, a new wave of retail investors will inject capital into blockchain ecosystems like never before.","\u201CBy initially focusing on building traction within this community and gradually expanding towards institutional adoption, where the pace is typically slower, sustainable growth and mainstream acceptance can be achieved,\u201D Yin remarked.","O\u2019Neill further stated that emerging regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions will enhance investors\u2019 appetite to engage with stablecoins and the features they enable.","\u201CSuch as the BUIDL fund example of disintermediated redemption through a smart contract,\u201D he said."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 15, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tokenized Money Market Fund Approved & Regulated","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Plume Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Larry Fink","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Treasuries","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blackrock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$381M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Digital Assets Managing Director of S&P Global Ratings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1B","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Yin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mario Nawfal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andrew O\u2019Neill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Benji Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$26.99","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Camila Russo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DL News pic.twitter.com\/VH3CQ0CmRH","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$360M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 16, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cryptonews","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chris Yin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["RWA","Tokenization","Tokenized Funds"],"authors":["Rachel Wolfson"]}
