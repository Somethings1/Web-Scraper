Gillibrand and I see the small differences between the House and the Senate versions specifically related to stablecoins and we know they\u2019re resolvable,\u201D she said.","\u201CSo I think we\u2019re going to be able to get to a resolution on stablecoins now that the House has a new speaker and they\u2019re again open for business.\u201D","Lummis is hopeful that this legislation will pass in early 2024 and is open to incorporating specific provisions into other legislative packages.","In recent weeks, a portion of Lummis\u2019 bill addressing terrorist financing was included in the Senate\u2019s defense spending package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act.","This legislation is currently being discussed and reconciled with the House.","Lummis believes that such measures are crucial, highlighting the concerns that organizations like Hamas are using cryptocurrencies to support their activities.","The senator also expressed support for the House Financial Services Committee\u2019s crypto framework, led by Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.).","She is content with whichever legislative body is able to make progress first, emphasizing the importance of reaching a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry.","Last week, Democratic lawmaker Representative Wiley Nickel from North Carolina criticized the SEC\u2019s management of a controversial bulletin concerning the accounting of companies\u2019 crypto holdings.","He voiced concerns about the potential repercussions of the bulletin, stating that it could undermine the safety of digital assets.","Several other members of Congress have also voiced concerns regarding the bulletin.","Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina, and Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has said he believes the bulletin imposes substantial new requirements on financial institutions and could discourage them from offering custodial services."],"entity":[{"type":"N.Y.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wyo.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Patrick McHenry","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Yahoo Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Government Accountability Office (GAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wiley Nickel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hamas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"North Carolina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kirsten Gillibrand","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"National Defense","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cynthia Lummis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gillibrand","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Securities and Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
