The trial is expected to take place in early 2024.","It is important to note that the Bitcoin code is open-sourced and distributed freely under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology license, allowing users to reuse the code for any purpose, including proprietary software. ","Wright, on the other hand, contends that the Bitcoin Core developers form a centralized entity, referred to as the \u201CBitcoin Partnership,\u201D which controls the Bitcoin network. ","Meanwhile, in another blow to Wright\u2019s claim that he is the mysterious Bitcoin creator, a recent investigation provided evidence to suggest that Nakamoto may actually be a collective entity.  ","One piece of evidence is the usage of both \u201Cwe\u201D and \u201CI\u201D in the Bitcoin white paper, indicating the possibility of a team operating under a singular pseudonym.","Another piece of evidence comes from the linguistic analysis of Nakamoto\u2019s writings. ","The white paper showcases impeccable English with precise language and accurate usage of technical terms. But since Nakamoto\u2019s writing style appears to be different in forums and email correspondences, this suggests multiple individuals were involved. ","A linguistic analysis of Nakamoto\u2019s forum posts revealed varying writing styles, further supporting the theory of a collective behind the pseudonym."],"entity":[{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UK Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Defense Fund","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blockstream","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Craig Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Oslo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Partnership","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nakamoto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Cash","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Satoshi Vision","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Craig Wright","Satoshi Nakamoto"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
