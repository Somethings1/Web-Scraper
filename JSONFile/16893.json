Aggregate crypto losses reached $4.3 billion this year on the back of one particular exit scam, \"Plus Token.\"","Given that CipherTrace\u2019s price estimations are set at the time of initial reporting, current valuations would be much higher.","Included within Q1 is the QuadrigaCX exchange collapse which CipherTrace labelled an exit scam. Investors lost $195 million.","CipherTrace further claims 2019 may be the \u201CYear of the Exit Scam,\u201D with $3.1 billion stolen through exits and another $874 million in misappropriated funds. These numbers, CipherTrace notes, are only preliminary with numerous other allegations under investigation.Â ","An unconfirmed exit scam by South Korean exchange and pyramid scheme Plus Token is included in the estimates. Investors are suspected to have lost as much as $2.9 billion. The details around the exit scam have yet to be established, however.","In total, investors, users, and exchanges have lost almost $4.3 billion from illicit activity year to date.","CipherTrace notes that illicit funds will soon come under more intense scrutiny following the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s (FATF) recent Travel Rule.
