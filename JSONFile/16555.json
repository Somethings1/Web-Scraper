Speaking at the 21 Utah Bankers Association Annual Convention, Quarles added that the U.S. central bank has a \u201Cstrong regulatory interest\u201D in stablecoins but also said there is no need to fear them.Â ","","","\u201CWhen our concerns have been addressed, we should be saying yes to these products, rather than straining to find ways to say no,\u201D Quarles said. \u201CIndeed, the combination of imminent improvements in the existing payments system such as various instant payments initiatives combined with the cross-border efficiency of properly structured stablecoins could well make superfluous any effort to develop\" a central bank digital currency.","","","Among the concerns Quarles highlighted was the possibility stablecoins that were fractional rather than fully reserved could create a \u201Crun risk\u201D for consumers. Last week, Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, listed tether among the \u201Cfinancial stability challenges\u201D the Fed is watching.","","","Quarles also downplayed bitcoin and foreign CBDCs as potential threats to the U.S. dollar.",""],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Utah Bankers Association Annual Convention","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Reserve Bank of Boston","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Utah","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Quarles","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lael Brainard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Randal Quarles","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eric Rosengren","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Federal Reserve","Randal Quarles","Stablecoins"],"authors":["Nate DiCamillo"]}
