The regulator is poised to hand out 60 licenses to crypto firms under the regime in the coming weeks and has so far awarded licenses to crypto firms Luno, Zignaly and VALR. The country brought crypto providers into the scope of its Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act in 2022 so it could regulate digital assets as financial products.","\"This signals a forward-thinking approach to regulating the crypto space, aligning with global trends and acknowledging the growing significance of blockchain technology in modern finance,\" Maurice Crespi, a partner at South Africa-based law firm Schindlers Attorneys, said in a statement.","The country is set to choose its president on May 29.

Tokenization is the representation of real-world assets on a blockchain.","\"I think that in South Africa, in particular, the work that has been done on digital assets has been to address problems that in many respects are apolitical, and the approach they've taken has been apolitical as well,\" John McCarthy, general counsel for global regulatory affairs at Fireblocks, said in an interview with CoinDesk. \"It's also been through an intergovernmental working body, much of which is inherently apolitical.\"","Read more: South Africa to Start Work on Stablecoin Regime, Will Start by Considering Use Cases","Edited by Jesse Hamilton."],"entity":[{"type":"VALR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"[South African Reserve Bank]","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John McCarthy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nuud Money","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Schindlers Attorneys","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Democratic Alliance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Sector Conduct Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Advisory","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ndamane","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FSCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mpumelelo Ndamane","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ANC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Maurice Crespi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Stablecoin Regime","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Economic Freedom Fighters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"National Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jesse Hamilton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"African National Congress (ANC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Election 2024","South Africa Election"],"authors":["Camomile Shumba"]}
