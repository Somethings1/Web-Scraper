It did not specify which firm would conduct the audits.","The move positions Ripple as a competitor to established leaders in the stablecoin market, like Tether and Circle. Notably, PayPal entered the fray last year with the launch of its own USD-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), on Ethereum.","1\/ The stablecoin market is booming \u2013 around $150B today, and projected to soar past $2.8T by 2028. There's a clear demand for trust, stability, and utility.","That's why later this year we\u2019re launching a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the USD on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum.\u2026","\u2014 Ripple (@Ripple) April 4, 2024","","Tether co-founder William Quigley told Cryptonews that PayPal would be unlikely to achieve dominance in this market, particularly outside the US. However, PayPal\u2019s stablecoin currently holds the 12th position globally, boasting a market capitalization of $190m.","Stablecoins represent a distinct class of cryptocurrency specifically engineered to exhibit minimal price fluctuations. This stability is achieved by pegging their value to external assets, such as traditional fiat currencies or financial instruments.","As a result, they offer a significantly less volatile alternative compared to established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This makes them particularly attractive to risk-averse investors looking for a more stable investment vehicle.","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that institutions entering the stablecoin market are finding success by partnering with compliant, crypto-native players. \u201CAnd Ripple\u2019s track record and resiliency speaks for itself, as we launch new products and acquire companies through multiple market cycles,\u201D he added.","The move also drives \u201Cmore use cases, liquidity and opportunities for developers and users,\u201D he said.","Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will initially launch on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains. Eventually, Ripple plans to expand its availability to additional blockchains, DeFi protocols, and various applications.","The decision to launch on both XRPL and Ethereum facilitates cross-chain interoperability, a crucial feature for seamless interaction between disparate blockchain networks.","Ripple intends to integrate both XRP and the stablecoin into its payment solutions, aiming to enhance customer experience and establish the first large-scale enterprise use case for the asset. Notably, Ripple\u2019s customers in emerging markets have expressed interest in facilitating stablecoin payouts.","The initial launch is reportedly targeted at the US market. But the network hasn\u2019t ruled out the possibility of introducing regional variations for other markets such as Europe and Asia."],"entity":[{"type":"2028","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 4, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.8","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$150B","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Brad Garlinghouse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"William Quigley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ripple","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$190m","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Ripple","Stablecoin"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
