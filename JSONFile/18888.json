Bitcoin transactions have been running on the protocol since 2017.","\u201CZooming out \u2013 we think paying for stuff online with crypto won\u2019t really go mainstream until we get off Layer 1, and reduce transaction fees and confirmation times, so we\u2019re trying to accelerate the move toward that world.\u201D","This isn't quite right, so let me share some more context in case helpful:","\u2013 Commerce uses a new EVM payment protocol.\n\u2013 You can pay from any self-custody wallet\n\u2013 We believe paying with crypto is going to primarily happen on Layer 2 in the future and we want to help make that\u2026","\u2014 Brian Armstrong üõ°Ô∏è (@brian_armstrong) February 17, 2024","","The UTXO model, used by Bitcoin and its forks like Dogecoin, Litecoin, Dash, and Bitcoin Cash, is designed for transparency and security.","In contrast, Ethereum utilizes an account model more akin to traditional bank accounts, offering greater flexibility.","Coinbase\u2019s decision to remove native Bitcoin support has sparked criticism within the community, with some users expressing concerns about the impact on Bitcoin adoption.","Critics argue that assuming every customer has a Coinbase account or is based in the United States, where Coinbase operates, may limit broader acceptance.","They compare it to dictating that customers must be Bank of America account holders for merchants who solely bank with Bank of America to accept payments.","Coinbase is often acting as if they are fighting the good fight, but don't be fooled, they aren't.","Example, 'Coinbase Commerce' no longer supports payments from self-custody wallets or third party exchanges:","'You can still accept Bitcoin, [\u2026] payments as long as your\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/vgyTO7MLLq","\u2014 CR1337 (@cryptonator1337) February 18, 2024","","The new development comes shortly after Coinbase announced its quarterly report, which showed a 64% jump in transaction revenue to take in $529.3 million in Q4, 2023."],"entity":[{"type":"Dowling","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase Commerce","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bank of America","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"64%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lauren Dowling","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lightning Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Armstrong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Cash","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 18, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Commerce","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 17, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$529.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Coinbase Commerce\u2019s EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTXO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Coinbase","etherem"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
