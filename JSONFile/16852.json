The team announced Monday a $3.75 million seed round co-led by Framework, IOSG Ventures and Apollo Capital.","Ethereum, like most other blockchains, relies on a distributed network of volunteers to keep itself secure. While the network originally took after Bitcoin by employing a resource-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model for validating transactions, it is in the midst of transitioning to a more efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) model, where one can stake 32 ether to become a network validator and deploy a node.","In exchange for lending compute power to help secure Ethereum, validators get a percentage of the fees generated as users transact on the network.","Read more: 10M Ether Now Locked on Eth 2.0 Staking Contract","Currently, it costs 32 ETH (about $82,000) to become a validator, though Swell and others are looking to lower that barrier to entry. Swell\u2019s minimum commitment is 1 ETH. Significantly, the protocol will provide stakers with liquidity by granting them an interest-bearing token representing their stake.","Similar liquid staking solutions to Swell already exist \u2013 the most popular being Rocket Pool and Lido. Both products already make it easy for users to enter and exit their staking positions, and they allow minimum deposits much lower than Swell\u2019s 1 ETH. Rocket Pool requires a minimum deposit of just .01 ETH, and Lido doesn\u2019t have a minimum at all.","Read more: ETH Staking Startup ssv.network Raises $10M as Ethereum \u2018Merge\u2019 Inches Closer","Swell says its main advantage is in making it easier for users to earn additional interest through in-app \u201Cvaults.\u201D","\u201CWe do everything for the user,\u201D Swell co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Lecky Lao said of the project\u2019s vaults feature. \u201CAfter they stake, they get an NFT they can optionally put into a vault if they want to get some extra yield from DeFi farming.
