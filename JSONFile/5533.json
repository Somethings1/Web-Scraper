The Merge \u2014 which will change the current proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof of stake \u2014 has been in the pipeline for years and is set to be executed <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">this week.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The social layer has played an influential role in the journey to this point, says Sassano. He theorizes that the ideals of Ethereum community are one explanation for why The Merge has taken so long to pull off. For instance, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s goal&nbsp;to provide a system that gives users more control over their data, is decentralized and requires buy-in to make changes at the protocol level. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe wanted to bake in those ideals into the technology, which is extremely hard to do. And it's hard to live up to such extreme ideals on the technology side, you have to make compromises, but you also have to make sure that the community is happy with that,\u201D he says.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If successful, The Merge will go down as the community\u2019s greatest achievement. But to Sassano, the recent action by the U.S. government to sanction Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based protocol designed to mix up cryptographic transactions in such a way that they become untraceable, shows why Ethereum must take The Merge in stride \u2014 and prepare for the final boss. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sassano has said&nbsp;that&nbsp;Ethereum\u2019s social layer is&nbsp;\u201Cthe most important thing for a network and ultimately our last line of defense against any adversaries.\u201D<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the case of Tornado Cash, the adversary is clear \u2014 and may now be on the offensive. \u201CI mean, they wouldn't have sanctioned Tornado Cash if they were able to trace it,\u201D he adds. \u201CSo basically, it worked.
