Also, you\u2019re generally considered an immortal superstar who doesn\u2019t need to go down the same path us mortals do, to get something done.\nAt least that is what one may think, after seeing this (clumsy) tweet:","To put things into more perspective, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, a public blockchain and cryptocurrency project, co-founder and ex-CEO of the Ethereum platform, as well as CEO of Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), a tech company, reached out to MetaMask app via Twitter, asking about the recent Chrome app store delisting at a time when the latter was trying to figure out why they got delisted in the first place.","As you might expect, Twitter and Reddit all but crucified the man, pointing out how his ego grew larger than him. However, Hoskinson was quick to emphasize that it has nothing to do with ego, but rather with efficiency because, as he says, Microsoft would never tell the CEO of Ford to contact them through customer support.","\u201CI was making a point to a project I like and respect. Don\u2019t blow off CEOs when they take the time to reach out to you. It\u2019s just stupid regardless of whether you like them or not.\u201D","He even drew parallels with Elon Musk and the way he communicates through Twitter. Suffice it to say, the community wasn\u2019t impressed by his shenanigans.","\u201CLOL what a response. Muhhh research muhhh CEO muhhh Elon,\u201D was one we found particularly funny.","\u201CGet called out for elite\/impolite\/rude behavior \u2013 defends self by pointing to ruder person. Like a person on trial pointing to someone else \u201CHey, I only killed one person, that guy over there killed five\u201D. It doesn\u2019t excuse the fact your behavior wasn\u2019t socially appropriate.\u201D","However another user of Reddit, runny6play, points out: \u201CYeah, I mean the way he worded it sounds bad, but honestly an active CEO in the same space should have more pull than having to email support. Then again if he\u2019s CEO of a less than 10 man company and it is a shitcoin with no standing, then really maybe not.\u201D","For example, market capitalization of ADA (Cardano cryptocurrency) currently stands at USD 4.2bn."],"entity":[{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hoskinson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ford","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Microsoft","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"muhhh Elon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Charles Hoskinson","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Cardano","Community","MetaMask"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
