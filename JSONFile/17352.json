Some of the previous founders of that project are now part of the @ZKasino_io team, which appears to be fraudulent.","We have never invested in ZKasino\u2026","\u2014 Big Brain Holdings (@BigBrainVC) April 21, 2024","","Amidst the mounting backlash, ZKasino has remained largely silent on X, with the project only posting an unremarkable update about integrating EIP-3074.","Meanwhile, the Ethereum network has surpassed one million validators, with approximately 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion, staked within the network.","As reported, data from the Dune Analytics dashboard, which tracks Ethereum staking progress, show that the validator count reached the one million mark on March 28. ","The 32 million ETH staked represents approximately 26% of the total supply, highlighting the substantial commitment to Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism."," "],"entity":[{"type":"$114 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$350 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.055","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$33","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Big Brain Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 21, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Big Brain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.68","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2,871","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lido","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dune Analytics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"26%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"3074","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3,083","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monke","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$33 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"+7%","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["crypto adoption","Ethereum staking"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
