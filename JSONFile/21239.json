This is evidenced by his recent efforts to secure a headquarters for Binance to aid in regulatory compliance.","It is an honour and with the deepest humility that I step into the role of Binance\u2019s new CEO.","We operate the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. The trust placed on us by our 150m users and thousands of employees is a responsibility that I take seriously and hold\u2026","\u2014 Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) November 21, 2023","","Teng has also pushed the exchange forward by obtaining a Dubai crypto license, signaling a shift in the negative Binance narrative as a symbol of trust from a major jurisdiction.","However, these efforts are constantly overshadowed by Binances shaky past when it comes to regulation."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ontario Securities Commission (OSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Canda","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Richard Teng","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"OSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ontario","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 21, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$5000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ontario\u2019s Superior Court of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Christopher Lochan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jeremy Leeder","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Canada","Lawsuit"],"authors":["Harvey Hunter"]}
