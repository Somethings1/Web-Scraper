The Samourai Wallet offered a \u201Cprivacy\u201D service which keeps your transactions private and your identity masked. Both of the defendants knew that it was a haven for criminals to engage in large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion, said the U.S. Department of Justice press release.","From 2015 through February 2024, both Rodriguez and Hill developed, marketed, and operated a cryptocurrency mixing service known as Samourai, which was an unlicensed money-transmitting business from which they earned millions of dollars in fees. ","According to the release, the defendants intended and knew that a substantial portion of the funds that Samourai processed were criminal proceeds passed through Samourai for purposes of concealment. ","\u201CDuring the relevant period, Samourai laundered over $100 million of crime proceeds originating from, among other criminal sources, illegal dark web markets, such as Silk Road and Hydra Market; various wire fraud and computer fraud schemes, including a web-server intrusion, a spearphishing scheme, and schemes to defraud multiple decentralized finance protocols; and other illegal activities,\u201D said the DoJ. ","The DoJ said both Rodriguez and Hill operated social media Twitter (now X) accounts that encouraged and openly invited users to launder criminal proceeds through Samourai. ","Giving an example from around June 2022, Samourai\u2019s Twitter account which was being operated by Rodriguez \u2014 posted the following message regarding Russian oligarchs seeking to circumvent sanctions:","","The authorities said in a private message on or about August 27, 2020, Hill also using a Twitter account with the username \u201CSamourai Dev\u201D \u2014 discussed the use of Samourai by criminals operating in online black markets such as Silk Road in private messages with another Twitter user.","The U.S. authorities have been clamping down on cryptocurrency crime. Recently Chainalysis\u2019 Crypto Crime Report highlighted that funds sent to mixers from illicit addresses decreased by nearly half a billion dollars last year \u201Clikely due to law enforcement and regulatory efforts.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"June 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"a billion dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Samourai Wallet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Samourai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Samourai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Samourai Dev","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 27, 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Rodriguez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"DoJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"William Lonergan Hill","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["anti-money laundering","Crypto mixers","Samourai Wallet"],"authors":["Tanzeel Akhtar"]}
