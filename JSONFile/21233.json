But if there\u2019s a buyer and a seller of an asset, someone\u2019s got to make that market.\u201D","For van Eck, the market structure around liquidity is the core issue.","\u201CAnd you think, \u2018Oh, Jan, S&P 500 \u2013 it\u2019s so obvious. So easy to price.\u2019,\u201D he added. \u201CBut someone has to make a market in it, and someone\u2019s got to make money making a market in it, so it\u2019s not just that [someone] can create a tokenized real-world asset of anything, it\u2019s who\u2019s providing the market structure around the liquidity.\u201D","The CEO highlighted the second major obstacle in real-world asset tokenization as the challenge of finding a market location that avoids a \u201Cregulatory headache.\u201D","\u201CIn the world today, you\u2019re not doing that in the United States,\u201D van Eck said. \u201CThat\u2019s fine. My bet is on Europe just because it\u2019s got a large retail market as well as having a regulatory structure that enables crypto investing and trading.\u201D","","Van Eck continued by saying that he \u201Cwishes he could figure out a path to tokenize ETFs,\u201D but that the aforementioned obstacles would still apply.","VanEck is among the 11 firms that obtained approval from the SEC to introduce a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month.","Despite the challenges, many people think the tokenization of real-world assets will become a thriving sector in 2024 and beyond. One such industry insider who thinks RWAs are set for major growth over the next decade is Jasper De Maere, research lead at Outlier Ventures.","During an interview on Yahoo Finance Future Focus, De Maere highlighted that the total addressable market for the tokenization of real-world assets is projected to reach between $10 trillion to $15 trillion by the end of the decade.","\u201CAs the technology diffuses across society over the next decade, we believe that it will have a transformative impact on industries such as financial markets, manufacturing, healthcare, and infrastructure,\u201D De Maere said."],"entity":[{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan van Eck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Eck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Raoul Pal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$15 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Maere","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Outlier Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yahoo Finance Future Focus","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Asset tokenization","RWA","VanEck"],"authors":["Brian Yue"]}
