The company proposed deploying the system on the Ethereum layer 2 network StarkNet.","Currently, there are two types of accounts on the Ethereum network: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) controlled by a private key, and Contract Accounts (CA), which are essentially smart contracts.","EOAs can initiate transactions, but CAs cannot. However, by using Account Abstraction it is possible to create a smart contract that can initiate transactions on behalf of an EOA, enabling the creation of a self-custodial wallet that can make automatic recurring payments, Visa said.","Account Abstraction (AA) is a proposal that aims to combine user accounts and smart contracts into a single type of account on the Ethereum blockchain. This is possible by allowing for the creation of validity rules for individual transactions.","One use case for AA is the creation of \"delegable accounts,\" which allow for the automation of payments through the use of smart contracts.","With a delegable account, a user can delegate the ability to initiate a payment to a pre-approved smart contract, known as an \"auto payment contract,\u201D Visa said.","Here\u2019s how it could hypothetically work: When a user visits a merchant's website and agrees to allow for auto payments, the auto payment contract's address is added to the user's allow list.","The merchant could then trigger a payment by calling the charge function of the auto payment contract, causing the user's account to initiate a payment that will be valid due to its presence on the allow list.","As of Tuesday, Visa did not reveal any plans to use the system as part of its offered services."],"entity":[{"type":"EOA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Visa","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["DeFi","payments","Ethereum","Visa"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
