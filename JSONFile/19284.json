This time, its creator Jackson Palmer has launched a bot that tweets lines from the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, mashed with jargon-filled lines from industry whitepapers.","Fifty Shades of Blockchain is a new Twitter account that Palmer says he\u2019ll keep developing so nobody misses out on the juicy life of the crypto Mr. Grey, according to thenextweb.com. The original novel was filled to bursting with groan-worthy phrases such as \u201Cmy inner goddess\u201D (that keeps jumping up and down all the time\u2026) and \u201Cdesire pools dark and deadly in my groin,\u201D and this is not the first parody of the infamous book. But it definitely is in the cryptoverse.","Highlights of the lovely works of art that the bot comes up with include:","And this is not even the first time that the Dogecoin community came up with something equally hilarious and astounding.
