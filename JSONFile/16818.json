Launched by Ava Labs in 2020, Avalanche\u2019s native AVAX token has a capped supply of 720 million and is used as part of the consensus mechanism and for paying network fees.","AVAX has soared in price recently, trading at $104.21, up 85% in the last month alone. The gains pushed the token\u2019s market capitalization to about $23 billion, vaulting past Terra\u2019s LUNA token to become the fifth-largest among Ethereum competitors, or so-called layer 1 (base layer) alternatives.","\u201CAvax has seen significant growth in the past two months consistent with the rest of the layer 1 market,\u201D said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer of Stack Funds. \u201CWe expect that AVAX will continue to head north in the near term while demand for layer 1s is still high.\u201D","Avalanche founder and Ava Labs CEO Emin Gun Sirer said Tuesday his company will be partnering with \u201CBig Four\u201D accounting firm Deloitte \u201Cto build more efficient disaster relief platforms using the Avalanche blockchain.\u201D","Some analysts say the announcement may have propelled the latest leg up in the AVAX coin price.","Avalanche has announced more than $600 million of initiatives recently to spur growth on the network. In September, the Avalanche Foundation announced a $230 million raise to jump-start liquidity in the network\u2019s burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Then, in early November, Avalanche developers and investors formed a $200 million Blizzard Investment Fund. There\u2019s also Avalanche Rush, a $180 million liquidity mining incentive fund.","Dibb said the new efforts have spurred \u201Ca large transition of projects and applications to move from Ethereum over to Avalanche.\u201D","\u201CAvalanche has received positive news coverage over its new $200 million funding for its DeFi platform and this new Deloitte partnership,\u201D Freddie Evans, sales trader at digital-asset broker GlobalBlock, said in emailed comments.","Juan Pellicer, analyst at IntoTheBlock, said he was \u201Cexcited to see how Avalanche continues to grow its DeFi ecosystem, for example by launching liquid staking products,\u201D such as allowing users to stake their crypto in one pool and use their staked assets to farm yields in a liquidity provider pool or vice versa, \u201Cwill allow investors and traders to be more capital efficient while helping secure the network in a decentralized manner.\u201C","\u201CThis could possibly be a catalyst for the demand of AVAX,\u201D he said.","Ethereum (ETH) is down 8.4% on the week, trading near $4,245 at press time.","Avalanche\u2019s price gains also appeared to diverge from other layer 1 tokens.
