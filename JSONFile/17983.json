Its latest attestation report in February 2024 said there were just 169,303.77 QCAD in circulation versus CAD $200,903.17 in Stablecorp\u2019s reserves.","Assets added to the roadmap today: QCAD (QCAD)https:\/\/t.co\/rRB9d3hSr2","\u2014 Coinbase Assets üõ°Ô∏èüìû (@CoinbaseAssets) April 29, 2024","","That\u2019s a small amount relative to stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC, which have over $140 billion USD worth of tokens combined spread throughout the crypto ecosystem.","\u201COur goal is to list every asset possible that meets our standards for legal, compliance, and technical security,\u201D Coinbase\u2019s blog post on upcoming listings stated. \u201CThese standards do not take into account the market cap or popularity of a project.\u201D","As such, onboarding Coinbase \u2013 the largest crypto exchange in the United States and the only publicly traded firm of its kind \u2013 could be a boon for adoption.","\u201CWith increased regulatory clarity from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the timing is perfect to bring Canadians a transparent, efficient stablecoin,\u201D said Stablecorp CEO Alex McDougall last year.","Shortly after the collapse of FTX and Terra in 2022, the CSA issued guidance to crypto trading platforms, establishing a high bar for stablecoins or other pegged assets to receive listing. Stablecoins would require reserves of \u201Chighly liquid assets\u201D with \u201Cqualified custodians,\u201D and algorithmic stablecoins were completely ruled out.","The strict guidance contributed to Kraken and Coinbase delisting USDT and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) from their platforms and to Binance moving out of the country entirely.","Coinbase became the first international crypto exchange to gain registration as a \u201Crestricted dealer\u201D in Canada last month, however, signaling its sufficient compliance with regulators.","The company has often credited Canadian regulators with being cooperative with the crypto industry in ways that U.S. regulators are not. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, is currently suing Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance for securities law violations.","\u201CWe\u2019ve collaborated with Canadian banks, investment advisors, and pension funds to demonstrate our dedication to facilitating their successful navigation of the evolving digital asset realm,\u201D the company wrote last month."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 29, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CSA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase delisting USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$200,903.17","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$140 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"last month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Stablecorp","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alex McDougall","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Canada","Coinbase","Stablecoin"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
