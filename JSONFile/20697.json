This is in stark contrast to the all-time high, which was $22.57 billion back in May 2021. ","As there is more circulating supply now, we could see the market capital of Uniswap exceed the previous all-time high market cap. but still, have a lower trading price.","My prediction is that by the next crypto bull run, we might see a $40-50 billion dollar market cap. Uniswap with a trading price of around $40-50 depending on the circulating supply at the time. ","As you can see from the above price chart, Uniswap is still in a macro-downtrend and is yet to form any reassuring higher highs. ","Social analytics also suggest that Uniswap is currently trending across Twitter and most likely various other platforms.","Current price levels could be described as undervalued, and I would expect the price of UNI to chop between $4 and $9.50 for the remainder of the crypto winter. ",""],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$44.95","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"92%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$40","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UNI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$5 billion dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Uniswap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$9.50","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$927 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"13%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$22.57 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4.96 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"November 2020","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Uniswap"],"authors":["Jacob Bury"]}
