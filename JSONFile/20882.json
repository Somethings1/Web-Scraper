Both exchanges are in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC.","On Tuesday, in a separate document, the SEC mentioned Terraform Labs case is relevant and said that, Binance case is similar to its \u201Cso-called stablecoin\u201DÂ  BUSD and its staking-as-a-service, BNB vault and Simple Earns programs.","Last year, Coinbase came under scrutiny as the SEC continued its crackdown on the crypto industry. In 2023, there was renewed concern among Coinbase investors that tokens listed on the exchange could be considered securities under SEC rules, a change in classification that would bring a host of new regulatory requirements with it.","In October, Binance revealed its intentions to delist eight Binance USD (BUSD) trading pairs as part of a broader plan to withdraw full support for the stablecoin by 2024.
