This dominance is likely due to its first-mover advantage and security edge.","The spike in TVL in Ethereum layer-2 platforms could suggest rising demand for faster and cheaper transactions.

At the same time, they are secure since they derive their security from Ethereum.","The upcoming Dencun hard fork will further lower fees and improve efficiency. The update aims to make layer-2 transactions cheaper, laying the foundation for even more scalability advancements on Ethereum."],"entity":[{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$36.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3,700","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"13%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$2.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$15.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Arbitrum","Dencun","Ethereum"],"authors":["Dalmas Ngetich"]}
