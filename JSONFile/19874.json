Meanwhile, on its website, the crypto market data provider CryptoMarketCap shows that there are almost 19,000 \u201Ccryptos,\u201D while CoinGecko gives a number closer to 14,000.","In either case, the stat could be seen as a testament to the staying power that the number one cryptocurrency has managed to achieve versus other cryptos over the past five years.","Bitcoin dominance since 2018:","As pointed out by several of Lopp\u2019s followers, bitcoin\u2019s price is also up by about 350% during the same period, despite the increased competition.","\u201CAll those shitcoins and not one can effectively challenge dominance. It\u2019s only a matter of time before this starts to become obvious to all,\u201D one follower wrote.","On a similar note, another user argued that if ethereum (ETH) is taken out of the equation, bitcoin\u2019s dominance jumps to over 90%.","\u201CTake out Ethereum (which plans to try and centralize further by switching to proof of stake) & it\u2019s around 94%. And the others are so illiquid that one large holder dropping can eliminate the entire marketcap,\u201D Richard \u201CDick\u201D Whitman, wrote.","He went on to refer to what he called the \u2018Real Bitcoin Dominance Index,\u2019 which measures BTC\u2019s dominance without the proof-of-stake coins and currently sits at around 65%. (Ethereum is still a proof-of-work blockchain, while its transition to proof-of-stake is now estimated a \u201Cfew months after\u201D June.)
