On the other hand, he insisted that there is no doubt that bitcoin (BTC) is a digital property, and thus not subject to regulatory headaches.","Saylor, who has appeared on a recent episode of the UpOnly podcast, said that the most important thing for a long-term crypto investor to understand is the political status of a cryptoasset \u2014 i.e., is it a cryptocurrency, a crypto property, or crypto security.","\u201CAs far as I can see, Bitcoin is a crypto property and by property, it means it\u2019s viewed as a fair, common piece of property beyond the control of a company or a group of individuals,\u201D Saylor said, adding that it is pretty challenging to create a property.","Bitcoin was created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who released the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008. The coins are created through mining, which means there never was a pre-mine or an initial coin offering (ICO). Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, which is according to Saylor a \u201Cfair distribution.\u201D","Pointing these out, Saylor claimed that bitcoin can be easily classified as digital property, saying:","\u201CIt is pretty clear that of everything in the crypto universe the thing that is most likely to be deemed property in any given nation-state is Bitcoin.\u201D","However, he classified every coin that enables staking or uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism as digital security. ","\u201CIt has been explicitly stated by the regulators if there is a stake and it generates yield it\u2019s an investment contract and an investment contract is a security,\u201D Saylor added.","Recently, there have been some discussions that Ethereum is actually a security. That is because Ethereum was also originally funded through an ICO, which took place in 2014. At the time, users had the opportunity to exchange their BTC for ETH tokens, and more than 7m ETH tokens were sold in the first 12 hours.","According to Saylor, the problem with securities is that they are in a regulatory gray zone. \u201CIn order for you to invest in [securites], you have to be willing to accept the securities risk, the legal risk, the competitive risk, and the literal cyber security risk,\u201D he said.","This partly explains why Saylor, a bitcoin maximalist, has stayed away from ethereum despite all the recent growth around decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) which are mainly built on Ethereum.","Notably, Saylor\u2019s Microstrategy has continued its BTC buying spree despite all the volatility and dips. By the end of 2021, the company held approximately BTC 124,391, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of USD 3.75bn and an average purchase price of USD 30,159 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses, according to filings shared with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).","At 10:07 UTC, BTC is trading at USD 36,607. It\u2019s down 3% in a day and 12% in a week. ETH is changing hands at USD 2,444, having dropped 2% in a day and 21% in a week."," ","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 MicroStrategy to Keep Buying Bitcoin\n\u2013 MicroStrategy is Only HODLing Bitcoin, Says the CEO\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mining Energy Use \u2018Inconsequential,\u2019 \u2018Rapidly Becoming More Efficient\u2019 \u2013 Saylor\n\u2013 MicroStrategy\u2019s and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s Shares Now Compete with ETFs\n\n\u2013 MicroStrategy Insider Sales Hint Executives May Lack CEO\u2019s Conviction\n\u2013 This Is How Musk\u2019s and Saylor\u2019s Tweets Steer Bitcoin Price"],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"21%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Energy Use \u2018Inconsequential","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2008","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saylor\u2019s Tweets Steer Bitcoin Price","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Saylor\u2019s Microstrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ethereum","Investing","MicroStrategy"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
