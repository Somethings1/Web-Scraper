A further 200 billion tokens will be sold to the public across five remaining rounds that close on June 11.¬†","The funds from these additional tokens, which would otherwise be sold on decentralized (DEX) or centralized (CEX) exchanges after the claim, will now be used for liquidity and buy-back funds.","Token holders can stake on Ethereum to earn passive rewards.¬†","The team is currently working towards CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listing applications, while later DEX and CEX listings form part of the project roadmap.","But why exactly is everybody lapping up Dogeverse?","Let\u2019s go! üöÄ#DOGEVERSE raises over $10 Million! üí∞","Another incredible milestone ticked off! ‚úÖ","Join #Cosmo on his multi-chain adventures! üååüêï pic.twitter.com\/wNIPuHhplr","\u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 24, 2024","","It all started with Dogecoin (DOGE) back at the end of 2013. His adorable avatar didn\u2019t need much selling because it was based on a viral meme that virtually anyone with a social media account had seen before. (Wow! Such meme! Very crypto!)¬†","Doge was followed by Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), and DogWifHat (WIF). All of them reference original viral doge memes in some way, but none of them are inherently multi-chain.¬†","Dogecoin is its own proprietary network based on Bitcoin, and as another proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, it eats up a lot of electricity to validate blocks and mine DOGE.¬†","Since then, Dogecoin\u2019s competitors have either come from the most commercially important blockchain, Ethereum, or its nearest rival, Solana, both of which use less energy than Bitcoin and Dogecoin.¬†","Dogeverse is built on a multichain network spanning six chains, none of which deploy the PoW consensus mechanism. It is already live on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain,¬† Polygon, Base and Avalanche. A Solana rollout is planned soon.¬†","At the center of the Dogeverse is our four-legged friend Cosmo. Born from a supernova, Cosmo discovered he had a unique ability: the power to hyper-jump across universes.¬†","Now, Cosmo wants to share the chain-leaping fun with his owners.¬†","üåü Introducing #Cosmo, the remarkable #Doge born from stardust! üå†","As the ambassador of #DOGEVERSE, Cosmo symbolizes liberty, ingenuity, and unity.","Embark with him on an adventure across the #Crypto cosmos, breaking barriers and venturing into uncharted territories together. üöÄ pic.twitter.com\/wzLatjuLMu","\u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 21, 2024","","As any holder will tell you, meme coins are some of crypto\u2019s most volatile investments. This is because they have a tendency to exaggerate broader market-wide price movements.¬†","This means, for instance, that on days when investors are feeling risky and pumping Bitcoin, meme coins can often be found rallying harder. Conversely, a risk-off day in crypto may manifest itself in spiraling meme coin prices.¬†","Investors should be aware then, that meme coin performance is linked to crypto\u2019s perpetual news cycle. That said, two immediate price drivers will have a strong relationship to Cosmo\u2019s multi-chain Dogeverse.","The first is last Saturday\u2019s Bitcoin halving. The halving slashes Bitcoin mining rewards in half, effectively choking the issuance of new BTC and helping drive prices higher. Halvings have historically catalyzed bull runs, and already we can see Bitcoin has risen steadily (3%) since the halving.¬†","","The second is May 23. That\u2019s the SEC\u2019s first deadline to respond to the latest round of applications for an Ethereum ETF.¬†","Many analysts see the date as the start of a potential Ethereum gold rush, and with Ethereum being crypto\u2019s most commercially important blockchain, the whole ecosystem will benefit.","As will Layer 1 competitors like Solana and Avalanche and Layer 2s like Polygon, all of which are native to the Dogeverse.¬†¬†","So Cosmo is clean and green, with staking and seamless multi-chain fun.
