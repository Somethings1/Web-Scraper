The liquidators will continue to pursue all available opportunities to recover creditor assets worth billions in the coming months.","3AC co-founded by Zhu and Kyle Davies imploded in 2022 after leveraged bets went south leading to wider market losses and reduced investor sentiment. ","2022 was a year riddled with several industry collapses putting traders and investors on the edge as the bear market pressed on.","Apart from 3AC, the Terra Network also suffered a similar fate causing billions of losses before the implosion of FTX capped the series of unfortunate events in November. "],"entity":[{"type":"Kyle Davies","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kelly Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Terra Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Su Zhu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"British Virgin Islands","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.14 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Teneo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Singapore Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"British Virgin Islands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Davies","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Changi Airport","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Three Arrows Capital"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
