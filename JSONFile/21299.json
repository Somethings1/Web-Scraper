One of those investors included the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), which disclosed a $162 million allocation to the ETFs this week.","According to Scaramucci, institutions are dipping their toes into BTC before it becomes part of a \u201Ctotal tactical asset allocation index.\u201D","Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan backed this view on Tuesday, predicting that institutions could begin to devote between 1% and 5% of their portfolios to BTC as they tentatively expose client funds to the asset.","When asked why Bitcoin would attract such widespread adoption, Scaramucci said he was in the \u201Cdigital gold category\u201D \u2013 a subset of investors who see the asset\u2019s primary use case as a store of value rather than a medium of exchange. MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor falls into this camp, having previously called Bitcoin\u2019s use case as currency \u201Ca distraction.\u201D","\u201CSometimes when you\u2019re early you get a lot of bumps and scrapes, but I think it pays to be early in Bitcoin, and I think we\u2019re still early in Bitcoin,\u201D he concluded.","Earlier this year, Scaramucci predicted that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 per coin by the end of 2025."],"entity":[{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Matt Hougan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1000","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$162 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"State of Wisconsin Investment Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Scaramucci","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$170,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Scaramucci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Skybridge Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anthony Scarmucci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
