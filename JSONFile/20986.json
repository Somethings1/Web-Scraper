Despite the recently released email, no further explanation was given by Bitpanda for their sudden user offboarding.","Bitpanda\u2019s Netherlands closing will happen only six months after the European Union\u2019s (EU) Markets in Crypto Asset Regulation (MiCA) came into effect in June 2023, prompting a wave of regulatory change across the international political union. That same month, crypto exchange Binance shut down its Dutch operations following its failure to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) from local regulators.","We regret to announce that Binance is leaving the Dutch market as we have been unable to register as a VASP with the Dutch regulator.","We continue to be committed to working collaboratively with regulators around the world and are additionally focused on getting our business\u2026","\u2014 Binance (@binance) June 16, 2023","","\u201CWe continue to be committed to working collaboratively with regulators around the world and are additionally focused on getting our business ready to be fully MiCA compliant,\u201D Binance posted to its account on X at the time.","Similarly, New York-based crypto exchange Gemini halted all its operations in the Netherlands in late 2023, citing regulatory compliance issues.","\u201CGemini continues to be committed to working collaboratively with regulators around the world,\u201D an email from the company read.","At the time, Gemini assisted Dutch users in transferring their funds to fellow crypto exchange Bitvavo. Currently, it is unclear whether Bitpanda has provided any recommendations on how users in the Netherlands should handle their digital assets going forward.","Following the news, one Reddit user suggested the Amsterdam-based exchange as an alternative to Bitpanda.","\u201CBitvavo from the Netherlands is a strong competitor and much cheaper than Bitpanda broker,\u201D the Redditor said.","Another posted that they \u201Cwould like to know\u201D a more detailed reason for Bitpanda\u2019s Dutch closing and a comparably \u201Cgood\u201D and \u201Csafe\u201D alternative app for those based in the Netherlands. Many Dutch investors are seeking an answer to the question of whether, and when, Bitpanda, Gemini, and Binance will be able to return to the Dutch market."],"entity":[{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Netherlands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Amsterdam","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Redditor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the Netherlands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VASP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June 16, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitpanda","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitpanda","Crypto Regulation","EU regulations"],"authors":["Julia Smith"]}
