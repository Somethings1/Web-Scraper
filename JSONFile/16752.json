He allegedly sold over 2,000 videos and had ties to 303 virtual currency accounts, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia.","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) funded the bulk of the operation, according to the complaint against the man filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Customers allegedly sent the cryptocurrencies as payment for videos or could upload their own. Their video submissions had to follow \u201Cspecific rules,\u201D though. As detailed extensively in the complaint, the videos had to be explicitly \u201Cobscene.\u201D","\u201CThe types of crimes described in this indictment are the most disgusting I\u2019ve encountered in 30 years of law enforcement,\u201D said Don Fort, chief of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigation team (IRS-CI), in a press release. \u201CIt is a special kind of evil to prey on and profit from the pain of others.\u201D","Federal agents discovered DarkScandals while investigating the Welcome to Video case last year. That operation led to hundreds of arrests, the seizure of hundreds of thousands of videos and the dismantling of what was deemed the \u201Clargest darknet child pornography website\u201D by investigators at the time.","It also led investigators straight to DarkScandals, the complaint said. \u201CA subsequent review of a Washington, D.C.-based 'Welcome to Video' customer\u2019s virtual currency records lead to the discovery of the DarkScandals sites.\u201D","The case serves as another reminder that cryptocurrencies are a double-edged sword for criminals. On the one hand, transactions cannot be blocked by a regulated third party like a bank or payment processor; on the other hand, they leave a trail of crumbs for investigators that is difficult to obscure.","Agents with IRS and Homeland Security Investigations traced 303 digital currency transactions in the course of this latest investigation. The IRS had used Chainalysis\u2019 transaction tracing software in the Welcome to Video investigation, but a spokesperson for Chainalysis declined to comment on this most recent one.","\u201CIf you thought you were anonymous, think again,\u201D Fort said.","U.S. investigators worked in partnership with the Dutch National Police, Europol and the German Federal Criminal Police in parallel investigations, according to DOJ.","Prosecutors are seeking to charge the man on nine counts and seize the operation\u2019s digital currency holdings. It was not immediately clear if he is in custody. A spokesperson for the U.S Attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment."],"entity":[{"type":"Fort","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Michael R.M.","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2012","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dutch National Police","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europol","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Don Fort","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"IRS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Homeland Security Investigations","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dark","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"German Federal Criminal Police","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the District of Columbia","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"D.C.","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin","Chainalysis","Law Enforcement","HSI","IRS-CI","darknet"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
