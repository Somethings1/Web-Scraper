Today marks exactly thirteen years from the event, and the crypto community is celebrating Bitcoin becoming a teenager (Happy Bitcoin Birthday!).","Today is also one more thing: it is the fourth Proof of Keys Day (PoK), an event meant to examine whether Bitcoin users really own their coins or not, which is led by the famous \u2018not your keys, not your coins\u2019 adage.Â ","\u201CYou can consider Proof of Keys a combat readiness drill. Hopefully, it will help prevent further annoying skirmishes with those who despise individuals empowered with monetary sovereignty,\u201D the event\u2019s official website explains.","The event was first introduced by Trace Mayer, a Bitcoin advocate and host of the Bitcoin knowledge podcast. The idea behind this day is simple: it aims to motivate users to self-custody their private keys.","\u201CThe idea of Proof of Keys is to show to the [crypto] community that there is still control of our funds,\u201D Mayer said in an announcement video in 2018. \u201CLots of new people have come into the community\u2026 I think it\u2019s important for us to declare and redeclare our monetary sovereignty on a regular basis\u201D.","Bitcoin private keys are randomly generated strings of numbers and letters that function as a password to a wallet. These keys grant asymmetric power to individuals by giving them utter ownership and control over data, which can be bitcoin(s) or a text message. In technical terms, it is practically impossible for a hacker to get into a Bitcoin wallet and steal its funds without keys.Â ","Bitcoin advocates support the event as it promotes Bitcoin\u2019s core ethos of decentralization. If a large number of Bitcoin holders store their coins in an exchange, it can pose a risk to the Bitcoin network by endangering a large share of coins \u2013 as centralized entities are subject to hack and exploitation.Â ","Furthermore, Bitcoin was created as a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment system. \u201CWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party,\u201D Nakamoto said in Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper.Â ","Therefore, allowing a third party to store someone\u2019s private keys is against Bitcoin\u2019s ideals of monetary sovereignty.Â ","Meanwhile, Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin Association has been one of the first to celebrate PoK day, saying it is \u201Ca great day to withdraw your coins to a wallet you own and control.\u201D","Happy Genesis Block day! Today, Bitcoin is 13 years old. It\u2019s also a great day to withdraw your coins to a wallet you own and control! #ProofofKeys ðŸ”‘","Notably, Trace Mayer, the initiator of the event, has been out of sight for quite some time now after he was heavily criticized for allegedly shilling a coin in 2020.","Yes, it's true, he tried to shill it to me but I wouldn't listen and instead I told him if he's right, he should buy it & not tell anyone, because if he's wrong, he'll destroy a reputation built over a decade for a pointless scam.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Predictions for 2022\n\u2013 Crypto Adoption in 2022: What to Expect?\n\n\u2013 7 Popular Bitcoin Lightning Network Wallets for 2022\n\u2013 Vitalik Buterin Over the Past Decade: How Right or Wrong Was He?\n\n\u2013 Web 3.0 Wars are Becoming Personal as Jack Dorsey Draws the Decentralization Line\n\u2013 I \u2018Orange Pilled\u2019 a Dozen Nocoiners in a Week: Here Are the Questions They Had About Bitcoin"],"entity":[{"type":"Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u2018Orange Pilled\u2019 a Dozen Nocoiners","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u2013 Crypto Adoption","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January 3, 2009","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mayer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Satoshi Nakamoto","Wallet"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
