The halving could potentially reduce the daily supply of Bitcoin to around 12 million.","Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin then asked Lee for his thoughts on whether individuals who traditionally purchased Bitcoin through exchanges such as Coinbase would continue to do so in the wake of the expected approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\n\u201CA lot of the younger generation of investors want to be my keys, my coin, so they want to own the private keys,\u201D Lee said.\n\nThe older generation, however, will still likely purchase Bitcoin through public markets and public proxies, Lee predicted.\n\n\u201CAs you know, there\u2019s a generation of folks that would rather allocate through their 401(k), or through public markets or liquid assets,\u201D Lee said. \u201CIf you look at some of the percentage of assets held by those over age 50, it\u2019s close to 76% of all wealth in America. It\u2019s over $120 trillion. So I think that cohort is still going to prefer to own it through public markets and public proxies.\u201D\n\nLee isn\u2019t the only analyst with a $150,000 prediction for Bitcoin.","Robert Kiyosaki, author of \u201CRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201D recently expressed his excitement at the impending approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on an X post, writing, \u201CBITCOIN ETF. Yay. Glad I bought years ago. Bitcoin to $150k soon.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$150,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Robert Kiyosaki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"76%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Tom Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$500,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$150k","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Head of Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Andrew Ross Sorkin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$120 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency","Market","Tom Lee"],"authors":["Brian Yue"]}
