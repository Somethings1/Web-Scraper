It gave them anonymity and freedom from the oversight of intermediaries present in traditional payment systems. ","The individuals reportedly used the same aliases across multiple dark web marketplaces, including Silk Road 1, AlphaBay, and Hansa.","In addition, the FBI and ED have continued to collaborate closely on the matter, with the ED sharing important documents related to the investigation.","The ED carried out an additional operation on the arrested Parvinder.
