Their credits represent a range of franchises, spanning AAA games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Star Wars: Jedi Survivor to films like The Batman, Avengers, and Blade Runner.","However, the team went far beyond the studio, with the involvement of the game\u2019s fanbase having a significant impact on its development.","Over 250,000 fans have co-created the storyline and lore of the Star Wars-esque franchise, culminating in an accompanying trilogy of books, comics, and another game to be revealed later, according to a report from VentureBeat.","This has resulted in a real community with genuine investment in the product, born out of their shared passion, rewarded with in-game assets for their engagement.","\u201CNaturally no first attempt at something new is perfect, but it\u2019s been amazing getting to create a sci-fi universe with the fans in a way that\u2019s never been attempted before. I\u2019ve gotten to fulfill a lot of my childhood dreams, working on Star Wars, Blade Runner and Marvel movies to name a few, but there\u2019s little that compares to being able to interact and build with the fans from day one,\u201D comments Chief Creative Officer Jon McCoy.","Play-to-own titles leverage blockchain technology and develop non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to provide users with full ownership of in-game assets, such as characters, items, or land.","Something that Co-Founder Mark Meyers has attributed to the community built behind the project.","\u201CInvolving the community early on and rewarding them for their participation with in-game goods that they actually own benefits publishers, developers and players, by reducing publisher ad spend, providing the feedback developers need and getting the players better games,\u201D said Meyers.","Cracks are emerging in the dominant Free-to-Play model of today. The publishing costs of games are increased by spending tens of billions of dollars on advertising to draw in new players. These costs are then passed on to players through progressively more costly in-game purchases.","Something Roosendaal seeks to correct, saying \u201CIt\u2019s crazy to think that players are spending over $100 billion and 100\u2019s of hours of their spare time each year, gathering in-game items they don\u2019t actually own.\u201D","This may just be what the gaming community needs. Increasingly present monetization has caused the gaming industry to stray away from consumer engagement in favor of profits. ","Dominant publishers are churning out products designed to rinse players of their money and be discarded with annual releases, forcing those committed to the franchise into a worthless gameplay loop.","Play-to-earn is the solution; community-driven decisions and ownership will become the new standard for global entertainment, establishing a transactional relationship between the publisher and the player rather than a parasitic one. "],"entity":[{"type":"Hollywood","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mark Meyers","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Loren Roosendaal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Marvel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United Arab Emirates (UAE","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Star Wars","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Activision","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Avengers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Warner Bros.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Disney\u2019s AAA Studios Mark Meyers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jon McCoy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Galactic Entertainment Publishing","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Galactic Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Meyers","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"tens of billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Disney","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Gaming","NFTs"],"authors":["Harvey Hunter"]}
