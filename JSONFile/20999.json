Meanwhile, the company also made note of coming \u201Cfractionalization\u201D, which may suggest non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but it makes no mention of them. ","At an Investor Day event, the firm\u2019s Chief Executive Jamie Iannone said that the firm will promote new businesses avenues, including a digital platform named the eBay Vault.","Details of its digital wallet appear to be relatively scant thus far. But there are clues that suggest NFTs could well play a part.","Last year, eBay began allowing users to trade NFTs on its platform. The firm built its trading empire on providing a marketplace for physical collectibles. As such, a \u201Cdigital wallet\u201D could well be little more than a secure, software-based digital home for credit and debit card information.","But it could also be a wallet capable of storing \u2013 and displaying \u2013 customer NFTs. A further hint came in a promotional YouTube video entitled \u201CAnnouncing the eBay Vault.\u201D","Although the video contained no direct mention of crypto or NFTs, in one slide, the firm noted that \u201Cin the future,\u201D \u201Cfractionalization\u201D would be added.","In the NFT world, fractionalization can refer to the digital ownership of a token, whereby the digital rights of a single NFT are broken up into small pieces \u2013 fractions. This makes it possible for more than one person to \u201Cown\u201D an individual NFT. If, for instance, Tommy owns half of Rare NFT #1, it is also possible for Judy and Paul to own a quarter each of the same NFT.","A digital wallet could also refer to a software innovation that allows customers to store their private keys on a platform and pay in crypto on a digital marketplace \u2013 such as eBay. But, again, there is nothing in the eBay materials to suggest that this is the case.","Speculation had been intense leading up to the event, with many expecting a major reveal on the crypto pay front. But it appears that the platform is not quite yet ready to take the plunge.","Instead, Iannone stated:","\u201COver the past two years, we have fundamentally changed the trajectory of our marketplace. We see incredibly compelling growth potential in this market and believe it is our opportunity to win by sharpening our focus and continuing to create value through a tech-led re-imagination of eBay.\u201D","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 eBay\u2019s Crypto Teaser\n\u2013 eBay Still Looking at Crypto Payments, Mulls NFTs\n\n\u2013 Goldman Sachs Leaves Russia, Reportedly Set to Increase Crypto Focus\n\u2013 Here is JPMorgan\u2019s \u2018Metaverse Strategy\u2019 Advice for Businesses\n\n\u2013 Gustav Klimt\u2019s \u2018The Kiss\u2019 Masterpiece is Selling as 10,000 NFTs\n\u2013 Crypto Wallet Trends in 2022: More Privacy, Security, Features, and Choice"],"entity":[{"type":"second quarter of the financial year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Payments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tommy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"eBay Vault","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Iannone","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jamie Iannone","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Judy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Paul","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mulls NFTs\n\n\u2013 Goldman Sachs Leaves Russia","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gustav Klimt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Wallet Trends","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Cryptocurrency","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Wallet"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
