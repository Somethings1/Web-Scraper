This update provides a Bitcoin price prediction in light of recent financial shifts.","BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, a spot bitcoin ETF trading on Nasdaq, experienced a noticeable decline in popularity, according to preliminary data from Farside Investors.","For the first time since its launch on January 11, IBIT failed to attract any new investments, ending its 71-day streak of continuous inflows. This trend was echoed by seven out of ten similar funds.","Meanwhile, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF saw modest inflows of $5.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively.","In contrast, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC faced significant withdrawals, with $130.4 million exiting the fund, culminating in a net outflow of $120.6 million\u2014the largest since April 17.","Despite a strong start with heavy initial investment, the overall enthusiasm for these bitcoin ETFs has cooled off this month, dampening the previous momentum in the bitcoin market.","Hong Kong is gearing up to launch Bitcoin and Ether ETFs by the end of April, aiming to position itself as a major digital asset hub. This move is set to challenge the dominance of the United States, where similar funds have accumulated $56 billion.","However, Hong Kong faces challenges, including lower brand recognition compared to U.S. giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, and it must also navigate local demand and regulatory hurdles.","Hong Kong is set to follow in the footsteps of the US by listing a batch of cryptocurrency ETFs, providing a window on whether the city is making progress on fashioning a hub for digital assets https:\/\/t.co\/5FngKs7daj","\u2014 Bloomberg (@business) April 23, 2024","","Unlike U.S. ETFs that use cash redemptions, Hong Kong plans to utilize in-kind procedures to boost efficiency. Despite these efforts, the overarching cryptocurrency ban in China remains a significant obstacle.","Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETF recently secured a record $40 million investment from financial advisors at Legacy Wealth Management and United Capital Management of Kansas. This marks the largest single investment in a Bitcoin fund to date.","The investment represents 6% and 5% of their respective portfolios, signaling growing confidence among traditional investors.","#Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin #ETF draws $40M in largest single investment from advisers :\nFinancial advisers Legacy Wealth Management and United Capital Management of Kansas have each invested $20 million in shares of the Fidelity Wise Origin #Bitcoin Fund (#FBTC).","Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/TehT4KTYjl","\u2014 TOBTC (@_TOBTC) April 23, 2024","","Despite this, there is concern over the low public participation in Bitcoin ETFs. Although Fidelity\u2019s fund is the second largest, boasting assets over $10 billion, demand is waning, as evidenced by recent net outflows.","This scenario underscores the rising institutional interest in Bitcoin, while also highlighting the challenges that hinder broader ETF adoption.","Today\u2019s technical outlook for Bitcoin (BTC\/USD)Â  indicates a slight increase in its price to $64,165, up by 0.10%. Bitcoin\u2019s current pivot point is at $65,825, a critical juncture that suggests potential shifts in market dynamics.","The immediate resistance levels are at $67,687, $69,232, and $71,068. Should BTC surpass these thresholds, it could signal stronger bullish momentum. Conversely, support levels are identified at $63,654, $61,387, and $59,746.","A drop below these could intensify bearish trends. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 38, suggesting that Bitcoin is nearing oversold conditions, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $65,223 serves as near-term resistance.","Overall, Bitcoin\u2019s market stance appears bearish below the pivot point of $65,825.","99Bitcoins,Â a trailblazer in digital education, innovates cryptocurrency learning with its \u2018learn-to-earn\u2019 system.
