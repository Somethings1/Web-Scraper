However, using the TruStake liquid staking solution, fund investors can access yield consistnetly higher than Lido\u2019s 5% average while maintaining the freedom to sell their tokens at any time.","TruFin has already partnered with Balacner and Chainlink to maximize the liquidity of the TruMATIC token.","The fund takes advantage of the Polygon AggLayer, which aggregates zero-knowledge proofs from all connected blockchains, boosting liqudiidty and transaction speed while maximizing the fund\u2019s operational efficiency. It will first become available to investors in the United Kingdom following relevant registrations and regulatory approvals.","\u201CLaser Digital Asset Management aims to transform DeFi investment opportunities into investable TradFi solutions,\u201D said Sebastien Guglietta, Head of Laser Digital Asset Management.","\u201CLeveraging TruFin technology and its integration with Polygon\u2019s AggLayer, we are making Polygon-Matic digital asset investment accessible, in the most secure, and efficient way for institutional investors.\u201D","Colin Butler, Global Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon, added that getting institutional investors involved with staking would boost the overall security of the Polygon network.","Polygon is one of the leading layer 2 scaling networks for Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 the largest smart contract blockchain by volume and market cap.","Thanks to Ethereum\u2019s recent Denucun upgrade, the cost of \u201Crollups\u201D on Polygon \u2013 batches of transactions that are later settled to the Ethereum blockchain \u2013 is expected to drastically fall following the latter\u2019s Feijoa update. It\u2019s also a slight boon for Polygon staking, since Ethereum L1 settlement costs became slightly cheaper.","While liquid staking is DeFi\u2019s most popular use case, prominent developers like Vitalik Buterin have warned that the phenomenon is pushing networks like Ethereum toward centralization."],"entity":[{"type":"Matic","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Laser Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nomura","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"5.94%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"TruFin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Laser Digital Asset Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Global Head of Institutional Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sebastien Guglietta","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Balacner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lido","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Polygon\u2019s AggLayer","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cryptonews","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Head of Laser Digital Asset Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MATIC","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United Kingdom","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Colin Butler","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Polygon","Staking"],"authors":["Andrew Throuvalas"]}
