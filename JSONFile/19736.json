Currently available only via its official presale at $0.026 per token, although this price is expected to rise as it progresses through the fundraising.","The token will power the entire ecosystem and offer its holders long-term rewards in the form of Power Staking.","Additionally, TUK will exist alongside fiat to ease the entry barrier for the unbanked.","10\/","Stay tuned for more such updates on EVs and Clean Energy.","\u2014 eTukTuk (@eTukTukio) January 17, 2024","","Among other commenters, three analysts have recently discussed this project, its potential, and possible price targets. Notably, all three have indicated that the TUK token and the entire ecosystem have a significant long-term potential.","Read on to learn what they had to say.","Cilinix Crypto opined that this is \u201Ca real project\u201D with \u201Creal utility\u201D and potential value.","","\u201COther presales really rely on FOMO and hype to do well,\u201D he said. eTukTuk relies on its platform, instead \u2013 the actual product.","That said, while eTukTuk is \u201Cdoing great\u201D and is raising money, some amount of hype is still necessary, Clinix Crypto argued.","This presale \u201Ccould actually have potential,\u201D he argued, depending on whether they deliver a product and how much it ends up being used.","\u201CThe big strategy for me with this presale is to hold it long-term.\u201D","This is due to the yield percentage, which stands above 500% a year. Also, staking increases rewards.","The token will do particularly well if there is more hype before the launch ends, he added. If they do well at launch, then both short-term and long-term strategies are beneficial.","The project\u2019s social media sites are active, regularly updated, and have notable engagement. Furthermore, eTukTuk already has \u201Ca ton\u201D of investors and partners.","Cilinix Crypto also noted that eTukTuk is creating a play-to-earn (P2E) game, thus incorporating many of the large narratives in the product: AI, blockchain, and gaming.","Michael Wrubel went deeper into the elements that will comprise eTukTuk\u2019s ecosystem. These include an affordable electric vehicle, an AI-powered Driver App, a charging network, a token, and a game. Notably, they will all exist to solve a problem (as described above).","Going through the tokencomics and project info, Wrubel opined that all the ecosystem components intertwine and will be useful long-term, \u201Cespecially with what we\u2019re seeing with regulations all around the world.\u201D","As for TUK, it can be purchased with fiat, USDT, or BNB, and connected to an Ethereum wallet. This is a part of its multichain approach.","Therefore, holders will benefit as the ecosystem grows, says Wrubel. It will help the token\u2019s value increase in the long term.","He noted that the countries where this ecosystem is the most necessary \u2013 such as certain Asian countries \u2013 are a lot more populated than the rest of the world.","That said, eTukTuk will start in Sri Lanka, a country with a population of over 22 million and a region where tuk-tuks are immensely popular.","And while most companies focus on four-wheel cars, the largest sector of the market, Wrubel said, are two- and three-wheel vehicles.","Therefore, eTukTuk\u2019s targeting a much larger and more affordable market.","","TUK is a 10x potential crypto, said Jacob Crypto Bury in his recent video.","","Discussing price prediction per Techopedia, he found that TUK could attract more users and reach $0.075 by the end of 2024.","By the end of 2025, this could go up to $0.17 (7x), as well as $0.88 by 2030 (30x), according to Jacob.","Stating that he is bullish on the project, Jacob added that he has \u201Cnever seen anything like it before.\u201D He complemented eTukTuk\u2019s use case, the fundamentals, and utility.","He also noted the big names in the crypto space joining the project as partners and investors.
