Either way @cz_binance has some explaining to do pic.twitter.com\/XyiiqCo5ZQ","In their defense, some noted that the swastika means \u201Cwell-being\u201D in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit. In Buddhism, the swastika symbolizes the feet, or the footprints, of the Buddha, and is commonly used in Hindu countries.Â ","\u201CIf you ever spend some time in Buddhist or Hindu countries, you\u2019ll see variations of this symbol on every corner. People claiming to be multi-cultural, yet view everything through a Eurocentric eye,\u201D a Twitter user said.Â ","in their defense\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/TaudfyBSdi","However, in the West, the symbol is primarily recognized for its use by the Nazi party, responsible for the genocide of European Jews during World War II.","\u201CYeah, but when a symbol is used for hate, killing, torturing etc it carries a meaning bigger than the original one. The least we could do is avoiding using, in particular in a context not related to religion. It is hard to believe it was an innocent mistake on Hitler\u2019s birthday,\u201D another Twitter user said.Â ","Known as hashflags, which are simply hashtags followed by emojis, these are enabled on Twitter for specific occasions or events. However, companies can also create their own, but they will have to pay for it \u2013 which can cost more than USD 1m.Â \n____","Swastikas are a religious sign of good fortune, toothbrush mustaches are a trademark of Charlie Chaplin, and \"Adolf\" is an ancient Germanic name meaning \"Noble Wolf.\" Or, rather than fighting for cursed hate symbols, you could just\u2026 not?
