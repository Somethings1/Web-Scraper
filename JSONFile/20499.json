Lubin asserted that the SEC\u2019s actions, such as reclassifying Ether as a security without transparent communication, were designed to instill fear and doubt, potentially driving cryptocurrency companies offshore.","\u201CThe SEC appears to have reclassified Ether as a security without telling anybody that that\u2019s the case,\u201D Lubin said. \u201CThey are going about a strategic series of enforcement actions rather than open discourse and clear rulemaking.\u201D","Central to Lubin\u2019s critique is the suspicion surrounding the SEC\u2019s motives, particularly regarding its recent enforcement actions against Ethereum. Lubin suggested that the impending decision to approve Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has spurred the SEC\u2019s intensified scrutiny, fearing the potential influx of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem.","üó£Ô∏è Ethereum developer firm Consensys managed by Joe Lubin has filed a lawsuit against the SEC over its \u201Coverzealous regulation\u201D around the Ethereum blockchain.#CryptoNewshttps:\/\/t.co\/1MsgbSROXn","\u2014 Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2024","","\u201CWe believe that there\u2019s a flurry of activity designed to enable them to say that their action wasn\u2019t capricious in the very likely event that they deny the Ether spot ETFs,\u201D The Ethereum co-founder explained.","In Lubin\u2019s view, the SEC\u2019s reluctance to embrace Ethereum\u2019s advancements in scalability and usability stems from a desire to maintain the status quo, fearing the transformative impact decentralized finance (DeFi) could have on the banking industry.","\u201CI think they\u2019re concerned that so much attention and capital will flow to our ecosystem, considering it is improving enormously in terms of scalability and usability,\u201D he added.","Lubin further argued that the SEC\u2019s apprehension towards innovation reflects a broader reluctance to adapt to emerging technologies, potentially hindering the growth of the cryptocurrency sector.","Additionally, Lubin cautioned against the SEC\u2019s attempts to classify platforms like Coinbase and MetaMask\u2019s wallets as broker-dealers, warning that such actions could set a dangerous precedent and stifle innovation across the technology sector.","\u201CWe\u2019re at odds over whether we should register MetaMask as a broker-dealer,\u201D he said. \u201CShould ever MetaMask user have to register their wallet as a broker-dealer, it\u2019s chilling.\u201D","","The SEC recently decided to delay its ruling on the proposed Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The new deadline for the decision is July 5, 2024. The SEC stated additional time is required to review the proposed rule change and the associated issues thoroughly.","Similarly, Franklin Templeton\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF also faces an extended delay, with the SEC pushing the decision deadline to June 11, 2024.","Several other issuers, including BlackRock, 21Shares with Ark, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton, have filed applications for Ethereum ETFs, adding to the market\u2019s anticipation.","Market analysts had initially speculated that the SEC would reach a final decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications during May, coinciding with deadlines for various asset managers\u2019 submissions.","The recent delays announced by the SEC have dampened these expectations, however. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart expressed skepticism, suggesting that the current round of Ether ETF applications might face rejection, altering the landscape for Ethereum investment options in the US."],"entity":[{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 25, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Joseph Lubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June 11, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Joe Lubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FT Live\u2019s Crypto and Digital Assets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Invesco Galaxy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hashdex","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Ethereum as a security","SEC"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
