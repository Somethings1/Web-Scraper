It dropped less than 1% to $34,816,770, according to CryptoSlam.","NFT buyers are up 2% over the past day. Sellers are down 8% and transactions 11%.","Only two of the top ten collections per sales volume have decreased over the past 24 hours. The popular, ERC404-based Pandora fell 30% to 4.2 million, while DMarket dropped 5% to $757,178.","Meanwhile, Art Blocks has had another good day. The collection is the day\u2019s bigger gainer: its sales volume is up 588% to $774,173.","Moonbirds, with a rise of 304% to $690,352, is the second-best performer. The increase led it into the top ten collections, now sitting in 10th place.","Popular crypto investigators ZachXBT and Coffeezilla have accused YouTuber Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji, aka KSI, of conducting several pump-and-dump schemes.","KSI reopened his crypto-related Twitter account on Tuesday. He posted his first tweet on this account since November 2022.","And this wasn\u2019t exactly welcomed news, based on the comments.","And one investigator was waiting. ZachXBT commented that KSI will share \u201Cgarbage again.\u201D","","","ZachXBT went on to share projects the YouTuber had posted on his account, including XCAD Network (XCAD) and the NFT-focused Ethernity Chain (ERN).","After \u2018praising\u2019 a project, he\u2019d sell the coins within hours or days. For example, hours after tweeting that he was bullish on EARN, he sold $349,571 of it.","KSI posts on 3-20-21 at 12:08 PM UTC saying","\u201C2 NFT coins I'm VERY bullish on SUPER ERN\u201D","Just hours after that post KSI proceeds to sell ~$349K worth of ERN","0xdd7a79dadf3ac202c2caa13e7cdd7e48153189b0f7be332c1a3c8686a9f10803\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/odGfiqROc9","\u2014 ZachXBT (@zachxbt) February 14, 2024",""," ","When contacted by Coffeezilla, KSI replied that he is still \u201CHODL gang\u201D for those coins \u2013 meaning, somebody who does not sell. But as to why he did sell XCAD, for example, KSI said that he wanted to make more money elsewhere to buy more XCAD, but failed.","KSI went on to say that he \u201Cdidn\u2019t have any malicious intent in trying to scam etc\u201D and that he wished \u201Che was an evil genius that would pump and dump at the right time etc,\u201D suggesting that he wasn\u2019t clever but bad at investing.","Called out for inconsistencies, KSI claimed that he thought he was being \u201Ctrolled.\u201D Every time he\u2019d tweet something, the opposite would happen. Hence, he said, he decided to \u201Ctweet the opposite\u201D of what he \u201Cwas actually doing.\u201D","","In other NFT news, the famous ERC-404 token Pandora launched on February 2. In less than two weeks since its launch, it has hit $86,778,798, according to CryptoSlam.","This is a notable rise. For context, Uncategorized Ordinals are in second place per sales volume in the past 30 days with $44,045,731.","This means that Pandora has nearly doubled that number in less than double that time.","Other metrics are a different story, though. Uncategorized Ordinals have significantly more transactions, buyers, and sellers, despite the drop in numbers.","Meanwhile, as reported, the popular ERC-404 token recorded $190 million in trading volume just a week after its launch.","Notably, 50% of these NFTs were retained in the wallets since the initial purchase without selling. Blockchain analytics firm Nansen.ai described this as a \u201Cquite impressive\u201D rate for a new project.","But zooming out to the all-time best performers, Pandora still has ways to go.","The top ten group is populated with some of the world-famous collections, including Axie Infinity and Yuga Labs\u2019 collections.","Pandora is currently in the 80th place.","Pudgy Penguins is an 8,888-piece strong, Ethereum-based NFT collection first launched in July 2021.
