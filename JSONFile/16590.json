This worked in tandem with a prior London upgrade that implemented a mechanism that burned a portion of transactions fees (the base fee), this effectively removed ETH from circulation and caused deflationary pressure.","Dencun, the most recent upgrade, implemented \"danksharding,\" which improved block storage and made layer-2 networks cheaper.","Ether was a deflationary asset following the Merge, with the total supply of the token dropping from 120.491 million to 120.097 million since September 2022. However, the total amount of fees burned decoupled from network activity following Dencun, meaning that the natural increase in supply is outpacing the amount burned in fees. Ether's supply has thus increased by 400,000 tokens since April.","CORRECTION (18:43 UTC): Fixes spelling on \"danksharding.\"","Edited by Stephen Alpher."],"entity":[{"type":"Stephen Alpher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"September 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dencun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Dencun","London Fork","The Merge","Deflation"],"authors":["Oliver Knight"]}
