It\u2019s backed by prominent cryptocurrency firms including Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital, Bitmain and Initialized Capital. It also has an academic stamp of approval, having been designed by Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University.","","","The blockchain is usually grouped with other so-called Ethereum killers, or blockchains designed to solve the scalability problems that have plagued the second-largest blockchain since inception. While positioned to steal market share from Ethereum, Avalanche also has been billed as a way to complement and connect \u2013 rather than strictly compete  \u2013 with its forbear. ","","","Avalanche has three \u201Cdefault chains,\u201D including the so-called \u201Ccontract chain\u201D that supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine and its Solidity coding language. It\u2019s this chain that was part of this week\u2019s issue. ","","","You can read a full accounting of the problem that arose. But in short, in order to boost transaction throughput, Avalanche\u2019s three chains remain separate and distinct from each other, each performing within a set range of transaction-types, up until the moment an asset has to hop over to another chain. That process was placed under an incredible strain, following the launch of a new decentralized money market called Pangolin. ","","","An atypical amount of users and volume created an atypical amount of blocks to be processed. This, O\u2019Grady notes, triggered a bug that was creating false cross-chain \u201Cmints.\u201D In O\u2019Grady\u2019s words: \u201CThis caused some validators to accept some invalid mint transactions, while the rest of the network refused to honor these transactions and stalled the [contract]-chain.\u201D","","","Importantly, no double-spends occurred. \u201CThe bug did not affect regular transactions, coin transfers, asset transfers, coin destruction, or smart contract invocations. Avalanche never allowed any user to successfully send the same funds to two recipients,\u201D O\u2019Grady wrote.","","","A read of the issue was ready just hours after the initial issue, though a fix was harder to come by. Given Avalanche\u2019s decentralized nature, it would be impossible to get all the nodes to collude and rollback problematic transactions. ","","","Instead, as O\u2019Grady writes, a solution was found through incremental deployment of a patch \u2013 basically the way any software is updated. ","","","Blockchains are complex things, built by human beings, but run by machines. An issue that was small enough to bypass during an initial inspection can snowball as a network grows. In Avalanche\u2019s case, the bug didn\u2019t bring down the network but it did pour ice water over some of the boasts made about the network\u2019s ability to handle high-throughput prior to launch.","","","AVAX, the blockchain\u2019s token, is trading hands at around $41.20, down from $53 on Feb. 11 when the problem occurred. ",""],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$53","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ava Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$41.20","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitmain","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"O'Grady","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cornell University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Feb. 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AVAX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Emin Gün Sirer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Patrick O'Grady","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Bug","Avalanche"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
