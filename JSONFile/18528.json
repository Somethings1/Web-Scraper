This phenomenon signals a potential need for enhanced investor education and awareness in the region.","Hong Kong\u2019s evolving interest in virtual assets reflects the broader global trend of cryptocurrency adoption among retail investors, who are attracted to the potential for quick profits and the increasing recognition of virtual assets as a legitimate investment class. "],"entity":[{"type":"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Education Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"eight percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"75 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"one percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$200 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"74 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"73 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"July 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"11 percent","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["Hong Kong"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
