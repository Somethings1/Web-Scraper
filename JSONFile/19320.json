It could allow the company to leverage its rapidly rising transaction volume. An estimate obtained by Forbes indicates the company processed between USD 200bn and USD 250bn in transactions in 2019, and expanded by a robust 50% last year.","Additionally, last March, Stripe said it raised some USD 600m in funding at a USD 95bn valuation to boost its expansion in Europe, and support the increasing demand for the company\u2019s services from major players.","Moreover, the company is reportedly considering going public next year.","Per Bloomberg, Stripe is one of the most anticipated listings in years and it would mark one of the biggest private companies to ever go public. Therefore, it could become another public giant that would offer investors indirect exposure to the crypto market.","At this stage, this 11-year-old giant also wants to enter the crypto industry, as they\u2019re looking for a Staff Engineer for their \u201Cbrand new [crypto] team.\u201D ","\u201CAs a Staff Engineer on the team, you will design and build the core components that we need to support crypto use cases, as well as take new experiences in development from 0 to 1. You will work across everything from web\/mobile UIs [user interfaces] to backend, payments and identity systems,\u201D the job offer says. ","At least four employees to be supervised by Guillaume Poncin who previously led the company\u2019s engineering for banking and financial products.","Stripe says that it is looking for experienced engineers in the crypto space, \u201Cwho are invigorated by the opportunity to have a major impact on how users interact with crypto.\u201D","John Collison, Co-founder of Stripe, commented that the company\u2019s team started to write code the year after the Bitcoin (BTC) whitepaper was released, and while they \u201Chave always kept an eye on things,\u201D the developments over the last few years, such as layer 2 rollups, new blockchains, stablecoins, and decentralized finance (DeFi), were \u201Cparticularly exciting\u201D \u2013 and pushed Stripe to boost its exposure to crypto.","The announcement was welcomed by Brian Armstrong, Co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Coinbase, who tweeted it was \u201Cexciting to see\u201D how \u201Cevery major fintech company is now doing something with crypto.\u201D","\u201CAnd most major social companies (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook). Gaming is next,\u201D Armstrong predicted.","This said, some Twitter users remained skeptical of Stripe\u2019s plans for crypto.","\u201CYou ended support for Bitcoin as you saw it to be \u201Cless useful for payments\u201D and more \u2018of an asset than an exchange\u2019. Picking this back up, how do you plan to build products centered around online monetary transactions without supporting the asset?\u201D asked user \u2018joshmay.eth\u2019, making a reference to Stripe\u2019s announcement from January 2018.","The full-time job offer does not specify the salary range of Stripe\u2019s new employees, but it does state that candidates must have a strong technical background that includes at least 10 years of experience in designing and engineering large-scale systems. The available positions are based in Seattle, San Francisco, or New York, with remote work allowed only in North America.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Tweet and Get Bitcoin \u2013 Twitter Enables BTC Tips Over Lightning Network\n\u2013 Why Jack Dorsey\u2019s Square Paid USD 29B for Afterpay \n\n\u2013 Users to Begin Testing Robinhood Crypto Wallets Next Month\n\u2013 PayPal UK Steps into Bitcoin & Crypto Waters Too \n\n\u2013 Bakkt Users Will be Able to Spend Bitcoin via Google Pay\n\u2013 Coinshares Invests In Swiss Bank As Customers Increasingly Turn To Crypto\n\n\u2013 BitMEX Boss: El Salvador-style Bitcoin Adoption on the Cards for 5 More Nations\n\u2013 Bitcoin Lightning Network Is Growing Faster Than You Think"],"entity":[{"type":"San Francisco","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Spend Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Guillaume Poncin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"John Collison","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Armstrong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Seattle","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"North America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Stripe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Forbes","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cryptoverse","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin & Crypto Waters Too \n\n\u2013 Bakkt Users Will","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Begin Testing Robinhood Crypto Wallets Next Month\n\u2013 PayPal UK Steps","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Bitcoin","DeFi","Payments"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
