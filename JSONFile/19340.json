We\u2019re not trying to even win on fees. We\u2019re trying to win on being the most trusted, easiest to use.\u201D","When challenged to explain why Coinbase has not sought to drive down its fees in search of greater profitability, Haas claimed that \u201Cour biggest focus right now is to keep up with the current demand.\u201D She also added that Coinbase is \u201Cbundling custody and storage services into our trading fee,\u201D adding that \u201Cfees are not the sole basis that customers select who they engage with.\u201D","She also claimed that Coinbase Pro app usership rose in the first quarter of the current financial year with higher trading volumes, a factor that affected fees, stating:","\u201CAs Pro users increase their volume, their weighted average fee rate came down. We did not see any material movement between the two products \u2013 between the consumer app and the Pro app \u2013 and so it really was just additional volume coming on the Pro app that drove lower fees in Q1.\u201D","In a letter to shareholders, the exchange claimed that the number of its retail monthly transacting users (MTUs) \u201Cgrew to 6.1 million in Q1 2021,\u201D a figure that was \u201Cmore than double\u201D its Q4 2020 figures. The number appears to have far outstripped guidance forecasts made last month, when the company predicted an annual 15% rise to the 7 million user mark.","The firm has now revised its annual predictions, claiming that it could hit an average FY2021 MTU figure of as high as 9 million in a scenario that \u201Cassumes an increase in crypto market capitalization and moderate-to-high crypto asset price volatility.\u201D Such factors, Coinbase said, would effectively ensure a steady continuation of Q1 growth.","But less favorable markets could see Coinbase climb much slower, and hit the 7 million mark as previously forecasted \u2013 while a \u201C2018\u201D-style crypto winter could see user numbers shrink back to 5.5 million.","The firm reported total sales worth USD 1.8bn, meeting its guidance figures from last month. However, per Bloomberg, the results were \u201Cslightly below\u201D the USD 1.81bn analysts it consulted had predicted.","Meanwhile, Coinbase\u2019s net income was USD 771m, outpacing the same analysts\u2019 predictions of USD 762.6m.","Coinbase (COIN)\u2019s first month on Nasdaq:","__\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Considering Working For Coinbase?
