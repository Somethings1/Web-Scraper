X\u2019s intent to integrate cryptocurrency solutions into its platform is well known.","According to NMLS data, X has successfully secured the Rhode Island Currency Transmission License, a required regulatory authorization for the storage, transfer, and trading of digital currencies. This license essentially validates all crypto activities that involve safekeeping funds within a wallet.","Backed by the recent approval, X\u2019s extensive user base of 400 million individuals should soon be able to transact using cryptocurrencies. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that regulatory standards vary from country to country, so users in crypto-unfriendly nations may be left out.","Also, the crypto landscape already hosts a plethora of brokers, wallets, and platforms, making X\u2019s offering less revolutionary in nature, although perhaps it does mark an evolutionary step forward.","","BREAKING üö®: Twitter (X) Obtains License Required for Cryptocurrency Payments. üî•\n\nThis is bullish üöÄ üöÄ pic.twitter.com\/VziIlNG5Em","\nX owner Elon Musk has flirted with the idea transforming the social media platform into an \u201Ceverything app.\u201D For X to genuinely align with an \u201Ceverything app\u201D concept, it must aim to offer an integrated platform that includes diverse activities like shopping, payments, games, video, messaging, and more. Crypto can and likely will play a part in all of these activities.","Examples include the ability to buy exclusive content from thought leaders, transfer funds among friends and family, in-game purchases, tipping video creators for great content, and much more.¬†","This facet can be perceived as a value-added service, enhancing the incentivization for content creators to receive more equitable compensation for their dedicated efforts.","Coupled with Grayscale\u2019s court victory ruling, crypto prices rose higher on Tuesday, with Dogecoin, Musk\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency, outperforming others.","Dogecoin was seen trading higher by around 6% on Tuesday afternoon. This marks an outperformance compared to other major coins, like Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano which were up 5.5%, 3.7%, and 4.2%, respectively.","However, Dogecoin\u2019s gains trail those of Bitcoin, which was up by more than 7% amid expectations that the cryptocurrency community is one step closer towards the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.","Investors are likely jumping to the conclusion that Doge will play an outsized role in Twitter\u2019s foray into cryptocurrency.","","üê∂) Elon has been endorsing #DOGE on X since 2019 and has been assisting #Dogecoin developers.\nüê∂) Elon changed the logo on X's homepage to a #Shiba image this year.\nüê∂) #Floki briefly was X's CEO.\n\nNow, X obtained a license for #crypto payments and trading.$DOGE $SHIB $FLOKI https:\/\/t.co\/4cXYpE0WPw pic.twitter.com\/9O5q2222ib","This is a reasonable conclusion to make, given Musk\u2019s own profile now includes the Doge trading symbol.
