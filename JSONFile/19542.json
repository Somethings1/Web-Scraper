However, huge weekly inflows have been seen around the market leader on the institutional front.","On Feb 1, Bitfinex analysts noted a massive 13,500 BTC leaving miner wallets to exchanges, setting another record as the highest negative outflow.","However, the next 24 hours saw an inflow of approximately 10,000 BTC, bringing the net outflow to 3,500 BTC and 10,200 BTC since the approval.","The inflows recorded afterward can be linked to miners rebalancing their positions ahead of key events.Â The analysts point toward operational liquidity, strategic adjustments, and the price surge of 2023 as reasons for the net outflows.","During the bear cycle, miners suffered huge losses, leading to outright selling mining equipment, pivoting to other fields, and leveraging reserves to stay afloat.","However institutional entry recorded in 2023 sparked a price action in favour of miners, wiping out losses as they looked towards expansion.","\u201CThis substantial transfer of BTC from miners to exchanges reflects the miners\u2019 response to market conditions and potentially their need to liquidate holdings for operational expenses of risk management.\u201DÂ ","The flow of miners\u2019 Bitcoin reserves to exchanges is an important metric as it shows the amount of BTC accumulated by miners over a certain period. It also shows the current market stance as outflows to exchanges usually represent an intention to sell.","The upcoming Bitcoin halving is a factor affecting the recent offloading of assets to exchanges with miners raising capital to expand their capacity and machinery.","The halving will see rewards slashed by 50% spurring Bitcoin miners to look for more effective rigs.","ðŸ¤¯ðŸ“‰ Bitcoin Hash Rate Plunges Ahead of Anticipated Halving Event \u2013 Here\u2019s the Latest","Here's a summary ðŸ‘‡","\u2014 Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 18, 2024","",""],"entity":[{"type":"June 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1.826 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Q4 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitfinex Alpha","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February 5, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"miner BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January 18, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitfinex Alpha Market","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Exchanges","Miner"],"authors":["David Pokima"]}
