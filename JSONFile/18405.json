They may even receive additional cash on top of that amount.","This unexpected windfall is possible because FTX said it recovered billions more dollars than initially anticipated to cover customer losses from its Nov. 2022 collapse.","FTX revealed it amassed roughly $15b, primarily from selling venture capital investments made by the exchange and its affiliate Alameda Research. This amount is enough to fully repay nearly all creditors with claims of $50,000 or less (representing 98% of creditors). The remaining creditors will also receive a significant recovery, with a minimum payout of 118% of their claims.","The defunct exchange\u2019s proposed reorganization plan goes beyond simply repaying creditors.","The FTX Debtors today filed their anticipated amended Plan of Reorganization and accompanying Disclosure Statement with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

This means customers won\u2019t just get their money back, they may also receive interest on it.","This payout to over 2m customers is a rare occurrence in typical US bankruptcy cases, where creditors often receive only a fraction of what they\u2019re owed.","Some creditors, depending on their claim type, could see a return of up to 142% \u2013 meaning they get back more than they originally lost.","FTX\u2019s payout plan is significantly better than initial expectations. Back in October, the company anticipated returning just 90% of customer funds. This outlook improved in January when CEO John Ray III told the court he expected full repayment for customers.","FTX is expected to have a significant surplus of cash ($16.3b) after selling all its assets, according to the filing. This is more than enough to cover what it owes to customers and other non-government lenders (about $11.2b).","\u201CThe debtors and their stakeholders have had time to explore strategic options and runway to monetize illiquid and volatile investments gradually over time,\u201D the filing said.","FTX had been aggressively selling off its assets to raise the funds needed to repay creditors.","This includes investments both FTX and its affiliate made, such as an 8% stake in AI startup Anthropic. That stake was sold to institutional investors for a total of $884m back in March.","The proposed distribution plan remains contingent upon formal approval from the Delaware bankruptcy court. Even if approved, a disbursement of funds to creditors and account holders is likely a few months away, as FTX navigates the concluding stages of its bankruptcy proceedings."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S. Bankruptcy Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Delaware","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$884m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"98%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"118%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nov. 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$50,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$15b","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"142%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"John Ray III","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$16.3","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 7, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$11.2","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["FTX","FTX Bankruptcy","FTX Creditors"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
