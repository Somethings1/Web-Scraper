Also, private-sector crypto platforms will execute trades on the exchange. ","Yet, in late May, Bali Governor Wayan Koster suggested that the popular Indonesian tourist island will tighten rules around payments to make it harder for foreign tourists to pay with crypto.","Just recently, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, a vice presidential candidate in the upcoming Indonesian election, said he aims to accelerate Indonesia\u2019s position as a leader in the digital revolution by cultivating expertise in blockchain and cryptocurrencies.","\u201CWe are preparing blockchain experts, we are preparing cybersecurity experts, we are preparing crypto experts,\u201D Gibran affirmed during the event on December 10."],"entity":[{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u2019s Financial Services Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 17, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bappebti","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"December 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Indonesia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Didid Noordiatmoko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gibran","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bali","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CFX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commodity Future Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2014 fall","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gibran Rakabuming Raka","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wayan Koster","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulation","Indonesia"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
