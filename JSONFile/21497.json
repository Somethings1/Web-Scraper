The extra tokens were then traded for ether.","In an on-chain message late on Sunday, the attacker offered Normie developers a way to receive 90% of the stolen funds back if they agreed to relaunch the project.","\u201CI offer to return 90% of the exploited ETH, keeping 10% as a bug bounty (with no reprisals,\u201D the on-chain message reads. \u201COne condition: it, and the 600 ETH in the dev wallet, are used to fairly launch a new token that is used to reimburse NORMIE holders.\u201D","Six hundred ether is worth nearly $2.3 million at current prices. The move marked one of the first instances of an attacker keeping a project relaunch as a condition to return funds. Normie developers accepted the bounty offer as of early Monday, messages on the project's official Telegram group viewed by CoinDesk showed.","In another on-chain message in Asian morning hours on Monday, the attacker called Normie\u2019s contract code a \u201Ccopy-paste\u201D job which was likely not thoroughly reviewed by its developers prior to being pushed live.","\u201CThis exact code is present in a number of other token contracts, a few of which significantly pre-date Normie. Most meme tokens are simply copy-paste jobs from the same small set of contracts, all with over-complicated tax logic in the transfer function,\u201D the attacker said.","\u201CI suspect this simply a case of them re-using code they didn't thoroughly review,\u201D they added. Before the dump, NORMIE was among the top meme coins on Base with a market capitalization of over $40 million and nearly 90,000 on-chain token holders, as per DEXTools metrics. Normie is slang for a \u201Cnormal person,\u201D and the Base version was modeled after a blue coloured frog that resembled the popular Pepe the Frog character.","It sits at a market capitalization of just $700 as of early Monday following the exploit.","Meanwhile, at least one NORMIE investor faced a massive loss due to the attack, with their $1.6 million in investment turning to just $150 in seconds.","\u201CSince $NORMIE was exploited, the 11.23M $NORMIE that this trader spent $1.16M to buy is now worth less than $150,\u201D analysis firm Lookonchain posted on X. \u201CHe spent $1.16M to buy 11.23M $NORMIE at $0.1035 from Mar 25 to Apr 9 and has held it until now without selling it.\u201D","Normie\u2019s X has been suspended as of early Asian hours on Monday."],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$700","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$NORMIE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Normie","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$40 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"99%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.1035","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.16","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Normie\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mar 25 to Apr 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$150","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Base","meme coin"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
