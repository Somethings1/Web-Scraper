In its simplest form, crypto arbitrage trading is the process of buying a digital asset on one exchange and selling it (just about) simultaneously on another where the price is higher.","This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.","Sign up for CoinDesk\u2019s Learn Crypto Investing Course.","Doing so means making profits through a process that involves little or no risks. The other great thing about this strategy is you don\u2019t have to be a professional investor with an expensive set-up in order to begin arbitrage trading.","Arbitrage has been a mainstay of traditional financial markets long before the emergence of the crypto market. And yet, there seems to be more hype surrounding the potential of arbitrage opportunities in the crypto scene.","This is most likely because the crypto market is renowned for being highly volatile compared to other financial markets. This means crypto asset prices tend to deviate significantly over a certain time period. Because crypto assets are traded globally across hundreds of exchanges 24\/7, there are far more opportunities for arbitrage traders to find profitable price discrepancies.","All a trader would need to do is spot a difference in the pricing of a digital asset across two or more exchanges and execute a series of transactions to take advantage of the difference.","For example, let\u2019s assume the price of bitcoin is $45,000 on the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange and $45,200 on Kraken. In this scenario, crypto arbitrageurs might spot this disparity and buy bitcoin on Coinbase and sell it on Kraken to pocket the $200 price difference. This is a typical example of a crypto arbitrage trade.","Read more: 4 Tips to Maximize Your Crypto Investment","The first thing you need to be know is the pricing of assets on centralized exchanges depends on the most recent bid-ask matched order on the exchange order book. In other words, the most recent price at which a trader buys or sells a digital asset on an exchange is considered the real-time price of that asset on the exchange.","For instance, if the order to buy bitcoin for $60,000 is the most recently matched order on an exchange, this price becomes the latest price of bitcoin on the platform. The next matched order after this will also determine the next price of the digital asset. Therefore, price discovery on exchanges is a continuous process of stipulating the market price of a digital asset based on its most recent selling price.","Note that the price also tends to vary because investor demand for an asset is slightly different on each exchange.","Decentralized crypto exchanges, however, use a different method for pricing crypto assets. Known as an \u201Cautomated market maker\u201D system, this directly relies on crypto arbitrage traders to keep prices in line with those shown across other exchanges.","Here, instead of an order book system where buyers and sellers are matched together to trade crypto assets at a certain price and amount, decentralized exchanges rely on liquidity pools. For every crypto trading pair, a separate pool must be created. For example, if someone wished to trade ether (ETH) for link (LINK) they would need to locate an ETH\/LINK liquidity pool on the exchange.","Each pool is funded by voluntary contributors who deposit their own crypto assets to provide liquidity that others trade against in exchange for a proportionate share of the pool\u2019s transaction fees. The main benefit of this system is that traders don\u2019t have to wait for a counterparty (an opposite trader) to buy or sell assets at a certain price. Trading can be executed at any time.","Across most popular decentralized exchanges, the prices of both assets in the pool (A and B) are maintained by a mathematical formula. This formula keeps the ratio of assets in the pool balanced.","What this means is, when a trader wishes to buy ether from the ETH\/LINK pool, he would have to add LINK tokens to the pool in order to remove ETH tokens from it. When this happens, it causes the ratio of assets to change (more LINK tokens in the pool and less ETH.) In order to restore balance, the protocol automatically lowers the price of LINK and increases the price of ETH. This encourages traders to remove the cheaper LINK and add ETH until the prices realign with the rest of the market.","In circumstances where a trader changes the ratio significantly in a pool (executes a large trade), it can create big differences in the prices of the assets in the pool compared to their market value (the average price reflected across all other exchanges).","Read more: What Is an Automated Market Maker?","There are several ways crypto arbitrageurs can profit off of market inefficiencies. Some of them are:","A trader could exchange bitcoin for ether, then trade the ether for Cardano\u2019s ADA token and, lastly, convert the ADA back to bitcoin. In this example, the trader moved their fund between three crypto trading pairs \u2013 BTC\/ETH → ETH\/ADA → ADA\/BTC. If there are discrepancies in any of the prices of the three crypto trading pairs, the trader will end up with more bitcoin than they had at the beginning of the trade. Here, all the transactions are executed on one exchange. Therefore, the trader does not need to withdraw or deposit funds across multiple exchanges.","You might have noticed that, unlike day traders, crypto arbitrage traders do not have to predict the future prices of bitcoin nor enter trades that could take hours or days before they start generating profits.","By spotting arbitrage opportunities and capitalizing on them, traders base their decision on the expectation of generating fixed profit without necessarily analyzing market sentiments or relying on other predictive pricing strategies. Also, depending on the resources available to traders, it is possible to enter and exit an arbitrage trade in seconds or minutes. Bearing these in mind, we can therefore conclude the following:","However, this does not necessarily mean that crypto arbitrageurs are completely free from risks.","Read more: Mastering Emotions and Managing Risk in Cryptocurrency Trading","Certain factors could diminish an arbitrageur\u2019s chances of generating profit. The low-risk nature of arbitrage opportunities has an impact on their profitability; less risk tends to yield low profits. This is why crypto arbitrageurs must execute high volumes of trades to generate substantial gains. What\u2019s more, arbitrage trades aren\u2019t exactly free.","Remember that arbitrage trading across two exchanges may incur withdrawal, deposit and trading fees. These fees may accumulate and eat into your profits. Using our original example as a case study, let us assume that the withdrawal fees of Coinbase, deposit fees of Kraken and the trading fees of Kraken add up to an extra 2%. The total cost of executing this trade is $45,000 + (2% * $45,000) = $45,900. In other words, the crypto arbitrage trader must have incurred a loss since the potential profit is only $200.","To mitigate the risks of incurring losses due to exorbitant fees, arbitrageurs could choose to limit their activities to exchanges with competitive fees. They could also deposit funds on multiple exchanges and reshuffle their portfolios to take advantage of market inefficiencies.","For example, Bob spots the price disparities between bitcoin on Coinbase and Kraken and decides to go all in. However, instead of moving funds between the two exchanges, Bob already has funds denominated in tether (USDT) on Coinbase and 1 BTC on Kraken. So, all he has to do is sell his 1 BTC on Kraken for $45,200 and buy 1 BTC on Coinbase with $45,000 USDT. At the end of this trade, he still generates the $200 profit and avoids paying withdrawal and deposit fees. Here, the only fee that Bob has to worry about is the trading fee. It is worth mentioning that trading fees are relatively low for traders executing high volumes of trades.","Crypto arbitrage trading is time sensitive. As more traders capitalize on a particular arbitrage opportunity, the price disparity between the two exchanges tends to disappear.","Let us consider the difference in the profitability of Bob and Sarah due to the timing of their trades. In this scenario, Bob is the first to spot and capitalize on the arbitrage opportunity from our original example. This was followed by an attempt by Sarah to do the same.","Below are some of the factors that could adversely affect the time it takes to execute crypto arbitrage trades:","Since arbitrage traders have to deposit lots of funds on exchange wallets, they are susceptible to security risks associated with exchange hacks and exit scams. Exit scams occur when a company suddenly halts its operations and carts away with users\u2019 funds. In light of this, it is advisable to carry out due diligence and stick to reputable crypto exchanges.","Whether you\u2019re a beginner trader or a veteran investor, the great thing about crypto arbitrage trading is there are a number of platforms available today which automate the process of finding and trading price discrepancies across multiple exchanges. These \u201Cset it and forget it\u201D platforms can offer a great passive income opportunity for traders who are looking for a low-risk, hands-off trading solution, and include:","This guide to the RSI indicator will help you in making timely trades and hopefully walk away with a win.","While bitcoin\u2019s wild price movements might seem random, they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets.","The crypto industry is booming.
