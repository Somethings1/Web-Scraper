The category includes entities that would have fit into other categories prior to being sanctioned, with the Russian darknet market Hydra pointed to as one example.","The Hydra marketplace, which was sanctioned in April 2022, accounted for 50% of all funds sent to mixers from sanctioned entities this year, the report said. ","It added that the remaining 50% largely came from the two North Korean hacker groups, Lazarus Group and Blender.io. ","In April this year, the US FBI claimed that the Lazarus Group was behind Axie Infinity\u2018s Ronin Bridge hack. Furthermore, in late June, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said it had traced funds sent through crypto mixer Tornado Cash, stolen in Harmony\u2019s Horizon Bridge hack, and that their analysis indicates that the hack and subsequent asset laundering are consistent with activities of the Lazarus Group.","The \u201Csanctioned entities\u201D category in the Chainalysis\u2019 report was followed by \u201Cstolen funds\u201D as the second-biggest illicit user of mixer services during the quarter.","Notably, Chainalysis also argued that mixers could soon become obsolete as the firm \u201Ccontinues to refine the ability to demix certain mixing transactions and see users\u2019 original source of funds.\u201D","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 BTC Mixer Flags Illegal Moves\n\u2013 Sanctioned Bitcoin Mixer\n\n\u2013 UK Crime Agency Calls For Crypto Mixing Regulation Amid Clampdown On Criminals\n\u2013 As New Crypto Sanction Screening Tool Launched, Tornado Cash Keeps Mixing and FBI Chimes In\n\n\u2013 Crypto Anonymity Must End, States Top Russian Policymaker\n\u2013 DeFi Industry Must Tackle Lack Of Transparency, Pseudonymity: SEC Commissioner"],"entity":[{"type":"Elliptic","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"second quarter of this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"DeFi Industry Must Tackle Lack Of Transparency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC Mixer Flags Illegal Moves\n\u2013 Sanctioned Bitcoin Mixer\n\n\u2013 UK Crime Agency Calls For Crypto Mixing Regulation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lazarus Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"23%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"0.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022 marks","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Chainalysis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"crypto mixers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Infinity\u2018s Ronin Bridge","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Anonymity Must End","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Anonymity","Chainalysis","Crime","DeFi","Exchange","Scam"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
