Dogeverse plans to fit the bill by being all things to all chains. It is already live on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain and Polygon but has Solana, Base and Avalanche in the works for launch day. This multi-bridge utility is a massive extension to the power of the Doge universe.","Dogeverse is doing something no other meme coin has attempted. There are multi-chains already but none are as expansive and interconnected as Dogeverse plans to be.¬†","The new crypto presale Dogeverse is inserting itself into a narrative that is concentrating minds on the widening opportunities of meme coins being spun up on multiple chains.","Let\u2019s make no bones about it, Dogeverse is the first meme coin to launch on the six most used blockchains after Bitcoin. Now that is something to boast about.","Dogeverse is the first chain-traveling Doge and is priced at $0.00029, with a final presale price of $0.00030500. The second price stage ($0.00029100) starts in three days\u2019 time or when $870,000 has been raised. It means there is no time to lose to avail of the lowest price as the first target could be hit in the next few hours.","Keep in touch with developments on the project\u2019s X\/Twitter and Telegram.","üê∂#Cosmo is on a mission to unite the #Crypto universe. üí´","His journeys across #ETH and #SOL made $DOGE a symbol of unity and creativity, birthing the #DOGEVERSE! üåå","Now, he shares his chain-traveling power, enabling $DOGEVERSE holders to explore top #Crypto chains freely. üöÄüîó pic.twitter.com\/wNKR3Ir0s7","\u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 8, 2024","","If multi-chain is not impressive enough, then there\u2019s the self-propulsion already baked into the Doge ecosystem that comes from the musings and persona of Elon Musk. The multibillionaire has a lot on his plate, but he still makes time to sing the praises of Dogecoin.","Bring all these market-friendly attributes together in one multi-coin and this project starts to feel like it could be a meme coin monster.","The chains targeted by $DOGVERSE are a mixture of Layer 1s like Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana and BNB Smart Chain, alongside Layer 2s such as Polygon and Base. It would be fair to say that Dogeverse has got every angle covered.","In crypto there is no time to rest on your laurels, as the expansion in the number of chains being used to launch meme coins attests. The rate of change is quickening which is why Dogeverse is looking very much like it is the smartest doggie of them all by going all in on multi-chain.¬†¬†","Once derided as a nice idea but too ambitious, Solana is showing its worth and has for all intents and purposes overthrown Ethereum when it comes to the future of meme coins.","Meet #Cosmo! üëã","The world\u2019s first chain traveling #Doge! üêïüåå","You can now get $DOGEVERSE on any of the chains:#Ethereum üåê#BNBSmartChain üîó#Polygon üì¶","Coming soon too\u2026#Solana ‚òÄÔ∏è#Avalanche C-Chain ‚ùÑÔ∏è#Base üöÄ pic.twitter.com\/hVOd5dww1D","\u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 8, 2024","","Yet its advantages over Ethereum don\u2019t mean that Solana isn\u2019t in its turn vulnerable to a competing chain coming along to muscle in on its newly acquired dominance.¬†","Base and Polygon both address Ethereum\u2019s weaknesses in slightly different ways with Layer 2 solutions running atop the primary transactional settlement layer.","Tokens such as $DEGEN have leveraged this on Base by building on top of it a Layer 3. DEGEN has a fully diluted market capitalization of $1.56 billion. Meanwhile, another Base coin, $BRETT, has exploded in value, currently trading at $0.0792, near its all-time high.","$BRETT is about to be ONE OF THE ONLY memecoins in history to reach a billion dollar market cap","and the first to ever do it on Base","EVERY SINGLE MEME that ever hit 1B","ran to 3B+","history is being made.","congrats to @jessepollak and all early base adopters","this is a huge win\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/Ky2jaJaZ5P","\u2014 Crash (@CrashiusClay69) April 8, 2024","","Similar to the phenomenon witnessed on Solana, meme coins are bringing tens of thousands of new users to the Base chain. Dogeverse will be adding to this momentum in its own unique way by effectively enabling tunnels to be created that effortlessly bridge access and liquidity across chains, making meme-coin investing even more flexible, not to mention valuable.","Named \u2018Cosmo the Doge\u2019, this cute little mut was \u201Cborn with the unique ability to hyperjump between the stars of the crypto universe\u201D \u2013 and there\u2019s no doubt with that sort of utility, he could even become a superstar himself.","Total token supply is 200 billion, with 15% allocated to the presale and 10% to staking rewards. Buyers in the presale can start staking straightaway.","The Dogeverse has just got a whole lot bigger with Cosmo the Doge bounding onto the meme coin playing field. Dogeverse makes single-chain meme coins stale \u2013 get with the multi-chain program and the hyper ROI.¬†","Buy Dogeverse Here",""],"entity":[{"type":"$0.00029","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.00030500","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Base","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BNB Smart Chain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cosmo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dogeverse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$DOGE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Twitter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$0.00029100","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$DOGVERSE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$DOGEVERSE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.56 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$0.0792","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$BRETT","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monday, April 8th, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$870,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$254,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$DEGEN","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Dogecoin","Dogeverse","Elon Musk"],"authors":["Gary McFarlane"]}
