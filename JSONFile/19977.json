Globally, just over a third of respondents said they were \u201Csomewhat or very likely to try paying with crypto\u201D in the next year, with fewer than 6 in 10 stating that they \u201Cwould feel more confident about crypto if they knew it was issued or backed by a reputable organization.\u201D","Mastercard\u2019s survey also found that digital payments are on the rise in Latin America, with 95% of respondents stating that they intended to use digital payment methods in the next year. Almost a third of respondents stated that they had used less cash over the past 12 months.","The survey\u2019s findings come hot on the heels of a flurry of activity in the region from Mastercard\u2019s rival Visa. The latter rolled out a number of crypto cards in Brazil and Argentina this month \u2013 in partnership with major local blockchain industry players.","Walter Pimenta, Mastercard\u2019s Executive Vice President of Products and Engineering in the Latin America\/Caribbean region, was quoted as stating that \u201Cmore and more Latin Americans are showing interest in cryptocurrencies and want solutions that facilitate access to the crypto world.\u201D","He added that Mastercard was now working on \u201Csolutions to expand digital inclusion and strengthening alliances that guarantee operability and support.\u201D","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Mastercard to Enable Direct NFT Payment Options for Marketplace Operators\n\u2013 Mastercard Doubles Down on its Crypto Strategy With New Acquisition\n\n\u2013 Visa Rolls out Multiple \u2018Bitcoin Cashback\u2019 Cards with Partners in Brazil, Argentina\n\u2013 Brazil\u2019s Judges Receive Crypto \u2018Training,\u2019 Minister Warns of \u2018Gaps\u2019 in Regulation\n\n\u2013 One in Seven Wealthy People Now Owns \u2018Digital Assets\u2019 \u2013 Survey\n\u2013 40% of Surveyed Lower-income Individuals Want to Use Bitcoin \u2013 Not to Make Money"],"entity":[{"type":"Mastercard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Latin America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"54%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Brazil","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"67%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"LAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"66%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"77%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"82%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"51%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"95%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Walter Pimenta","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Argentina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Enable Direct NFT Payment Options for Marketplace Operators\n\u2013 Mastercard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Caribbean","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"69%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Crypto Strategy With New Acquisition","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Latin America","mastercard","Payments","Stablecoin","Survey"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
