However, in February 2022, crypto was all over the game. At least six companies ran ads during the final, including Bitbuy, Coinbase, Crypto.com, eToro, FTX, and Budweiser. While Bud\u2019s advert was about beer, it also prominently included imagery from the Nouns NFT project, which the brewery had entered a partnership with after purchasing a Nouns NFT last January.","üçª ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®","\u2014 Bud Light (@budlight) January 19, 2022","","Crypto\u2019s 2022 Super Bowl moment was a roll call of A-listers, with Matt Damon, Larry David, Kevin Durant and Lebron James all featuring in crypto promotions.","For many, it was their first sighting of Damon\u2019s \u201CFortune Favors The Brave\u201D commercial for the Crypto.com exchange. The media and Twitter both widely panned the commercial, with pundits calling it \u201Ccringeworthy,\u201D \u201Can embarrassing cash grab\u201D and an advertisement for a Ponzi scheme.","Damon doubled down on his choice to do the advert, saying that his charity water.org was having a \u201Cdown year.\u201D Damon not only donated his wages from the commercial to the charity, but he also revealed that Crypto.com donated an additional $1 million unbidden.","Curb Your Enthusiasm star Larry David had more regret over his FTX commercial, though. After the exchange\u2019s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty for fraud, David and other celebrities who promoted the platform faced a class action lawsuit over their involvement promoting the company. David later called himself an \u201Cidiot\u201D for agreeing to do the commercial.¬†","While Coinbase didn\u2019t opt for a cinematic ad, the US-registered exchange did spend $16,000,000 to float a QR code on people\u2019s television screens for 60 seconds. The website crashed a few seconds after it aired, prompting many amused takes on Twitter.","Coinbase spending $16,000,000 on a Superbowl ad to direct people to their website and $0 to make sure that website doesn't crash 10 seconds after the ad starts is so very internet.","\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 14, 2022","","¬†"],"entity":[{"type":"Nouns NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$0","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 19, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kevin Durant","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FOX Business","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gupta","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Edward Snowden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mayur Gupta","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"David","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Larry David","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Matt Damon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US National Football League","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$16,000,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February 14, 2022","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Kraken","Marketing","super bowl"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
