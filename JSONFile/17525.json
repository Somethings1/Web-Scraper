In fact, among those rallying by double-digit percentage figures, PEPE is a little behind.","DogWifHat (WIF) grew 20% over the last 24 hours to change hands at $3.37, Floki (FLOKI) added 16% to trade at $0.0001998, while BONK mushroomed a staggering 33% to hit $0.00002701 as of this writing.¬†","Still, meme coins are faring much better than the market leaders today.","The original and biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) remains unchanged from yesterday at around $66,395. Its closest contender Ethereum (ETH), the most commercially important blockchain, added a slight 2% to trade at $3,245.¬†","PEPE\u2019s trading chart outlines the rollercoaster ride that many meme coins have been on over the last three months. The end of February began a rally that saw PEPE reaching a new high watermark of $0.00001064 on March 14. Today\u2019s price represents a 26% pullback from that.¬†","PEPE is currently in recovery mode.","Its value is going up, but its Relative Strength Index is 65 and falling, indicating that the latest spate of buying (prompted by the Coinbase announcement) is cooling off. Still, PEPE is not likely to lose much from this downturn in the short-term.","The token is currently hovering at a strong psychological support threshold, but should further losses occur, it could find safety at $0.000007.¬†","Pepe is a massively successful meme coin because, like its rivals Dogecoin, Bonk and DogWifHat, the underlying meme that inspired it has oodles of cultural capital.","However, dog coins and Pepe are beginning to feel like meme coins from a different era. Crypto has changed very rapidly over the last few months, thanks largely to pivotal market narratives such as the launch of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and Bitcoin\u2019s fourth quadrennial halving update last weekend.","In short, the jokes around Pepe and the dog coins run the risk of getting stale.","Enter Solana\u2019s latest meme coin sensation Slothana ($SLOTH). From the clock on the wall indicating 4:20 to his baked red-eyes and contented smirk, Slothana is clearly cut from a different cloth.¬†","Slothana has raised¬†over $15 million¬†in his ICO as traders flocked to the coin hoping to catch some of the early price booms of other Solana meme legends that have pumped recently, like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk.","üöÄüåï Prepare for a moonshot as we ready the engines of the Slothship! üåøü¶• With the launch just around the corner, our slothful crew is gearing up for an epic journey through the crypto cosmos.
