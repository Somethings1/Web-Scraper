It went down to 25 from 50 bitcoin per block in November 2012 and further decreased to 12.5 units in July 2016.","","","Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained","","","The immediate implication after halving is that the newly minted bitcoin in a day will fall from 1,800 to 900 units. That would also mean mining operators will see their daily total revenue \u2013Â at bitcoin's current price of $8600 \u2013 reduced from $15 million to $8 million.","","","As such, it has been expected the computing power connected to the Bitcoin network will fall significantly after the halving as the revenue decrease will squeeze out those miner operators who lack efficient resources to cut their electricity costs.","","","However, it remains to be seen how that will play out after the halving. Currently, the average Bitcoin total computing power over the last seven days since the previous mining difficulty adjustment has hit a new all-time high of 121 exahashes per second (EH\/s), beating the previous record of 118 EH\/s, according to data from Chinese mining pool PoolIn.","","","As such, Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty \u2013 a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards \u2013 is expected to increase by 4.9% in about seven days to an all-time high above 16.55 trillion, based on PoolIn's data estimate.","","","Bitcoin's mining difficulty is programmed to adjust every 2,016 blocks \u2013 about every two weeks \u2013 based on the amount of computing power participating in mining activity during the period.",""],"entity":[{"type":"$2.3","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"4.9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"November 2012","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2009","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"July 2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$8600","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Halving"],"authors":["Wolfie Zhao"]}
