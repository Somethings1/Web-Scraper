[PayPal]","Over the years, PayPal has been exploring ways to integrate NFTs into its platform, allowing users to buy, sell, and hold NFTs directly through their PayPal accounts. This move signified PayPal\u2019s recognition of the growing interest in NFTs and its willingness to cater to this emerging market.","On Monday, NFT sales volume was down 24% over the last 24 hours, standing at $35,628,790. While the number of sellers is down 1%, buyers and transactions are up 3% and 9%, respectively, according to CryptoSlam. Half of the top 10 collections by sales were up. Among these green coins, Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s sales increased the most.","In 2021, buyers were willing to part with millions on digital collectables for NFTs offered by artists and luxury brands. It seems the chatter and hype around NFTs has faded into the background.","In January, GameStop revealed it had shut down its NFT marketplace, signalling its withdrawal from the cryptocurrency space. The announcement was made via a statement on the platform with the firm stating \u201Cthe continuing regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space\u201D as the primary reason behind this decision.","Trading of NFTs has been in decline for over a year. Data compiled by Statista shows the number of active wallets involved in NFT trading has declined.","The NFT bear market continues which can be linked to the crypto market which has been stagnant. Is it game ove for NFTs? Or will the digital collectible make a comeback?","In 2023 PayPal launched its native dollar-pegged Stablecoin \u201CPYUSD\u201D which is backed by cash and short-term treasuries. Recently the Silicon Valley-based company announced the new featureÂ powered by its money transfer platform Xoom.
