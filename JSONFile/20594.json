Along with Manchester United, they are arguably the biggest name team in the English Premier League (EPL), and for the crypto sector, landing a deal of this scale would be a major coup.","Ornstein wrote:","\u201CThe club are also talking to firms from sectors including electronics, media, and tourism. Among those parties [\u2026] are companies from the cryptocurrency sector. They include a crypto exchange firm and a blockchain platform.\u201D","The journalist added:","\u201CIt is likely to be controversial but Liverpool are desperate to financially compete with other elite clubs and maximize their commercial deals.\u201D","The Liverpool Echo, which also has close ties to the club, reported that the club is set to \u201Ctest the water with regards to the strength of the sponsorship market before entering into serious discussions\u201D with potential sponsors.","The same media outlet reported that the current sponsorship deal that Liverpool has with the TradFi (traditional finance) banking giant Standard Chartered expires at the end of next season. The bank has sponsored the Reds since 2010 and is worth some USD 51 million per year.","The Liverpool Echo claimed that it \u201Cunderstands that the finance firm have interest in remaining a partner of the club.\u201D","Other media outlets have also claimed that Standard Chartered wants to continue its sponsorship deal, but it is highly likely that the Reds \u2013 who have enjoyed phenomenal success under current manager Jurgen Klopp \u2013 will want considerably more than they are currently receiving from a potential partner. The club will play in the semi-finals of the Champions League later this week, has already won the EPL League Cup, and in May will play in the final of the FA Cup.","Ornstein noted:","\u201CTalks are continuing with all parties, with Liverpool hopeful of finalizing a deal, which is expected to bring in more than USD 89 million over two seasons, in the next eight weeks.\u201D","However, the journalist noted that \u201Cthe possibility of Liverpool partnering with a crypto sponsor has not yet been discussed with supporters.\u201D","A recent non-fungible token (NFT) project drew the ire of some sections of the club\u2019s fanbase, and the Echo stated that the club was \u201Cunderstood to be against any sponsorship deals with fan token firms in their current guise, taking the likes of Socios off the table.\u201D It added that \u201Csignificant sponsorship offers from fan token firms have already been rejected this year by the club.\u201D","Jason Wilde, a 38-year-old Liverpool fan, told Cryptonews.com:","\u201CI do think this news is being put out there to test fan opinion, as some have suggested. I think if the deal wasn\u2019t with an unscrupulous company and it allowed the club to invest in the playing squad, fans wouldn\u2019t necessarily be too upset in the long run.\u201D","On the r\/LiverpoolFC subreddit, fans questioned the mathematics used to calculate the deal, claiming that USD 89m over two seasons was actually lower than the worth of Standard Chartered\u2019s current deal.","Others expressed reservations, with one Redditor writing:","\u201CLFC deserves a high-paying sponsor, but I\u2019m not feeling this.\u201D","Another opined:","\u201CIt really depends who [the firms are]. Crypto isn\u2019t a blanket of \u2018all is bad.\u2019\u201D","Others questioned the motivation behind those expressing their disapproval, claiming that a number of firms working in the TradFi world had been complicit in money laundering, and one opined:","\u201CI can\u2019t believe that you genuinely believe crypto is worse than an investment bank.\u201D","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Messi Inks USD 20M Deal in Another Crypto Marketing Effort\n\u2013 The Rise of Football Fan Tokens: What Are They & Do We Really Need Them?\n\n\u2013 FC Barcelona\u2019s Crypto Plan\n\u2013 FC Barcelona \u2018Rejected\u2019 USD 79.4M Sponsorship Deal from Crypto Firm over \u2018Ethical\u2019 Worries\n\n\u2013 Binance CEO Eyed Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea\n\u2013 Crypto.com Scores World Cup"],"entity":[{"type":"LFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"later this week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Liverpool Echo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Messi Inks USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2010","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Liverpool","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Champions League","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jurgen Klopp","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Ornstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jason Wilde","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Manchester United","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Liverpool","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Cups\/Champions League","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ornstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USD 51 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"EPL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Barcelona","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"USD 89 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Standard Chartered","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FA","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Blockchain","Exchange","Marketing","Sport","UK"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
