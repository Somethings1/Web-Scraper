This fix will also prevent the same issue from happening again,\u201D Binance said.","The exchange repeated that during the entire time that Bitcoin withdrawals were paused on the Bitcoin network, users were able to withdraw BTC using other chains, including ERC-20 and BEP-20.","Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also shared the hash of one specific transaction \u201Cthat got things stuck.\u201D He then mentioned another transaction that was still stuck.","Notably, the SBI Crypto mining pool \u201Cmanually prioritized and mined [the transaction] in block 740683,\u201D according to Carson Smith, CEO of the company.","@cz_binance Your transaction is unstuck now.\n\nThe team at @SBICrypto pool decided to help @binance We manually prioritized and mined in block 740683.\n\nBlockhttps:\/\/t.co\/9ctAAxfAUN\nTxhttps:\/\/t.co\/TACog0DzAF https:\/\/t.co\/ha1Ezek6N4","While all evidence seems to support Binance\u2019s explanation, some users still argue the exchange may be using fractional reserve systems, allowing customers to trade in \u201Cnaked\u201D Bitcoin that exists only on their internal books.","\u201CSo real btc is halted from leaving a centralized exchange so that the exchange\u2019s \u201Cpaper\u201D btc can still move right along?\u201D one Twitter user said.","Exchanges are using much more BTC than they actually own","Major crypto lender Celsius (CEL) also suspended withdrawals, Swaps, and transfers between accounts early Monday. This, along with Binance\u2019s suspension of withdrawals, while unrelated, seems to have further exacerbated the general panic in the crypto market.","Bitcoin resumed its downward movement, falling to as low as USD 21,046 in the past day, according to CoinGecko. At 8:23, it\u2019s trading at USD 22,759, down by 7.8% over the past 24 hours and 27.4% over the week.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Binance Pauses Bitcoin Withdrawals Due to \u2018Backlog\u2019\n\u2013 Binance Wins Day in Court, US Judge Dismisses Lawsuit\n\n\u2013 BNB Stretches Losses as Binance Fights New Regulatory and Media Battles\n\u2013 BNB Chain Launches New Roadmap as Competition With Ethereum Heats Up\n\n\u2013 Binance Claims It\u2019s Probably The Only Crypto Exchange That Has A Responsible Trading Program\n\u2013 After Binance Secures French License, New Hires Underway, Hopes for New Permits "],"entity":[{"type":"7.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Binance Pauses Bitcoin Withdrawals Due to \u2018Backlog\u2019\n\u2013 Binance Wins Day in Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SBI Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"8:23","content":"TIME"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Carson Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New Hires Underway","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"27.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Bitcoin","Exchange","Trading"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
