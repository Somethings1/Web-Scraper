Transaction impossible without the update. Downloaded electrum 4.0.0. exe which has no signature and is marked as malware by Avast. As a result, approved transactions are redirected to the above address and the amount is corrected to all wallet content (minus transaction fee). Please boycott that address.\u201D","The wallet holder in question has received over BTC 1,509 \u2013 but has apparently taken care to keep the crypto moving, sending almost the same amount off to other addresses.","ZDNet claimed it had identified tracked \u201Cmultiple Bitcoin accounts where criminals have gathered stolen funds from attacks they carried out over the course of 2019 and 2020,\u201D adding that the latest attacks had taken \u201Cas recently as September 2020.\u201D","The users claim they were presented with an apparent pop-up window asking them to download a software update for the wallet in order to complete transactions. This is part of a phishing attack that eventually prompts users to send their funds to what appears to be a series of scammers\u2019 wallets.","The same user who claims they lost BTC 1,400 in the bogus update scam expanded on the matter on a Github thread, with one developer writing,","\u201CElectrum doesn\u2019t have a bug that can be exploited, it cannot be controlled remotely. It has no open vulnerability that can cause loss without a user\u2019s action. Electrum was no more \u2018hacked\u2019 or \u2018exploited\u2019 than Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook and all financial institutions (banks, etc.) as well as various other online services are every day.\u201D","___\nLearn more:\nHackers Set Sights on Over USD 700m Bitcoin Wallet That Might Also Be Empty\nTrezor Fixes New Vulnerability, KeepKey Working On It; New Malware Targets Wallets\nPersonal Data Leaks In Crypto Are Inevitable, Here\u2019s What Can Be Done\nDiscovered Vulnerability Made Ledger to Choose Between \u2018Security and Usability\u2019"],"entity":[{"type":"Bitcoin Abuse Database website","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yahoo","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ZDNet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Avast","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Scam","Security","Wallet"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
