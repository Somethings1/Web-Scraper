As a result, the AA opted for a total reset, aiming to safeguard and advance the project\u2019s mission under a new, more focused leadership.","We have an important update for all stakeholders of the @AragonProject. We passed a resolution to:","\u2013 Deploy most of the treasury to allow all ANT holders to redeem their ANT for ETH\n\u2013 Dissolve the AA\n\u2013 Continue the mission in a product-focused structurehttps:\/\/t.co\/S0GjRtzhZJ","\u2014 Aragon Association (@AragonAssoc) November 2, 2023","","It was also influenced by years of experimentation with different governance initiatives, along with the challenge of balancing the Treasury\u2019s growth and the token\u2019s market cap.","The AA is set to send 86,343 Ether (ETH), valued at approximately $155 million, to a redemption contract on the Ethereum network. This deployment allows all ANT token holders to redeem their tokens for ETH at a fixed rate of 0.0025376 ETH per ANT.","The AA\u2019s objective is to redeem all outstanding circulating supplies. Token holders have until November 2, 2024, to participate in the redemption, after which this option will no longer be available.","At the end of the redemption period, the redeemed ANT will be burned, and any remaining ETH will be directed to a new product-focused structure.","However, the Aragon project\u2019s mission, centered on creating flexible and secure tools for decentralized organizations (DAOs), will continue under new leadership and a leaner, product-focused structure.","The new structure involves the formation of a Product Council consisting of industry experts who will guide the development and governance of Aragon\u2019s DAO framework. It will be seeded by representatives of the ASF and the Aragon OSx team. In addition, a company composed of the current Aragon OSx team will continue to develop products.","This reorganization is designed to empower those most aligned with the project\u2019s mission\u2014users and partners\u2014to take the lead. The Product Council will advise on product development priorities, allocate funds, and oversee the governance of Aragon OSx.","In 2017, Aragon conducted a successful ANT sale, raising 275,000 ETH (approximately $25 million) to fund its ambitious vision of creating a dispute resolution system within the Aragon Network, a new digital jurisdiction. The project\u2019s grants program, Aragon Nest, was initiated in 2018 and supported various projects within the Ethereum ecosystem.","Earlier this year, the \u201CRisk-Free Value (RFV) Raiders\u201D made a concerted effort to seize control of the Aragon treasury by acquiring ANT tokens and using their voting power to overrule the AA. The AA labeled this daring maneuver as a \u201C51% attack.\u201D","In response to this situation, the AA decided to pull plans to transfer governance power to tokenholders."],"entity":[{"type":"Aragon Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aragon Nest","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 2, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 2, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aragon\u2019s DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aragon OSx","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aragon Association (AA)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"51%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Aragon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aragon Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ASF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$155 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$25 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Product Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["DAO"],"authors":["Hassan Shittu"]}
