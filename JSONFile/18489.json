The ruling comes after the authority filed an emergency cease and desist order and accused the company of securities fraud.","Per the settlement agreement published Monday, the Texas regulator ordered Abra to return assets to Texans and other U.S. investors.","In June 2023, the Board accused Abra and related parties including its CEO, Bill Barhydt, ofÂ making misleading investment offers. The lender claimed itself as a \u201Ccrypto bank,\u201D promoting respondent Abra Boost as a \u201Cproduct which allows you to basically have crypto-based savings.\u201D","Further, the regulator also accused the plaintiffs including Plutus Financial, also controlled by Barhydt, for secretly transferring holdings to Binance.","The Monday settlement announcement noted that the ruling would address these frauds. \u201CThe settlement addresses their alleged offer and sale of interest\u2010bearing cryptocurrency depository products referred to as Abra Boost and Abra Earn.\u201D","The settlement will help investors to withdraw assets from their accounts. Additionally, the Board has ordered Abra to convert unclaimed assets to fiat currency before sending checks to Texas investors.","Commenting on the enforcement action, Texas Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles praised the state\u2019s \u201Cwell-equipped\u201D securities laws.","\u201CExisting securities laws are well equipped to protect investors purchasing traditional products such as stocks or bonds as well as new and innovative securities tied to digital assets and evolving technologies. I am pleased to see those tools effectively utilized in Texas.\u201D","According to the regulator\u2019s claims, Abra held cryptocurrencies worth $13.6 million on behalf of more than 12,000 U.S. investors. This includes crypto assets of 1,600 Texas residents that valued approximately $1.8 million.","Joe Rotunda, the Enforcement Director, noted that such heavy financial loses can have a \u201Cdevastating impact\u201D on investors\u2019 daily lives.","\u201CWhen settling this matter, we prioritized returning money to retail investors,\u201D Rotunda stressed. Further, the enforcement team has urged local investors to regularly check their mails for correspondence from the agency and instructions from Abra."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Abra Boost","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Plutus Financial","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Texas State Securities Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bill Barhydt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Joe Rotunda","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Barhydt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Board","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$13.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Travis J.
