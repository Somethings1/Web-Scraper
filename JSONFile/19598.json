It is the second most important hard fork since the Merge in September, particularly among investors who locked ETH tokens in the Beacon Chain Smart Contract.","Recently baptized Shapella, the Shanghai upgrade will see Ethereum unlock its full potential as a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol, as validators will for the first time withdraw from the staking contracts.","\u201CThere is much speculation about what the Shanghai hard fork will mean for the price action of ETH and related liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) such as Lido (LDO) and Rocket Pool (RPL). So far, we have seen large appreciations in the price for LSDs and related protocols,\u201D Bill Xing, head of financial products at Bybit said in an exclusive commentary to Cryptonews.","Like many experts in the market, expects the volatility being experienced to \u201Ccontinue leading up to and around the time the Shanghai upgrade is enacted, similar to the situation that unfolded around the time of The Merge in September 2022,\u201D Xing added.","Ethereum has been one of the biggest bullish contenders in the last few weeks. Unlike other altcoins, ETH has rallied alongside Bitcoin, allowing investors to hedge against the banking crisis in the US.","\u201CWe expect it to continue to play an important role going forward, primarily if it can deliver what is promised on its roadmap,\u201D Xing said as he concluded his statement.","However, the biggest challenge the Ethereum price faces at the moment is the risk associated with regulatory uncertainty in the US. If ETH can ignore the \u2018noise\u2019 it could ease into a substantial rally in 2023.","Buy Ethereum Now","Related Articles:",""],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Beacon Chain Smart Contract","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1,850","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"EMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$28,230","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bybit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Rocket Pool (RPL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1,807","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"MACD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bill Xing","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1,700","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1,800","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1,665","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"September 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ether","Ethereum"],"authors":["John Isige"]}
