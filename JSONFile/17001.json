Now crypto owners support Trump 48-39.","In a close election, this swing could be decisive. pic.twitter.com\/SusAdEW2pJ","\u2014 Justin Slaughter (@JBSDC) March 14, 2024","","Among the crypto community, 43% recalled voting for President Biden in 2020, while only 39% remembered voting for former President Trump. ","This suggests that some crypto owners who voted for Biden in the previous election may have switched allegiance due to actions taken by certain agencies in the Biden Administration. ","The report does not specify these actions but suggests that campaigns against \u201Cunregistered securities\u201D and concerns voiced by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about digital assets\u2019 impact on financial markets may have played a role.","The poll also revealed shifts in cryptocurrency ownership demographics. ","Ownership of crypto is higher among communities of color and younger individuals.","The report notes that 33% of African Americans and 32% of Hispanics currently own or have traded cryptocurrencies in 2024, compared to 20% and 22%, respectively, in the previous year. ","Paradigm concludes that the preferences of young and nonwhite voters are shifting, with the approach of policymakers toward crypto being one of their concerns.","The poll captured the market frenzy surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been credited with fueling the recent bull run. ","Approximately 6% of voters reported investing in crypto ETFs, with another 6% planning to do so. ","An additional 22% expressed the possibility of buying into a spot Bitcoin ETF.","The margin of error for the poll is 3.5%, indicating a reasonable level of confidence in the results. "," "],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Public Opinion Strategies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Virginia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Trump","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Janet Yellen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"32%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"42%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"22%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"49%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$68,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Joe Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 4","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"39","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Paradigm","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"3.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"43%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"45%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Biden Administration","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"33%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Republican Party","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$58,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 14, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Paradigm","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"48%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Trump","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Justin Slaughter","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Community","Donald Trump","Election"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
