Even 20 years from now. But I\u2019d like to get to a place where more than 50% of our revenue [comes from] subscriptions and services.\u201D","By \u201Csubscriptions and services,\u201D Armstrong was referring to paid Coinbase services, premium membership packages, staking, rewards programs, and the like.","As recent financial results have proved, exchanges like Coinbase rake in eye-watering profits when crypto prices rise, but it tends to get hard when prices stagnate and trading volumes drop.","As such, Coinbase no longer wants to rely so heavily on making hay when the bull market sun shines and toughing it out through prolonged crypto winters. Its CEO claimed that the firm was \u201Cinvesting today so much in subscription and services revenue\u201D and added that \u201Ca number\u201D of new services-related products were currently \u201Cin the works.\u201D","Armstrong\u2019s wish may be slowly coming true: while trading fee-derived income has taken a battering, Coinbase\u2019s latest quarterly financial report did have a subscription and services-themed silver lining. This part of the firm\u2019s income has grown in size and now represents some 18% of Coinbase\u2019s revenue. Only a year prior, that figure was just 4%.","But the ice-cold winds of crypto winter are not the only threat to Coinbase\u2019s dreams of success. Regulators continue to apply pressure on the company, and a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still a distinct possibility. The SEC may probe the firm over suspicions that many of the tokens Coinbase lists are securities. If this proves to be the case, Coinbase could find itself on the hook for enabling the sale of such tokens.","But Armstrong put a positive spin on the regulatory issue, stating:","\u201CWe\u2019ve been [\u2026] engaging with regulators and I actually think it\u2019s a good thing. And our overall goal is really to help drive regulatory clarity on a global scale.\u201D","On the subject of crypto winter, he repeated his mantra that business was \u201Cnever as good as it seems\u201D and \u201Cnever as bad as it seems.\u201D","Armstrong concluded:","\u201CI think one of the reasons Coinbase has been so successful in the last 10 years is [that] we try not to get focused on short-term ups and downs.\u201D","Meanwhile, Coinbase has revealed that the payments provider PayPal has joined its Travel Rule compliance platform, the Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST) network.","The Travel Rule is the brainchild of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and has been enshrined into law in multiple nations. It legally requires exchanges and other crypto intermediaries to relay sender data on high-value, inter-platform transactions.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Legal Woes: Coinbase Faces New Class Action, IRS Allowed to Investigate SFOX\u2019 Customers, Another Objection in SEC-Ripple War\n\u2013 Another Rough Quarter Awaits in Q3, Coinbase Warns After Bruising Financial Results\n\n\u2013 Professor Warns SEC That Its Move Against Coinbase Is a \u2018Serious Mistake\u2019\n\u2013 Coinbase Layoffs \u2018Part of a Larger Trend\u2019 In The Crypto Industry\n\n\u2013 Spending on US Crypto TV Ads Shrunk From USD 85M to USD 36K in 5 Months \u2013 Report\n\u2013 10 Traditional Companies that are Moving into Crypto Despite Market Downturn"],"entity":[{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase Faces New Class Action","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase Warns After Bruising Financial Results\n\n\u2013 Professor Warns SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"last 10 years","content":"DATE"},{"type":"IRS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Crypto TV Ads Shrunk From USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"18%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Armstrong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Action Task Force (FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Despite Market Downturn","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","Exchange","Fees","PayPal","Regulation","Trading"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
