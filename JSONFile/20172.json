He claims the tech giant\u2019s current system may not support offline payments for any European Central Bank digital currency.","The member, Piero Cipollone, outlined his concerns in a letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager dated April 19.","\u201CApple\u2019s proposed commitments would not give third parties full access to the secure element (SE), but only allow for the usage of Host Card Emulation (HCE),\u201D he said. For clarification, a secure element (SE) is a specialized chip engineered for enhanced security. It functions like a miniature safe within a device, commonly present in smartphones, tablets, and certain credit cards.","Also, he thinks Apple\u2019s proposal may not offer the same level of authentication and transaction speed as ApplePay.","Apple didn\u2019t return Cryptonews\u2019 request for comment by press time.","Cipollone added that currently, Apple\u2019s proposals don\u2019t ensure a fair level playing field for third-party payment solutions. This is especially true for in-store payments with iPhones. Were these proposals to be applied to a potential digital euro, they wouldn\u2019t guarantee user-friendly payments on iPhone, the economist said.","He also noted certain limitations with the EU\u2019s recent antitrust investigation into Apple. It doesn\u2019t address limited access to near-field communication (NFC) technology in various payment situations, including person-to-person payments, he said.","\u201CWe note that this use case is crucial for the digital euro,\u201D he said.","According to the economist, the proposed digital euro regulation requires device manufacturers and electronic communication service providers to offer fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory access to the secure element in their devices.","He said this access should be unrestricted and not reliant on other mobile operating system applications. This ensures that digital euro payments on mobile devices are user-friendly.","The European Commission has released draft laws outlining the groundwork for a potential digital euro. This includes establishing basic criteria and preparing necessary legislation for potential issuance.","In late 2023, the ECB initiated a two-year preparatory phase for the digital euro. This phase involves finalizing regulations, selecting private-sector collaborators, and conducting testing and experimentation."],"entity":[{"type":"Piero Cipollone","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Host Card Emulation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ECB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Margrethe Vestager","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Apple","Digital Euro"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
