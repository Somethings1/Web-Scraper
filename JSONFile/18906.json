VRF allows smart contracts to access tamper-proof random values while maintaining security.","The bug discovery comes amid Chainlink\u2019s increased institutional adoption of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) technology. Major traditional institutions like Swift, Vodafone and South Korea\u2019s largest gaming company have utilized Chainlink\u2019s technology in recent months.","According to Chainlink Labs, Obront and Cyngiser identified an issue where a malicious VRF subscription owner could potentially prevent users from getting proper randomness rolls by blocking and rerolling until a desired outcome occurred. The team categorized it as a critical smart contract vulnerability.","Although the conditions required to exploit this loophole were specific, it still compromised the core functionality of Chainlink VRF in providing transparent and verifiable on-chain randomness. The primary risk came from a compromised or malicious subscription owner, a role typically controlled by the decentralized app using VRF.","After consulting the researchers, Chainlink implemented a fix to guarantee randomness delivery even if the subscription owner tries exploiting the vulnerability. Obront and Cyngiser received $300,000 for responsibly disclosing the issue, positioning the bounty among the top 10 payouts in Immunefi\u2019s history.","üîêüõ°Ô∏è Big win for #BlockchainSecurity!

The network has paid out over $500,000 to date across 75+ resolved reports.","Crowdsourced audits on Code4rena have also been conducted to further strengthen security. The decentralized platform continues taking steps to secure its reputation for reliability and transparency amid growing adoption.","Chainlink\u2019s VRF is used by dApps like Axie Infinity, PancakeSwap, and Aavegotchi to protect smart contracts.¬†The company\u2019s CCIP allows communication between different blockchains, eliminating a major obstacle in decentralized finance. Its adoption by institutional giants like Swift and Vodafone for tokenization indicates growing trust in the technology.","With decentralized finance expanding rapidly, Chainlink\u2019s security and interoperability solutions are likely to see increased real-world application. Responsible disclosure and mitigation of issues like the recent VRF vulnerability will prove critical for maintaining reliability as use cases scale up."],"entity":[{"type":"Zach Obront","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 15, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Obront","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chainlink Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$300,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$300K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"VRF","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Vodafone","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Immunefi","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$500,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["DeFi"],"authors":["Trent Alan"]}
