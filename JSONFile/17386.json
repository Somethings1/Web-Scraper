It was the largest DeFi attack of 2022 and the hacker swapped wETH tokens with Ethereum, SOL, USDC, APE, SX, etc.","Later, Wormhole rewarded a white hacker with $10 million for rectifying a bug in its core bridge contract on Ethereum just after its platform was compromised in the cyber attack.","However, in February 2023, Web3 infrastructure firm Jump Crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Oasis.app executed a \u201Ccounter exploit\u201D on the Wormhole protocol hacker.
