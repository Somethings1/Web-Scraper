We didn\u2019t have a partnership,\u201D Lee told Bloomberg TV. ","Further, the Litecoin creator also said that not much can be done by the Litecoin Foundation about bad actors spreading fake news. He also reminded viewers that fake news that move markets are not exclusive to the crypto space, and that it is also a known phenomenon in the stock market.","\u201CThere is not much we can do. People can release fake news for cryptocurrencies all the time. Actually, this happens with traditional stock markets also, so it\u2019s not just in cryptocurrencies,\u201D Lee said.","Confronted with the possibility that it might have been someone on his end that was responsible for the fake press release, Lee denied any such possibility, saying \u201Cit\u2019s definitely not anyone on our end.\u201D ","He went on to explain that with litecoin being a decentralized cryptocurrency, \u201Cpretty much anyone\u201D can release fake news to pump the price.","Meanwhile, a separate Bloomberg report from Monday also said that both Walmart and GlobeNewswire \u2013 the distribution service that published the fake press release \u2013 are now working with authorities to investigate the matter and find out who was ultimately behind it.","According to the report, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has in the past gone after people for market manipulation via fake news, but this is often done by looking at who placed large stock trades around the time of the release. ","In the cryptocurrency market, tracking down these traders may prove more difficult.","Also covering the case on Monday was the New York Times, which said the hoax will \u201Clikely lead to a call for greater regulation of the cryptocurrency industry,\u201D while also quoting securities lawyers as saying that the event will most likely be investigated by the SEC.","\u201CIt is a misrepresentation involving a public issuer. There is no question the SEC has jurisdiction,\u201D Andrew Calamari, a lawyer with Finn Dixon & Herling and a former director of the SEC\u2019s securities and New York office, told the media outlet.","At 9:30 UTC, LTC is trading at USD 180. It\u2019s up nearly 4% in a day, and it\u2019s down 18% over the last week.","____","Learn more:","\u2013 Litecoin Pumps and Dumps on Fake Walmart News, Bitcoin, Ethereum React Too\n\u2013 13,000 South Korean ATMs to Enable Litecoin Withdrawals\n\n\u2013 FinTok & \u2018Finfluencers\u2019 Are On The Rise: 3 Tips To Assess Their Advice \n\u2013 Are Wall Street Giants Playing the \u2018Make-Bitcoin-Cheaper\u2019 Game Again? ","\u2013 Misinfo Over Gemini Bitcoin Inflow Reminds To DYOR \n\u2013 Are GameStop-Style Surges In Crypto Any Different From Old Pumps & Dumps? "],"entity":[{"type":"Charlie Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Walmart News","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Misinfo Over Gemini Bitcoin Inflow","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Litecoin Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg TV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Any Different From Old Pumps & Dumps","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andrew Calamari","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"18%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Finn Dixon & Herling","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Enable Litecoin Withdrawals\n\n\u2013 FinTok & \u2018Finfluencers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Walmart","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"LTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Fraud","Litecoin","Market","SEC"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
