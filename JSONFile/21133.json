The prime minister said that â\u20ACœdemocratic nations should work together on cryptocurrency to ensure it does not end up in the wrong hands.â\u20AC","This approach was also reflected in a Twitter post that was released on his account shortly after the speech. ","â\u20ACœTake cryptocurrency or bitcoin for example. It is important that all democratic nations work together on this and ensure it does not end up in [the] wrong hands, which can spoil our youth,â\u20AC the tweet said.","Modiâ\u20AC™s remarks come at a time when Indiaâ\u20AC™s government and lawmakers are discussing new regulations for cryptocurrencies, with local observers expecting relevant legislation to be developed during the winter session of the parliament which is to begin on November 29. ","Meanwhile, Clintonâ\u20AC™s remarks have drawn the ire of a number of social media users from the cryptosphere.","â\u20ACœMost people are buying crypto because price will increase, not to use as currency. And people using it as money very likely have no access to banks or countries with hyperinflation. Does she know the many other uses?â\u20AC wrote user Golden Crypto.","Another user, who goes by the name of AZchilly, commented that crypto actually â\u20ACœweakens the power of central banks and their ability to print currency to oblivion.â\u20AC","More reactions:","Hillary Clinton on crypto:\n\n\"\u2026 potential for undermining currencies, for undermining the role of the dollars as reserve currencies, for destabilizing nations\"\n\nUs: pic.twitter.com\/jlmpJkDklo","__",".@HillaryClinton is right.\n\nBitcoin has the potential to replace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency.\n\nNot so few, anymore. https:\/\/t.co\/rMr1Rx8AzF","__","She embodies \u201Cthe establishment\u201D.
