Simultaneously, the company is involved in federal regulatory and criminal cases linked to the incident. ","These legal efforts have significantly depleted a significant portion of the DAO\u2019s stablecoin treasury, which was originally valued at $15 million.","While Mango DAO\u2019s treasury holds around $89 million, most of these funds are in the form of MNGO tokens, which can not be easily liquidated. ","The primary source of potential funding for the legal expenses would likely come from a stash of dollar-linked stablecoins worth $15.3 million within the DAO\u2019s treasury, predominantly denominated in USDC.","Daffy Durairaj, the founder of Mango Labs, said that the additional funding is crucial to managing the legal costs associated with regulatory inquiries, cooperation with law enforcement, and pursuing claims against Avi Eisenberg to recover the DAO\u2019s funds. ","Despite facing pushback and the initial vote approaching rejection, Durairaj has initiated a second identical funding proposal.","It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, as Mango Markets attempts to navigate both the financial implications of the alleged exploit and the evolving landscape of crypto regulations. ","As the Mango DAO stakeholders grapple with these challenges, the broader crypto community watches closely, recognizing the significance of these events in shaping the future of decentralized financial platforms and their governance structures."],"entity":[{"type":"Mango DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$89 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$15.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Durairaj","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Daffy Durairaj","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mango Markets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mango DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Avi Eisenberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mango Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$110 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["DAO","Hack"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
