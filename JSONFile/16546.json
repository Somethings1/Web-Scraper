At the heart of it all was Lido Finance, a decentralized protocol that allowed traders to both earn rewards from Ethereum staking but also to get a liquid proxy token \u201CstETH\u201D they could trade in the meantime. Lido quickly surged to the top rank among decentralized finance or DeFi projects. But lately, Lido is experiencing growing pains \u2013 along with suspicion and resentment. We pull it all together in Network News.","Also:","You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk\u2019s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

As Ethereum transitioned over the past year to a fully functional proof-of-stake blockchain, market observers chronicled the staggering rise of Lido Finance, which effectively allows investors to stake their ether (ETH) \u2013 and thus earn rewards, yield \u2013 while also getting a token, stETH, that they can trade in the meantime. For many, that combination proved more attractive than the technically cumbersome job of setting up a validator and locking up ETH into the main blockchain. The problem now is that Lido has become too popular \u2013 bumping up against the 33% threshold of total ETH staked where the project could theoretically threaten the 67% supermajority needed to finalize transactions. Now, there are signs of pushback from the crypto community \u2013 as well as growing pains for Lido in managing such a sprawling operation. Late last week, voting closed among members of the Arbitrum network community on how to allocate an incentive program of 50 million ARB tokens (worth about $40 million), and Lido was denied in its application for 4 million ARB \u2013 seen as an expression of protest. \u201CThe Ethereum immune system is waking up,\u201D Evan Van Ness, publisher of Week in Ethereum News, posted on X. Defenders of Lido are quick to point out that the protocol has merely made the most of blockchain incentives and innovation, and that the real threat still comes from more centralized players, such as big crypto exchanges. \u201CThe fact of the matter is Lido has, and is heavily incentivized (as revealed in their growth) to act responsibly, and its presence elevates Ethereum decentralization, not contaminates,\u201D according to a Messari report. But there are also operational issues. Lido had to explain in a post-mortem analysis last week why 20 of its Ethereum validators recently got \u201Cslashed,\u201D or penalized: \u201CThe root cause of the slashing boiled down to executing non-optimal fallback procedures during datacenter connectivity issues.\u201D Got that? There was also the news that Lido has decided to sunset a separate staking service on the Solana blockchain; it was just too costly, with a $700,000 investment over the 2022-2023 budget and only $220,000 of revenue. \u201CIt was deemed a necessity for the success of the broader Lido protocol ecosystem,\" the project\u2019s developers wrote in a post. Resorting to the tourniquet might be a rare sign of weakness from the single most successful project in all of DeFi.","MAWR JOB CUTS. For the third straight week, reports of job cuts have filled the blockchain news headlines, offering further evidence of the economic toll of crypto winter. CoinDesk broke the news last week that CertiK, the blockchain code auditor, had made a \u201Cstrategic workforce adjustment\u201D impacting 30-40 people, or about 15% of the company\u2019s workforce. The recent cuts were made \u201Cin response to evolving market dynamics,\u201D according to the team. It was a harsh comedown, since the company CertiK raised nearly $150 million of fresh capital just last year. The Block reported last week that Parity Technologies, a primary developer of the Polkadot blockchain, would be \u201Csunsetting some of its existing go-to-market functions,\u201D and \u201Cimpacting staffing\u201D as a result. Transactions are down across the blockchain industry, and the crypto firm Galaxy noted in a research report that the \u201CVC fundraising environment remains extremely challenging,\u201D and that \u201Ca lack of significant new venture dollars will continue to pressure founders.\u201D","ALSO:","Tether freezes 32 blockchain addresses linked to terrorism and warfare in Israel and Ukraine, as U.S. Treasury Department targets Gaza crypto business in sanctions to squeeze Hamas.","Uniswap Labs, the key company building atop decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, will impose a 0.15% fee starting Tuesday on trades involving ETH, USDC and other tokens.

That problem may have temporarily resolved itself, thanks to what Coinbase analysts attributed to \u201Ca plateau in investor demand for Ethereum staking.\u201D As reported by CoinDesk\u2019s Krisztian Sandor, the once month-long queue of validators waiting to get onto the network has now basically been cleared out. One factor is that staking rewards have dropped significantly, to near 3.5% from 5%-6% earlier this year, due to tepid network activity to generate revenue from fees and the increasing number of stakers. That looks like a pretty paltry return for crypto, especially with traditional money market funds and old-fashioned, one-year U.S. Treasury bills yielding north of 5%.","The number of validators waiting to get onto the Ethereum blockchain has nearly cleared out.
