While the government did approach us for assistance on bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings.\u201D","The statement has sparked a furious backlash, as the World Bank itself is investing billions in fossil fuels, despite European officials\u2019 pleas to stop funding projects of this nature.","A Bloomberg article from April 1 contained evidence from the German environmental lobby group Urgewald that the World Bank had spent over USD 2bn on such projects in the past two years alone.","Other prominent crypto posters had their say, with @heavilyarmedc questioning what \u201Ctransparency concerns\u201D the organization could be referring to, as Bitcoin is \u201Cliterally a public ledger,\u201D and conceding that they were concerned about whether the news would \u201Cimpact El Salvador\u2019s steadfastness on the whole ordeal.\u201D","The Messari co-founder Dan McArdle also questioned the \u201Ctransparency\u201D claims, adding:","\u201CEnvironmental concerns are vastly overblown, though at least that\u2019s a complex topic. But transparency? The WorldBank [is] revealing a good deal of ignorance here.\u201D","The author and BTC commentator Jeff Booth was resolute, opining:","\u201CTrying to control a narrative through an outright lie and is going to blow up badly as more people find the truth, and as a result create an entirely new funding model and race to the free market over the bitcoin ecosystem.\u201D","And the crypto investor Anthony Pompliano went a step further, suggesting the reason for the statement was that \u201Cthe World Bank hasn\u2019t figured out how to make money off bitcoin.\u201D","Regardless, it appears El Salvador will not have to completely do it alone. Speaking to the state media, the Salvadoran Finance Minister and Treasury chief Alejandro Zelaya said that the government has held talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is \u201Cnot against\u201D BTC adoption per se.","And per La Prensa Gráfica, Zelaya confirmed that the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (the Banco Centroamericano de Integración Económica or BCIE) was onboard with its bitcoin adoption plans.","As reported, the BCIE chief stated that the organization was ready to \u201Cprovide technical assistance\u201D to El Salvador\u2019s finance chief and its central bank \u2013 and establish a \u201Cteam to work on the implementation.\u201D","And the BCIE appears to have already begun coming good with its claims. Zelaya stated that the organization had \u201Cunofficially\u201D sent a profile of one of the advisers who could provide El Salvador with technical assistance in the implementation of bitcoin.","The finance minister stated:","\u201CThere will be a multidisciplinary group that will work on the issue.\u201D","____\nLearn more: \n\u2013 El Salvador Gov\u2019t Mulls BTC Pay as Int\u2019l Bitcoin Players \u2018Roll into Town\u2019\n\u2013 JPMorgan on El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Move","\u2013 Bitcoin Beach Provides Clues about El Salvador\u2019s Greater BTC Intentions\n\u2013 Stakes Get Higher As El Salvador Offered Volcanic BTC Leverage In Talks With IMF","\u2013 El Salvador Brings New Global Puzzle \u2013 What Is Bitcoin & How To Tax It?\n\u2013 El Salvador, Paraguay Bitcoin Adoption News Galvanizes Crypto World"],"entity":[{"type":"International Monetary Fund (IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the World Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Banco Centroamericano de Integración Económica","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kristina Blokhin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Move","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Messari","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nayib Bukele","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"past two years","content":"DATE"},{"type":"El Salvador, Paraguay Bitcoin Adoption News Galvanizes Crypto World","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"World Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anthony Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Adobe","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alejandro Zelaya","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zelaya","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dan McArdle","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jeff Booth","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"La Prensa Gráfica","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador Offered Volcanic BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central American Bank for Economic Integration","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Beach Provides Clues","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador Gov\u2019t Mulls BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"El Salvador\u2019s Greater BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BCIE","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Anthony Pompliano","Banking","Bitcoin","El Salvador","Latin America","Mining","Transparency"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
