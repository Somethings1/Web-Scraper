But the max. effective staking amount (>32ETH) should mitigate that risk.","\u2014 Gabriel Weide (@AlphapingG) March 27, 2024","","Addressing the network\u2019s decentralization, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently proposed a mechanism to improve the system. ","In a blog post, Buterin suggested penalizing validators in proportion to their average failure rate. ","By implementing this approach, penalties would be higher if multiple validators fail within a given slot, potentially reducing the advantage of larger ETH stakers over smaller ones.","The SEC has recently postponed its decision on the applications for Ether (ETH) ETFs from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. ","The final deadlines for these decisions have been extended to May 2024. ","The SEC\u2019s decision to extend the deadline follows its earlier postponement in December 2023, during which it sought additional public input on whether the ETF should be listed. ","Grayscale had proposed listing and trading shares of its Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E in September 2023. ","Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have both expressed their calibrated predictions of the pending approvals, expecting a potentially persisting denial in May.","\u201COur odds of eth ETF approval by May deadline are down to 35%,\u201D stated Balchunas. ","\u201CI get all the reasons they SHOULD approve it (and we personally believe they should) but all the signs\/sources that were making us bullish 2.5mo out for btc spot are not there this time.\u201D","My cautiously optimistic attitude for ETH ETFs has changed from recent months. We now believe these will ultimately be denied May 23rd for this round. The SEC hasn't engaged with issuers on Ethereum specifics.
