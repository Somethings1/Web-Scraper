In the largely unregulated crypto market, however, the legality of the schemes is not a straightforward question, although Putnins suggested that it could fall under the scope of consumer protection rules.","Discussing what the harm is in pump and dump schemes, Putnins\u2019 presentation pointed out two main problems:","\u201CNo rational person (absent an advantage) would participate,\u201D the crypto researcher wrote about the expected negative outcome when trading fees are taken into account.","And although Putnins made the point that pump and dumps in crypto could well be illegal, it was when these schemes started to hit the Australian stock market that the regulator took action.","As explained in the presentation, back in October the ASIC infiltrated a group called \u201CASX Pump Organization.\u201D The regulator posted a message saying that coordinated pumping of shares for profits can be illegal.","\u201CWe\u2019re monitoring this platform and we may be investigating you,\u201D the message warned, adding that participants face the risk of fines of more than AUD 1m and prison time for their involvement in the scheme.","Further in the presentation, Putnins noted that \u201Cpumps are cyclical,\u201D and that the activity generally follows market sentiment in the crypto market. The tops in pump and dump activity until now have been in 2018 and 2021, which were years when the total crypto market capitalization reached massive peaks.","Cyclical trends in crypto pump and dump schemes:","In terms of the returns seen on the pumps, Putnins\u2019 presentation showed that most of the profits are generated immediately after the pump has started, with buyers who are in on the pump before it \u2018officially\u2019 starts having the best opportunity to profit.","After less than 30 minutes, the price of the coin being pumped is generally well below where it was before the pump started, the data showed.","Average pump and dump returns over time:","Further, the presentation also noted some key differences between modern pump and dumps in the crypto market and the more traditional type in stock markets, saying that the pump and dump groups of today are completely out in the open for anyone to find.","This differs strongly from the way it has traditionally worked in the stock market, where such groups have operated more or less underground, Putnins wrote.","Lastly, the report said that there is a perception that pumps in crypto are legal since the market is largely unregulated. It added that anonymity and encryption in online forums and messaging apps brings a level of comfort for participants, who often don\u2019t see any legal risk of being involved.","Meanwhile, the presentation Putnins did for the Australian financial watchdog is not the first time the professor has talked publicly about manipulation in the crypto market.","Back in August this year, the professor led a study where he identified 355 cases of pump and dumps in the crypto market, involving more than 23m participants, an article in The Australian Financial Review said, noting that this happens \u201Cin broad daylight as regulators and exchanges turn a blind eye.\u201D","____","Learn more:","\u2013 Crypto and Stock Market Link in Question After Fed Signals Tapering\n\u2013 Most Cryptos Correlated with Stocks, Not with Gold \u2013 Analysts\n\n\u2013 Aussie Regulatory Body Backs Government\u2019s Plan to Regulate Crypto\n\u2013 More Aussie Crypto Traders Profiting, Country Moving to Largest Reform of Payments Systems\n\n\u2013 How Global Economy Might Affect Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Crypto in 2022\n\u2013 Crypto Investment Trends in 2022: Brace for More Institutions and Meme Manias\n "," "],"entity":[{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ASX Pump Organization","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aussie Regulatory Body Backs Government","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ASIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"University of Technology Sydney","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Putnins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Investment Trends","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Talis Putnins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"August this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"The Australian Financial Review","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"December 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stock Market Link in Question After Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Australia","Cryptocurrency","Manipulation","Market","Regulation","Stocks"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
