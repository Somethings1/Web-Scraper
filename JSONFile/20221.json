But they are different from the rest of the pack solely because they're the only product on this list that is already operating as an ETF. So I'm not gonna read too much into that yet.","\u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 8, 2024","","Hashdex originally submitted its application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August of last year, proposing a futures investment vehicle that can also hold spot Bitcoin.","Additionally, Hashdex\u2019s ETF launch last year attracted attention from industry observers like Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who said it was notable that the application was \u201Cfiled under the 33 Act, which [Gensler] has said doesn\u2019t have enough [investor] protections vs [the] 40 Act.\u201D","This is a \u201Cgood sign for spot,\u201D Balchunas said at the time, referring to the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval.","The SEC is widely expected to greenlight applications from multiple ETF issuers to launch the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US this week, with many pointing to Wednesday January 10th as the most likely approval date."],"entity":[{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jeff Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hashdex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Eric Balchunas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"James Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Galaxy","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Seyffart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hashdex\u2019s Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"this week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Balchunas","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","ETF","Hashdex"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
