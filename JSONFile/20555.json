The regulator had set a deadline of February 29 for crypto exchanges to apply for operational licenses. Exchanges failing to submit their applications were required to cease operations in Hong Kong by May 31.","The SFC advised investors to act swiftly if they trade on platforms that do not appear on either the \u201Clist of licensed virtual asset trading platforms\u201D or the \u201Clist of virtual asset trading platform applicants.\u201D The regulator urged these investors to \u201Cmake preparations early,\u201D such as by closing their accounts. ","Among the 22 crypto trading platforms that applied for licenses, four had previously opted into the SFC\u2019s regulatory framework for crypto trading platforms.","Despite the SFC\u2019s efforts to disseminate information, Hong Kong continues to be faced with fake entities posing as legitimate crypto exchanges. The regulator warns of HKCEXP, the latest crypto exchange falsely claiming to be registered with the regulator.","The SFC accused HKCEXP of providing a fraudulent Hong Kong address for registration. Additionally, one Hong Kong citizen who had used the platform reported to the SFC that the exchange imposed excessive fees for fund withdrawals.","The SFC will maintain a public list of licensed crypto platforms to promote safe crypto trading. The SFC stated that any exchange that fails to apply for licensing faces restrictions on operations and marketing activities in Hong Kong.","According to the SFC, 22 exchanges have submitted applications before the February 29 deadline. Among these applicants are prominent names in the crypto industry, such as OKX, Bybit, Bullish, Crypto.com, Huobi HK, Matrixport HK, and Gate.HK. ","The HKVAEX crypto platform, reportedly associated with Binance, has also submitted its application for consideration.
