Not everyone thinks this is a good development for crypto markets, however.","Under the proposal, Hong Kong will require stablecoin issuers to obtain local licensing and comply with governance, risk management, and anti-money laundering\/counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) standards. The regulators stated that only coins issued by licensed firms could be offered to retail investors.","Additionally, licensed entities must establish a Hong Kong-based leadership team and maintain high-quality, segregated reserves. The public can submit feedback on the proposal until February 29, 2024.","Hong Kong lawmaker Johnny Ng highlighted concerns about the policy on X. He noted that major global stablecoins like USDT and USDC already circulate without local licensing.","Ng questioned how these international coins could be traded on licensed Hong Kong exchanges under the new rules. Failure to address this could reduce trading volumes and disrupt transactions, sparking unintended consequences.","The lawmaker also pointed to ambiguity around potential transaction fees and stablecoin applications under the regulations.","‚ö†Ô∏è JUST IN \u2013 Hong Kong really wants to take back the #crypto hub üëë üòÖ","HK FSTB and HKMA (HK \u201Ccentral bank\u201D) just published a consultation paper on the legislative proposal to implement the regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in HK üëÄ https:\/\/t.co\/frzIigqp6R https:\/\/t.co\/CzRMIlHmcC pic.twitter.com\/CKaLPUCfok","\u2014 JustDario üèä\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è (@DarioCpx) December 27, 2023","","Hong Kong has actively pursued cryptocurrency-friendly policies to become a crypto and Web3 hub.","Last week, the city\u2019s regulators indicated their readiness to approve spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This would allow listings of ETFs tracking crypto assets on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.","Hong Kong issued its first virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses in August. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) granted licenses to OSL¬†and¬†HashKey.","Finding a middle ground may require compromise and additional policy work, however. Hong Kong has shown a proactive stance in welcoming cryptocurrencies, which could set an influential precedent.","Unfortunately, Ng\u2019s critiques highlight the challenges of designing rules for a complex global crypto asset market, and hint that Hong Kong\u2019s government may be acting counter to its seeming desire to be welcoming to the crypto industry. As countries around the world eye potential stablecoin frameworks, Hong Kong\u2019s experience could offer important lessons on managing risks while enabling responsible innovation."],"entity":[{"type":"Hong Kong Stock Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Futures Commission (SFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Johnny Ng","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"VASP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December 27, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Financial Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"OSL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 29, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Treasury Bureau","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"HKMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Crypto Regulation","Hong Kong crypto","stablecoin regulation"],"authors":["Trent Alan"]}
