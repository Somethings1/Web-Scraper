It plans to expand its efforts to include system design as well.","\u201CWe\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time talking to a wide variety of Bitcoin miners to identify the challenges faced by mining operators,\u201D the announcement reads.","\u201CBuilding on these insights and pursuant to our goal of supporting mining decentralization, we plan to offer both a standalone mining chip as well as a full mining system of our own design.\u201D","Concerns over network stability and hardware vulnerabilities have long plagued the Bitcoin community. ","The ASIC chips used in mining rigs are predominantly manufactured in China, a country that has exhibited hostility towards the cryptocurrency sector. ","Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block initiative aims to decentralize the supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate, which serves as a measure of industry competition and mining difficulty.","One major obstacle that Block seeks to overcome is the limited availability and high cost of mining rigs. ","Additionally, the company aims to improve the user experience and reliability of mining operations, addressing common issues such as heat dissipation and noise production.","While specific details regarding the mining system are scarce in the announcement, Dorsey had previously mentioned the possibility of a \u201CBitcoin mining system based on custom silicon.\u201D ","He also emphasized the need for more vertical integration and diversification in silicon design, which he believes is currently concentrated among a few companies.","The latest development comes shortly after the most recent Bitcoin halving, which occurred recently and reduced the issuance of new Bitcoin by half. ","Dorsey\u2019s vision of accessible mining extends beyond generating new Bitcoin. ","\u201CMining needs to be more distributed. The more decentralized this is, the more resilient the bitcoin network becomes.\u201D","Square is considering building a Bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses worldwide. If we do this, we\u2019d follow our hardware wallet model: build in the open in collaboration with the community. First some thoughts and questions.","\u2014 jack (@jack) October 15, 2021","","Block\u2019s venture arm has also backed Gridless, a company operating Bitcoin mines powered by renewable energy sources in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia. ","As reported, Gridless has found an innovative way to power its operations and bring electricity to rural homes. ","Located near Hell\u2019s Gate National Park, it has set up shop at the site of an extinct volcano, where the company utilizes a mobile container equipped with solar power and energy from a nearby geothermal site. ","Gridless operates six mines across Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, all powered by a combination of renewable energy sources. ","Bitcoin mining has faced criticism due to its energy consumption. However, when coupled with renewable energy sources, it can help unlock trapped renewable power and incentivize increased production.","Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers, utilizing excess power from renewable sources and providing financial incentives for further development."],"entity":[{"type":"October 15, 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kenya","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zambia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Malawi","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gridless","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hell\u2019s Gate National Park","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Mining","Block","Jack Dorsey"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
