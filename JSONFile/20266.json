This move could prevent a lengthy trial if the judge rules in Terraform\u2019s favor.","In the motion, Terraform Labs and Do Kwon assert that the SEC has failed to provide ample evidence for their claims. They stated, \u201CAfter two years of investigation, the completion of a discovery period that resulted in the taking of more than 20 depositions, and the exchange of over two million pages of documents and data, the SEC is evidentiarily no closer to proving that the defendants did anything wrong.\u201D","Terraform Labs directed their motion for summary judgment to Jed Rakoff, the judge at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, aiming for a swift resolution. However, Terraform\u2019s last attempt did not land well as Rakoff dismissed Terraform\u2019s previous motion to have the lawsuit thrown out, siding with the SEC\u2019s argument that there might be a \u201Cplausible claim\u201D regarding Terraform\u2019s potential violation of securities law. Rakoff also rejected using a recent ruling as a precedent which determined that Ripple Labs did not violate any securities law.","The fallout from a $40 billion loss in 2022 placed Terraform in the vanguard of crypto firms facing adversities, now clashing with the SEC over pivotal industry concerns. Post the collapses of its TerraUSD (UST) and LUNA, the SEC sued Terraform Labs and Do Kwon, alleging that both the Anchor Protocol and the LUNA token are \u201Ccrypto asset securities,\u201D thus Terraform was selling unregistered securities and security-based swap and violated respective regulations.","Kwon is now detained in Montenegro while the U.S. and South Korea have requested his extradition. Kwon\u2019s lawyers urged the court to reject such requests to extradite Kwon to the U.S. Meanwhile, Terraform Labs co-founder Daniel Shin is confronting his own set of fraud charges in South Korea.","The SEC declined to comment on Terraform\u2019s summary judgement request."],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$40 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Terraform Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rakoff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"LUNA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"the Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Daniel Shin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jed Rakoff","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Do Kwon","Luna","Ripple","SEC"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
