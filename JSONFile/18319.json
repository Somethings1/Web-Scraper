In an official government release, the National Securities Commission of Argentina (CNV) called its new registry of crypto exchanges and service providers \u201Csimple.\u201D","It also claimed the registry does away with \u201Cformalities and absurdities.\u201D","","Argentina\u2019s rate of crypto adoption has accelerated in recent years in response to rampant inflation. Previous governments have attempted to cap foreign currency buying. This has driven many people in the nation to stablecoins and cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC). And although the nation\u2019s President Javier Milei has spoken out in favor of BTC in the past, Buenos Aires remains dependent on financial support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).","Milei wants to improve Argentina's primary balance by 5.5% of GDP quickly. Almost no IMF program in history did that. The typical program achieves just 1% of GDP in adjustment. Macri tried 4.8% in late 2018 and everything blew up. History will repeat itself. pic.twitter.com\/SnihsMdD7t","\u2014 Sergi Lanau (@SergiLanauOE) March 27, 2024","","The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has warned Argentina that it may be placed on the\nFATF \u201Cgrey list\u201D if it fails to police its crypto exchanges. Last month, media outlets in the nation reported that Buenos Aires had \u201Ccaved in\u201D to FATF demands out of concern the IMF may withhold support.","Senators fast-tracked a bill that laid down the legal framework for exchange regulation. The CNV responded four days later with formal plans for a \u201Cregistry of crypto operators.\u201D But the CNV now appears keen to strike a conciliatory note with domestic crypto firms, who have warned of \u201Cencroaching\u201D regulation.","The CNV and its President Roberto Silva held a meeting with legal representatives and members of the Argentine Fintech Chamber, Criptonoticias reported on April 2.","The CNV President Roberto Silva speaks at a meeting with domestic crypto and blockchain leaders. The CNV President Roberto Silva speaks at a meeting with domestic crypto and blockchain leaders.","Silva said he would endeavor to \u201Clisten to\u201D and \u201Cunderstand\u201D the needs of crypto companies before \u201Cmoving forward\u201D with more regulation.","He said that it was important for regulators and the private sector to \u201Cwork together,\u201D adding:","\u201CWe will listen to them. We will make every effort to understand them. And then we will\ndecide how best way to guarantee compliance with the objectives of [FATF standards]. We\nwill try not to hinder the activity of [crypto firms].\u201D","","The CNV chief promised to incorporate the \u201Cderegulation promoted by the national government,\u201D but insisted that the regulator would \u201Ctake the mandate of the law into account.\u201D","Under the CNV\u2019s plans, all virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including exchanges, wallet providers, and crypto payment gateways, must apply for operating permits. Those firms that fail to do so face possible criminal prosecution. And, as is the case in many other nations that adhere to FATF crypto guidelines, overseas firms that target domestic users will also need to apply for permits.","The move has led many to accuse Milei of betraying them. The President famously took to the streets with a toy chainsaw to\nsymbolize what he intended to do with overly constrictive laws.","He also destroyed a piñata effigy of the nation\u2019s Central Bank on national television leading many to believe he would do away with financial regulation \u2013 not beef them up.","Argentina\u2019s sequential inflation is definitely easing after the post-deval shock, but it\u2019s nowhere close to the levels that would justify rate cuts https:\/\/t.co\/xeeGCkxzM8 pic.twitter.com\/Yd9sLh4HlO","\u2014 Natalia Gurushina (@NGurushina) March 12, 2024","","However, others argue that Argentina needs crypto regulation to help legitimize the sector, build trust, and protect investors from scams. Argentina\u2019s crypto regulation journey began in 2014, when the Financial Information Unit began calling upon citizens to report their crypto-related operations.","The government launched a crypto tax system in 2017, and in 2019, began asking exchanges to submit monthly reports on their activities."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"International Monetary Fund (IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"IMF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Roberto Silva","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Natalia Gurushina","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Argentina","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Javier Milei","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Buenos Aires","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 27, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"4.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"April 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"5.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 12, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CNV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Information Unit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Silva","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Macri","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"National Securities Commission of Argentina (CNV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Action Task Force (FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Buenos Aires","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fintech Chamber","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Argentina","Crypto Regulations"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
