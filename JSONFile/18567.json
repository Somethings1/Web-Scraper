It aims to outperform existing blockchains in transaction processing without compromising on cost-effectiveness.Solana achieves this through a unique Layer 1 network architecture, allowing it to handle over 710,000 transactions per second (TPS).","This architecture also facilitates the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), making it suitable for various use cases like decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) marketplaces.","Launched in 2020 after extensive testing, Solana stands out from platforms like Ethereum by avoiding the need for additional scaling solutions. Instead, it utilizes powerful and fast computers to maintain the network and manage data storage. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, plays a crucial role in enabling transactions and securing the network through staking.","This report provides a comprehensive overview of the Solana ecosystem in February 2024, analyzing SOL price performance, ecosystem developments, and updates.","Solana\u2019s daily transaction volume has seen a significant increase, rising from 22.1 million on Feb. 6 to 33.7 million on Feb. 26. This rise in activity suggests growing engagement and use of the Solana blockchain. However, by the end of the month, the daily transaction volume dropped once more, reaching 28.5 million.","<\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has reached $2.5 billion, which represents a 30% increase year-to-date. In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s TVL grew by 15% during the same period, and BNB Chain saw a 12% increase in BNB deposits since Dec. 31, 2023.","While transaction processing took a big hit on February 6, as the Solana network suffered a 5-hour outage, the market correction was quick, and activity resumed in full force shortly after the outage was resolved.","The outage of Solana\u2019s Mainnet was caused by a complication with legacy programs, as detailed in Solana\u2019s comprehensive report compiled by Anza.","Engineers from across the ecosystem are investigating an outage on mainnet-beta. This thread will be updated as more information becomes available https:\/\/t.co\/rfeioQ6BG9","\u2014 Solana Status (@SolanaStatus) February 6, 2024","","SOL is the native cryptocurrency fueling the Solana ecosystem, used for transaction fees and staking to secure the network, with its value influenced by the ecosystem\u2019s growth and market dynamics.","The SOL price fluctuated throughout February. After dropping to $95 on Feb. 4, it rebounded by more than 27%, reaching about $130 by the end of the month.","Two factors fueled SOL\u2019s price increase: various airdrops and the network\u2019s perceived advantages in terms of affordability and ease of use compared to its competitors.","Despite its recent outage, Solana boasts faster development and upgrade implementation compared to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks. While the February outage caused exchanges to halt SOL and Solana SPL token transactions and impacted DApp usage, it didn\u2019t significantly affect the SOL price, potentially due to Solana\u2019s faster development cycles.","Solana Mobile\u2019s Chapter 2 smartphone reached 100,000 preorders on Feb. 12, less than 30 days after registration was opened. The smartphones will start shipping in early 2025. In comparison, it took Solana almost a year to sell 20,000 of its first Solana Saga smartphones.","100,000 preorders in less than 30 days 🔥","We\u2019re floored by the demand and truly grateful for the overwhelming support💪","Now that we\u2019ve hit this milestone, the Founder Window & preorder price of $450 will close in 48 hours. Your chance to join is now!","👉 https:\/\/t.co\/nYR9apGGIT pic.twitter.com\/9L224igXcL","\u2014 Solana Mobile 2️\u20E3 (@solanamobile) February 12, 2024","","\u200B\u200BHelius, a platform developing tools for Solana blockchain developers, secured $9.5 million in funding. The company plans to use the funds to hire more engineers, improve its technology, and onboard more developers to the Solana ecosystem.","Tools for Humanity, the main developer behind the Worldcoin project, announced the acquisition of Ottr Finance, a Solana-based digital wallet startup. Ottr Wallet will cease operations as the company focuses on supporting Tools for Humanity in building the Worldcoin project.","Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, CMCC Global and 468 Capital participated in a $25-million Series A investment in crypto mobile payment firm Oobit. Oobit wants to make it easier for consumers to purchase goods and services using cryptocurrency.","Solana also collaborated with Filecoin, a decentralized data storage marketplace, to enhance the reliability and scalability of the Solana blockchain. As part of the partnership, Solana will leverage Filecoin\u2019s infrastructure to improve data redundancy, scalability and security while reinforcing Solana\u2019s commitment to decentralization.","Solana's integration with #Filecoin is a significant move away from centralized storage solutions and a remarkable step towards enhancing the reliability and scalability of the Solana blockchain.@solana is utilizing Filecoin to make its block history more accessible and usable\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/1NcuaLNYT5","\u2014 Filecoin (@Filecoin) February 16, 2024","","Moreover, the Solana Foundation launched a global hackathon called Renaissance for Web3 developers as well. The hackathon will take place from March 4 to April 8, 2024, and participants can compete for a share of a $1 million prize pool and pre-seed funding.","Following SOL\u2019s price gains, several meme coins built on the Solana blockchain, including Bonk (BONK) and DogWifHat (WIF), also saw significant increases in trading activity during the last week of February.","The prices of BONK and WIF grew by 110% and 250%, respectively, since Feb. 23, reaching $0.00002364 and $0.856420 on Feb. 29. The BONK price saw an uptick following the news about a possible listing on the Revolut trading platform.","The proposed collaboration would see Revolut launch a \u201CLearn and Earn Campaign\u201D aimed at attracting 500,000 new users to the Bonk ecosystem. With 38 million users in over 50 countries, Revolut\u2019s involvement could significantly expand Bonk\u2019s user base if the partnership is realized.","#Revolut plans to list #BONK and launch a $1.2M campaign to educate users about the meme coin.

Its TVL stood at an impressive $182,7 million on Feb. 29.","Parcl announced the launch of its governance and utility token, PRCL, with a focus on community engagement and future protocol functions. Moreover, Parcl experienced significant growth, boasting over 140,000 users and $111.2 million in TVL.","Zeta also announced its upcoming token launch in April. The project\u2019s recent $8.5 million Series A funding round led by Jump Capital highlights the significant potential of the upcoming airdrop. This news, along with the already mentioned airdrop announcements from Drift and Parcl, makes April a promising month for Solana ecosystem participants.","Io.net, a Solana-based decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) project focused on sourcing GPU computing power, also unveiled a rewards program in anticipation of its token launch.","Marginfi, a decentralized lending protocol on Solana with a TVL of $533,5 million, announced the completion of early development for its decentralized stablecoin, YBX, which is set to launch on the main net in late March.","1\/ Introducing $YBX","A yield-bearing asset to capture base layer monetary policy","Here's how it works🧵 pic.twitter.com\/JNKAd4GyfY","\u2014 marginfi ◼️ (@marginfi) February 28, 2024","","Jupiter Exchange, the largest DEX aggregator on Solana, opened its LFG launchpad for applications.
