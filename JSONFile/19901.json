From the platform\u2019s main page, the average transaction cost is less than $0.01.","Moreover, connecting with Ethereum will allow developers to deploy their solutions on Injective Protocol. The inEVM merges the high performance in Injective with the depth of developer tools present in Ethereum.","By enabling multiple virtual machines, inEVM can process transactions faster and handle more users. This enhancement is key because Injective Protocol aims to take on centralized exchanges like Bybit and Binance. The decentralized platform supports, among other features, margin trading and perpetual swaps.","With the launch of inEVM, the number of Injective Protocol users is expected to surge, translating to more transactions. As of early March 2024, Injective reported processing approximately half a billion on-chain transactions.","Nearing half a billion on-chain transactions ‚è≥ https:\/\/t.co\/ObrfGbMVuP","\u2014 Injective ü•∑ (@injective) March 3, 2024","","Over the past few months, INJ, the native currency of the protocol, has been one of the top performers.
