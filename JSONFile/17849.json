Neither were due until Jan 1, 2024.","Maybe just clearing the queue before the holidays? pic.twitter.com\/LdZQxGh43L","\u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 18, 2023","","The SEC also delayed decisions on spot Ethereum ETF applications from VanEck, ARK Invest and 21Shares.","As per Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst James Seyffart, these delays were expected to come in before the 25th of December.","The SEC said that they chose to delay the decision to allow more time to gather public input surrounding whether the ETFs should be listed.","While the SEC has in the past approved Ether futures ETFs, it is yet to approve any spot Ether ETFs, or mixed Ether ETFs \u2013 Hashdex\u2019s proposed ETF would aim to hold both Ether futures and spot Ether.","Grayscale\u2019s ETF proposal, meanwhile, only aims to hold Ether futures, but some analysts have claimed that Grayscale are attempting to use the ETF application as a \u201Ctrojan horse\u201D to force the SEC into eventually allowing them set up a spot Ether ETF.","Ether\u2019s latest strong price bounce from Monday\u2019s lows near-$2,100 shows that, for now, the key long-term support level around $2,150 remains intact.","Moreover, if Ether is able to hold above its 21DMA, which it is currently grappling with, that would suggest that the short-term bullish market trend remains intact.","Whilst Ether ETFs may have been delayed this week by the SEC, asset managers have continued filing amendments to their spot Bitcoin ETFs with the agency, a sign that dialogue continues and near-term approvals are very likely.","That, as well as aforementioned macro tailwinds, could help the crypto market continue trading with a positive bias into the year\u2019s end.","It is notable, however, that Ether appears to be forming a bearish descending triangle structure.","A break below here could trigger a short-term setback to the price and dip back below $2,000.","","An exciting new decentralized Bitcoin mining protocol called Bitcoin Minetrix is generating a lot of hype, and has already raised over $850,000 in funds from early investors into its $BTCMTX token presale.","$BTCMTX is the token that powers the protocol \u2013 investors who buy $BTCMTX can then stake their tokens to start earning non-transferable Bitcoin Minetrix mining credits.","These credits can then be burnt by their owners, and in exchange, they will get a share in Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Bitcoin mining revenues.","$BTCMTX token holders will also earn $BTCMTX rewards, with a portion of the token supply already set aside to reward early stakers.","Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s protocol is governed by smart contracts built on top of the decentralized Ethereum blockchain, which is also where its token is issued.","The protocol thus offers better transparency and security versus other centralized cloud mining services.","Check Out Bitcoin Minetrix Here","Disclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.
