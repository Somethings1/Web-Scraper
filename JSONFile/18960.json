But I do generally test positive for dysthymia [a form of mild, long-term depression], and anhedonia [the inability to feel pleasure]. My lows aren\u2019t unusually low \u2013 but I generally don\u2019t have highs.\u201D","Last week, the New York Times published highlights from 250 pages of similar draft tweets, which were leaked by social media personality and Bankman-Fried\u2019s confidante, Tiffany Fong. ","Bankman-Fried\u2019s tweets indicate that he first became aware of his mental health issues during high school, describing a lack of happiness and an inability to comprehend the concept. ","He revealed that he had been prescribed an antidepressant called EmSam for the past decade to help manage his mental well-being. ","Bankman-Fried was an advocate for EmSam and even hired a psychiatrist as a company coach, who allegedly liberally dispensed prescriptions to FTX employees, according to Department of Justice attorneys.","While in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorney raised concerns about his access to prescription drugs, claiming that he was not receiving his Adderall and was worried about running out of EmSam. ","Additionally, his vegan dietary restrictions were not considered, resulting in a limited diet consisting mainly of bread, water, and peanut butter.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s unpublished tweets portray a detachment from material possessions and a lack of belief that they would bring him happiness. ","\u201CI\u2019ve never really been into fancy things. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s because it would be selfish, but honestly a lot of it is because fancy things won\u2019t make me happy anyway. Because nothing will,\u201D Bankman-Fried wrote.","He also expressed remorse for what happened in the unpublished tweets and committed to providing value to FTX customers.","The Department of Justice has attempted to prevent Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys from presenting a mental disease defense, arguing that they were not given proper notice before the deadline.","Last month, the agency argued that questions related to effective altruism were not only unnecessary but also an attempt to shape a defense narrative suggesting that the defendant was accumulating wealth to improve the world. ","They also deemed questions about Bankman-Fried\u2019s ADHD and related medication as irrelevant and prejudicial, emphasizing that no notice of a mental disease or condition defense had been provided within the court\u2019s imposed deadline.","Both Bankman-Fried and the DOJ have submitted voir dire questions, which were intended to identify if any of the possible jurors are familiar with the case, specifically with crypto or with effective altruism.","One of the suggested questions asked \u201CIf a company involved in the cryptocurrency industry or the financial industry fails, do you feel that only the owners of the company must be to blame?\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brooklyn","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tiffany Fong","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["FTX","Legal","Sam Bankman-Fried"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
