It said that it asked \u201Cthe general public and representatives of the public and private sectors\u201D for their CBDC-related opinions.","The BCCh said almost 90% of survey respondents had \u201Ca favorable attitude toward CBDC\u201D pilots.","The bank said that \u201Cthe main objective of the PoC\u201D tests will be \u201Cgaining experience with technologies related to digital currencies.\u201D","BCCh officials said initial tests would be conducted internally, without private sector support.","The bank added that it would only seek \u201Cexternal support\u201D when it was ready to start real-world tests or roll out the coin.","Alberto Naudon, an advisor to the central bank, said that it was unlikely that a Chilean CBDC would face much competition from \u201Cso-called cryptocurrencies.\u201D","Naudon said there was a very small probability that Bitcoin (BTC) or other tokens could be \u201Cused as money or a means of payment on a massive scale.\u201D","Instead, he said that a digital peso would likely face more competition from stablecoins, some of which are \u201Cbacked by large companies.\u201D","Naudon said that \u201Cdue to their characteristics,\u201D stablecoins \u201Cclearly have the potential\u201D to achieve \u201Csignificant mass adoption.\u201D","The media outlet noted that \u201Cin many countries\u201D in the Latin American region, people use USD-pegged coins \u201Cmore widely than BTC.\u201D","The bank appears, like many of its international counterparts, to have made something of a U-turn on CBDC policy.","Chile\u2019s central bank President Rosanna Costa said plans to extend one of the world\u2019s biggest rate-cutting cycles remain intact as policymakers have already incorporated new global risks into their outlook https:\/\/t.co\/0KJTua1Qiu","\u2014 Bloomberg Economics (@economics) April 20, 2024","","Back in 2022, the BCCh began and then abandoned a CBDC project, unsure that it would benefit the nation to press ahead with a digital peso rollout.","But the bank appears to have changed its tune in 2024, claiming that the response to its survey had convinced it to try again with the CBDC project.","The bank said it was moving \u201Cin line with the majority of the world\u2019s central banks.\u201D","Scores of nations worldwide, including most major countries in the LATAM region, are either set to roll out CBDCs or are actively researching digital fiat projects."],"entity":[{"type":"Criptonoticias","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Central Bank of Chile (","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg Economics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chile","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 20, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alberto Naudon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rosanna Costa","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Naudon","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["CBDC","Latin America"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
