The more I pondered it today the more I had same thought. Wonder what happened","\u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 13, 2024","","In late January, ETF provider Global X also pulled its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.","After facing resistance from the SEC in its initial attempt to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, Global X faced further delays upon refiling in Aug. 2023.","Global X missed the final list of potential ETFs due to documentation issues, but it\u2019s not the only one that came up short. Pando Asset Management and 7RCC are also waiting for approval for their spot bitcoin ETFs.","Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to hover around $72,000, up by more than 50% over the past month. ","The leading cryptocurrency has recently registered an all-time high of $72,953.","Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed the decision to approve options trading on spot Bitcoin ETFs.","The agency extended the response deadline for the Cboe Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange, both of which filed bids to offer options on Bitcoin ETFs. ","Analysts, such as VettaFi\u2019s Dave Nadig, predict that the introduction of BTC ETF options will attract hedge fund players who were not previously involved in the crypto ecosystem, providing them with an opportunity to participate in the market.","Multiple leveraged Bitcoin ETFs are also under consideration by the SEC, including filings from asset manager Direxion for five inverse and long spot BTC ETFs, ProShares\u2019 five leveraged Bitcoin funds, and REX Shares\u2019 six leveraged ETFs.","It is worth noting that Bitcoin ETFs have experienced the most successful launch in the history of ETFs.","These products accumulated over 30,000 BTC in the previous week alone, currently holding close to $30 billion.","If this trend continues, it could create a new phenomenon where the demand for Bitcoin surpasses the available supply, effectively creating a Bitcoin ETF liquidity crisis. "],"entity":[{"type":"January 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 13, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Anthony Scaramucci","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Pando Asset Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Trust SkyBridge Bitcoin ETF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SkyBridge","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$72,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Cboe Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Miami International Securities Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Direxion","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eric Balchunas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SkyBridge Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aug. 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$72,953","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dave Nadig","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"White House Communications","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$30 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["SEC","Spot ETFs","USA"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
