As the internet and social network rise, money, business, creativity & the ways one manages them are shifting. Creatives and influencers monetizing their personal content and data have now become more valuable than some traditional industries.\u201D","According to the artist, his practice addresses contemporary subjects such as influence marketing, high-speed media channels and contemporary devices.","The development comes just over a month after another individual announced news of a \u201Cself-tokenization\u201D of sorts \u2013 a \u201Chuman IPO\u201D of Ethereum-powered tokens in a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, a project that, per Etherscan data, appears to be relatively active.","Elliot\u2019s move is just the latest in a long line of blockchain and crypto-powered business-technology-art collaborations that is already starting to bear fruit.","Earlier this year, Cryptonews.com reported that a Dutch company exhibiting at CES claimed that it had won EU regulatory approval for a platform that will allow artists and collectors to convert the ownership of art into digital certificates.","And last year Cryptonews.com reported that in Japan, an art-meets-blockchain startup named StartBahn that allows artists to register and sell their work had received investment boosts from financial group SBI\u2019s art trading subsidiary SBI Art Auction.","Efforts to build a cross-industry, cross-media blockchain arts platform are also in development in Japan, where manga and anime-themed artwork has been available via blockchain and crypto platforms for several years."],"entity":[{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Paris","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CES","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elliot","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ben Elliot","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Adoption","Art","Blockchain","Tokenization"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
