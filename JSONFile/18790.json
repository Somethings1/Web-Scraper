They aim for a launch just after Chinese New Year, which will run from Feb. 10 to Feb. 17 this year.","Harvest Fund Management is primarily a Chinese asset management firm offering services to pension and profit-sharing plans, insurance companies, and enterprises. As of 2021, the fund managed assets worth $121b.","On January 26, Harvest Hong Kong, one of China\u2019s largest fund companies, submitted a Bitcoin spot ETF application to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. This is the first institution in Hong Kong to submit a Bitcoin spot ETF application. https:\/\/t.co\/UgMfQ6G8xQ","\u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 29, 2024","","Harvest didn\u2019t return Cryptonews\u2019 request for comment by press time, while the SFC declined to comment.","This development follows the US SEC\u2019s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, marking a significant milestone for the industry following earlier rejections.","BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, VanEck\u2019s HODL, and Grayscale\u2019s GBTC were among notable approvals.","Hong Kong is also prepared to follow the US\u2019 trend. In December, the SFC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority jointly announced their readiness to accept applications for virtual asset spot ETFs. Additionally, they outlined the expected standard of conduct for intermediaries distributing these funds.","Hong Kong crypto leaders see the SFC favorably paving the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs.","Yat Siu, chairman of web3 investor Animoca Brands, mentioned that the SFC is open to broadening digital asset access and pointed to a spot Bitcoin ETF as a relatively uncontroversial option.","Julia Leung, CEO of Hong Kong\u2019s SFC, has also conveyed the regulator\u2019s intention to evaluate spot Bitcoin ETFs and its willingness to consider proposals.","Furthermore, HashKey Group\u2019s COO Livia Wend said early this month that about ten fund firms are in the process of readying virtual asset spot ETFs for launch in Hong Kong.","He noted that seven or eight of them were in advanced stages of preparation as of Jan. 10.","Hong Kong already has several futures-based crypto ETFs. These include Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF, CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, and CSOP Ether Futures ETF.","Despite its openness to digital assets, Hong Kong is known for having strict regulations in this area.","Both Hong Kong\u2019s central bank and securities regulator tightened crypto regulations after a major scandal involving crypto exchange JPEX, allegedly affecting more than 2,000 victims last year.
