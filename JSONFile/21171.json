Others, meanwhile, warn that further price consolidation is the most likely outcome as the market enters the first quarter of 2022."," \u201CWe\u2019ll see [USD] 100k within the first half of the year,\u201D Samson Mow, chief strategy officer at bitcoin development firm Blockstream told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.","Mow added that bitcoin over the short-term will likely continue to behave as a risk asset like stocks, with central bank policy being a driver of price. However, he added that: ","\u201COn a long enough time horizon, [Bitcoin] does its own thing.\u201D","A similar prediction was also shared by Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, who told CNBC on Monday that he believes bitcoin is going to reach USD 100,000 this year, with the most likely time being \u201Cby the middle of 2022.\u201D","Trenchev added that he sees two reasons for the key price level being reached this year: companies are quietly \u201Cbuilding out their treasuries and filling it with bitcoin,\u201D and the \u201Ccheap money [\u2026] is here to stay.\u201D","\u201CEvery time investors and the broader community writes off bitcoin, it outperforms significantly,\u201D Trenchev said, while adding: \u201CI\u2019m quite bullish on bitcoin.\u201D","Meanwhile, in comments shared with Cryptonews.com, Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the digital asset broker GlobalBlock, pointed to a recent all-time high in the Bitcoin network\u2019s hashrate as a sign of strength for the coin\u2019s fundamental value.","\u201CThis indicator shows how Bitcoin is the world\u2019s most secure computing network so new highs complement Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental value,\u201D the analyst said.","However, not everyone is convinced that the bitcoin price will move higher any time soon. According to the popular on-chain analyst and 21st Paradigm co-founder Dylan LeClair, a further consolidation in price is the most likely short-term outcome, given signals from the options market.","LeClair argued that \u201Cconsolidation for a little\u201D has been his base case for bitcoin since at least December, when he had predicted that BTC would consolidate into the first quarter of 2022. He added that he \u201Csold some short dated calls\u201D in recent weeks, indicating that he does not see a bitcoin price rise as likely in the short-term.","","Consolidation for a little has been my base case as well.\n\nSold some short dated calls the last few weeks. https:\/\/t.co\/Zoq7XMYBQi","Lastly, according to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode\u2019s latest The Week Onchain report, the beginning of 2022 has been marked by \u201Ca general lack of activity\u201D across many on-chain metrics.","The report added that coins on the whole have continued to move to \u201Cincreasingly illiquid, and dormant wallets,\u201D which is normally bullish, while some \u201Ccyclical metrics\u201D paint a more bearish picture.","\u201CWith a balance of both bull and bear signals at hand, our expectations into the start of 2022 are likely continued sideways consolidation,\u201D the firm said.","At 11:02 UTC, BTC traded at USD 46,727, down 1% for the past 24 hours and almost 8% for the past 7 days.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Predictions for 2022\n\u2013 Crypto Adoption in 2022: What to Expect?\u2013 2022 Crypto Regulation Trends: Focus on DeFi, Stablecoins, NFTs, and More\n\n\u2013 DeFi Trends in 2022: Growing Interest, Regulation & New Roles for DAOs, DEXes, NFTs, and Gaming\n\u2013 Crypto Security in 2022: Prepare for More DeFi Hacks, Exchange Outages, and Noob Mistakes \n\n\u2013 How Global Economy Might Affect Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Crypto in 2022\u2013 Crypto Exchanges in 2022: More Services, More Compliance, and Competition\n\u2013 Crypto Investment Trends in 2022: Brace for More Institutions and Meme Manias"],"entity":[{"type":"Crypto Regulation Trends","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dylan LeClair","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u2013 Crypto Adoption","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yahoo Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Security","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Antoni Trenchev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Marcus Sotiriou","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Exchange Outages","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Competition\n\u2013 Crypto Investment Trends","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Samson Mow","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stablecoins","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Blockstream","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the first half of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"first quarter of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"21st Paradigm","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"More Compliance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Trenchev","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Blockstream","Forecast","Market"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
