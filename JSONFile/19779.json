Masterminds appear to have promised investors \u201Cguaranteed gains\u201D of up to 2,000%.","Munhwa Ilbo reported that Seoul Metropolitan Police estimate the \u201Cgang\u201D managed to dupe almost 160 victims out of a combined $8 million. Police think the gang may have issued a coin and may be members of the token\u2019s governing foundation. The group then reportedly used sophisticated tactics to manipulate token prices after it was listed by a major domestic exchange.","The capital\u2019s Financial Crimes Investigation Unit stated it had handed all 30 individuals over to prosecutors.","The unit said the operation centered around \u201Ccrypto reading room\u201D channels on the chat app Telegram. The gang, police said, attempted to influence prices on an unnamed, listed coin from September to November 2021.","The gang convinced victims to pool their money so that the gang could make a large coin purchase \u2013 in a bid to drive up prices. But when prices rose, the gang reportedly sold the coins for a large profit \u2013 and did not hand over any of the money to their victims.","Police said that the gang had told victims they could expect to receive \u201Cup to 500%-2,000%\u201D returns on their investments.","Officers said they had frozen a number of crypto exchange wallets and confiscated almost $1 million worth of funds.","The media outlet added that the police have also revealed plans to create a \u201Cconsultative body\u201D with crypto exchanges. Such a body, officers believe, will allow them to start investigations faster in suspected crypto price manipulation cases.","Earlier this month, the CEO of a fake South Korean crypto bank was given a 10-year jail term after a court found him guilty of defrauding investors out of some $181 million."],"entity":[{"type":"\u2019s Financial Crimes Investigation Unit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$ 8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Seoul","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"500%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$181 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Police","Scam","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
