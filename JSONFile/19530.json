Still, it appears not to be affiliated with the original Runes concept by Casey Rodarmor, the man known as the founder of Bitcoin Ordinals.","According to Runecoin rules, all 21,000 RSIC inscriptions were initially manufactured but can no longer be produced due to a mysterious explosion at the factory and distribution centers.","RSIC holders are given three options: mine runes, sell RSICs on the market, or let their RSICs fade.","Runecoin reserved 10% of the RSICs for the game\u2019s designers.","The game has already drawn both excitement and skepticism, with over 33 BTC traded so far.","Among users on social media, however, some have questioned the airdrop\u2019s claims, particularly the claim that it is the \u201Cfirst-ever rune on bitcoin.\u201D","\u201CIt obviously is not the first Rune on Bitcoin and Casey has stated multiple times that no Runes are Runes until the protocol actually drops,\u201D the popular X user Leonidas said, before adding:","\u201CThis is a clear red flag for me so I would advise people to be cautious and recommend the project drops the false claim.\u201D","The way the RSIC airdrop by @rune_coin was done is really neat and I hope airdropping to the Ordinals community becomes a trend but this type of marketing needs to be called out:","\u201CThis is the first ever rune on bitcoin\u201D","It obviously is not the first Rune on Bitcoin and Casey\u2026","\u2014 Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) January 22, 2024","","Similarly, Jake Gallen, a crypto podcast host and product manager at Emblem Vault, also expressed concerns about the lack of transparency and misinformation in marketing the RSICs and the Bitcoin game.","He emphasized the importance of doing thorough research before participating in such projects, saying \u201Cthere is absolutely no guarantee this will be the first-ever rune, nor does this team have any clue as to what the final protocol will look like.\u201D","So let me get this straight\u2026.","A project called RSIC airdropped 80% of a 21,000 supply to Bitcoin Puppets, Bitcoin Frogs, NodeMonkes, and OMB holders. Then kept 20% of the supply.","The promise is \"this is the first ever rune of Bitcoin\".","If you listened to the most recent\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/Eu0PZbRI7D","\u2014 jake.sats (@jakegallen_) January 22, 2024","","Additionally, the identity of the Runecoin team remains unknown, leading to speculation and debates within the community.","In response to the confusion, the Runecoin X account clarified that the runes protocol has not been launched, and no runes have been etched. The account suggested that the airdrop was an experiment and encouraged the community to have fun with it.","The runes protocol has not launched yet and no runes have been etched. We think this is a fun distribution mechanism, which could be used for many things, including runes, and wanted to experiment and have fun with it.
