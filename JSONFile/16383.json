Customers will receive $1.18 for every dollar\u2019s worth of crypto assets they held on the exchange at the time of collapse in November 2022, plus interest.","This result \u2013 rare in the world of bankruptcies, where creditors typically receive pennies on the dollar \u2013 has raised a poignant question for some: Was Sam Bankman-Fried right all along?","Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

This reportedly includes everyone from Silicon Valley VCs, Saudi money men and even SBF\u2019s archrival ex-CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (who reneged on a handshake buyout deal after reviewing the state of FTX\u2019s finances, only speeding up the ongoing run on the exchange).","He was trying to raise this money 1) because SBF and his inner circle had become painfully aware of a shortfall in capital needed to meet all customer withdrawals (a balance reportedly shown to prospective investors showed the exchange only had $900 million in liquid assets) and 2) because (and this is debatable) he believed \u2013 or said he believed \u2013 that there actually was enough capital, it was just illiquid. To wit:","\"FTX is fine. Assets are fine,\u201D Bankman-Fried infamously tweeted out on Nov. 7 after being confronted by FTX co-founder Gary Wang about the exchange\u2019s $8 billion hole as customer withdrawals began to pick up following Zhao\u2019s announcement that he\u2019d sell Binance\u2019s FTT stack.","From the beginning of his ill-fated \u201Cmedia tour\u201D to the end of his trial, SBF routinely characterized FTX\u2019s implosion as due to an accounting error \u2013 in particular a \"confusing internal account\u201D that made it seem to him that FTX was on more solid footing. Plus, as Michael Lewis noted in the hagiography \u201CGoing Infinite,\u201D SBF privately estimated his personal worth at over $100 billion, though that was before the price of FTT, SOL and other \u201CSam Coins\u201D cratered.","It was actually this insistence that he could have rescued FTX had he not declared bankruptcy, and unwillingness to take responsibility for his crime, that led to his lengthy sentence. \u201CIn 30 years, I\u2019ve never seen a performance like that,\u201D Judge Lewis Kaplan said during the sentencing hearing, describing SBF\u2019s evasiveness and remorselessness.","But just because someone believes something doesn\u2019t make it true, no matter how many Substack posts they write or spreadsheets they create. John J. Ray III, current FTX CEO overseeing the bankruptcy, says over the past 17 months the firm was able to recover between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion in assets that weren\u2019t on the exchange at the time it collapsed.","While it will likely take access to documents that aren\u2019t actually publicly available, including FTX\u2019s (abysmal) financial statements before the collapse and for today to conclusively prove this; it\u2019s likely this recovery is due mostly to the rising price of crypto assets. Although JJR\u2019s well-paid legal team likely put in a lot of effort to recover funds from \u201Cdozens of private entities,\u201D it likely doesn\u2019t add up to billions and billions of dollars.","See also: The Downfall of FTX: The Crypto Industry Reacts","Anthropic, for instance, one of SBF\u2019s lucky bets in AI, got the firm a return of $884 million \u2013 a windfall, but likely the biggest non-crypto sale FTX made. FTX also sold off 38 Bahamian properties for around $199 million, and was able to recover nearly $2.6 billion in cash.","In comparison, the estate sold off $1.9 billion worth of deeply discounted SOL recently, and apparently still holds $7.5 billion worth of locked-up tokens. Those tokens were worth less than $500 million at the time of FTX\u2019s collapse. In total, FTX raised about $5 billion by selling tokens, and it expects to raise another $4.4 billion over the next few months.","This to me all seems like FTX wasn\u2019t actually solvent at the time it collapsed and that it could repay the $8 billion in missing customer funds if only SBF had the ability to quickly sell off all of its property, equity investments and crypto (without tanking prices even further). But instead due to the subsequent bull run, FTX became solvent.","Customers are being made whole, not in crypto assets, of which there is still a shortfall (i.e. there is not enough BTC to go around to pay back all customer BTC claims), but in the dollar value of their accounts in November 2022 prices. It\u2019s a lucky break that the market rebounded enough so that the fraction pays for the whole.","But SBF didn\u2019t have the benefit of waiting several months to see if crypto would rise from the ashes. And his argument that FTX only had an illiquidity problem is patently absurd.","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nov. 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$14.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$7.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$16.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CoinDesk, Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Industry Reacts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Saga Happen Without Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.9 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nov. 11, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Lewis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SBF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lewis Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$900 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$199 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$884 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Sam Coins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$500 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$100 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Matt Levine","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gary Wang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"John J.
