We know we are working within the existing legal framework and are not afraid of the consequences.\u2019\u201D","The fact that senior politicians like Aksakov are aware of the situation and are happy to allow firms to continue in this manner is an indication that Moscow may be softening its crypto stance.","The Central Bank has stated that it is happy to allow firms to buy and sell goods in crypto.","But it will only sign off on this if it can receive assurances that the crypto used in these deals will be sold for fiat overseas.","It does not want crypto to enter the Russian economy, and prefers to prioritize the fast-tracked launch of a digital ruble.","Last month, Russian lawmakers claimed that they were making rapid progress on crypto regulation, with two bills reportedly ready for adoption as early as June.","In addition to regulating the crypto sector, MPs also want to legalize authorized crypto mining.","They also hope to outlaw unregistered mining, and will seek to tax industrial miners on their profits."],"entity":[{"type":"Anatoly Aksakov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Moscow","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Markets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State Duma Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Aksakov","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
