(Updated at 16:19 UTC: updates in bold).","Just four days ago, somebody exploited a vulnerability in tokenized margin trading and lending platform bZx, and now the reports are coming out that the same thing has happened once again. And in the light of all of this, total value locked (TLV) in DeFi dropped. After surpassing the USD 1 billion mark earlier this month, on February 15 it reached another all-time high, hitting USD 1.22 billion. It gradually fell to USD 1.149 billion earlier today and then, in a few hours, it crashed 12%, to USD 1 billion (10:00 UTC).","As reported, bZx was already exploited a few days ago. The platform paused borrowing and trading, deployed an upgrade, but also came out with an official report on February 17, which states that a total of ETH 1,193 (USD 320,000) has been taken.","However, on February 18, bZx tweeted that that the pause button has been hit yet again, \u201Cin light of suspicious transactions using flash loans and trading on Synthetix.\u201D Details of another transaction, made less than six hours ago, are shared through the community, according to which ETH 2,388 (USD 640,000) is lost. This caused an uproar in the Cryptoverse, drawing criticism and concern.","\u201CAt first blush, this isn\u2019t a good look for DeFi. But I\u2019m of the opinion these sort of attacks are healthy for the emerging ecosystem, and it might be better to allow \u2013 or even encourage \u2013 \u201Carbitrage games\u201D like the ones on bZx in order to make the systems more resilient before they get bigger and exploits become more damaging,\u201D Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto researcher Messari, said in his newsletter today.","Another result of the first attack, as the report says, is an undercollateralized loan on the platform, which is not currently a loss, but has the potential of becoming one. The debt can be serviced with the current collateral for the next 202 years, at which point, there\u2019ll be a ETH 4,698 loss, which remains from the attackers\u2019 loan, to be socialized across the lending pool. \u201CIf we used the administrator key to liquidate the wBTC into ETH,\u201D says bZx, \u201Cwe could eliminate the impact of market volatility and guarantee that the debt would settle on this date.\u201D Prior to this second attack, the options presented were:","bZx in their report and others in their analyses describe, not an oracle attack, but \u201Ca clever arbitrage execution,\u201D as a blockchain security company PeckShield defined it, which could be separated in five distinct steps: Flashloan Borrow, Hoard, Margin Pump, Dump, Flashloan Repay.","Korantin Auguste, a former Google software engineer, also describes a complex series of steps, which we could say is unlikely done by somebody who wasn\u2019t well-acquainted with the mechanism and its vulnerabilities. \u201CThe attacker exploited a bug in bZx that caused it to trade a huge amount on Uniswap [a protocol for automated token exchange on Ethereum], at a 3x inflated price,\u201D says Auguste, adding \u201CBecause the Uniswap supply is all distorted, they are able to sell these 112 WBTC for 6871 ETH.\u201D","Richard Burton, DeFi product designer, who formerly worked for Ethereum and Balanced.io, argues that \u201Cpeople are borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars for a few seconds to smash the [bZx] protocol to bits,\u201D and adds: \u201CThe open-source financial system is absolutely savage. Everything is vulnerable.\u201D","The centralized vs decentralized debate is still ongoing, with those arguing that a pause button, off-switch, or an admin key shouldn\u2019t exist in DeFi in one camp, and those stating that the space is still in its toddler days in the other.","Whether the second attack was done by the same person(s) can\u2019t be said, as copy-cats are likely to follow an exploit once the method goes public.","Meanwhile, people have been reporting other transaction issues, primarily many alleged filing transactions, for which bZx stated are unrelated to these events.\n___\nLearn more: DeFi Challenge: Organic User Adoption"],"entity":[{"type":"February 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 17","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD 1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Richard Burton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"hundreds of thousands of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD 142 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"6871","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ryan Selkis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hoard","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"earlier this month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"earlier today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1 billion mark","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Korantin Auguste","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.149 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Cryptoverse","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Messari","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1.22 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Flashloan Borrow","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Auguste","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"four days ago","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["DeFi","Hack","Security"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
