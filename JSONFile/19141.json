And judging from some members of the community, the protocol could become the \u201CUniswap moment\u201D of NFTs.","OpenSea said that the first iteration of the new protocol, dubbed Seaport, has already been created by OpenSea itself, but stressed that it is open for anyone to build on. The protocol reportedly allows for a number of new features, including new ways of paying for NFTs, criteria for transactions, and new techniques for eliminating redundant transfers in order to reduce gas fees.","Additionally, OpenSea also said the protocol will allow for \u201Ctipping,\u201D which it said can be used by developers of other interfaces to charge their own platform fees.","The key aspects of the new protocol are that it is not controlled by OpenSea and that it will become a free and open resource that can be used by anyone.","\u201CThe core smart contract is open source and inherently decentralized, with no contract owner, upgradeability, or other special privileges,\u201D the announcement from Open Sea said.","OpenSea has in the past been criticized by users for operating in a centralized way, with Iranian users complaining in March this year that they had been banned from the platform without any advance notice. OpenSea at the time defended itself, saying that as a US-based company it must comply with US sanctions regulations.","Now, however, members of the NFT community appear to be happy, with one popular member, atareh.eth, saying that he believes this could be NFTs\u2019 \u201CUniswap moment,\u201D referring to how the decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI) kickstarted the \u2018decentralized finance (DeFi) summer\u2019 of 2020.","\u201CPerhaps there\u2019s another NFT summer on the horizon soon enough\u2026,\u201D the user wrote.","The same user also went into more depth on how the new protocol will function, explaining that it will open up for more advanced functions like trading one NFT for another and setting specific criteria for who can take the other side of the trade.","4) Trade for specific NFTs: When trading NFTs, you can also set specific \u201Ccriteria\u201D that the NFT must have.\n\nSo, want to trade your rank 2 Azuki only for a gold BAYC? you can specify that\n\nOnly wallets with a gold ape can trade for your NFT pic.twitter.com\/6qRW3AFsU7","OpenSea was founded in 2017 and built out during the 2018 crypto bear market. It has long been the dominant marketplace for NFTs, although it has increasingly been challenged by LooksRare as well as marketplaces based on blockchains other than Ethereum (ETH).","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 OpenSea Now Supports Solana NFTs in Beta\n\u2013 OpenSea Boosts Valuation 9X as This NFT Giant Sets Four Strategic Goals\n\n\u2013 OpenSea\u2019s Trading Volume Remains in a Downtrend Amid Recent Attacks\n\u2013 Removing LooksRare\u2019s USD 8.3B in Wash-Trades, OpenSea is Still the Dominant NFT Marketplace\n\n\u2013 Decentralization Debate Heats Up Again as MetaMask, OpenSea Block Users\n\u2013 Another Expensive NFT Gets Mistakenly Sold at Large Discount \u2013 How Does That Happen?"],"entity":[{"type":"NFT Marketplace\n\n\u2013 Decentralization Debate Heats","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"OpenSea Block Users\n\u2013 Another Expensive NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"OpenSea","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"OpenSea\u2019s Trading Volume Remains","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wash","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Decentralization","Fees","NFT","Non-fungible tokens","Opensea"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
