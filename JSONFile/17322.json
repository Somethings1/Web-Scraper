Bentson Jr. said in a February statement. \u201CBecause of its impact on bank capital and liquidity ratios, SAB 121 has disincentivized banks from providing custodial services for digital assets.\u201D","\u201CGiven that these institutions have successfully offered custodial services to the traditional financial system for decades, it only makes sense for banks and other financial entities to continue this service for digital assets,\u201D Flood said.","The SEC, chaired by Gary Gensler, has long been criticized for its aggressive regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies. Under his leadership, the agency has sued several digital asset firms.","Meanwhile, Senator Cynthia Lummis is leading a joint senate resolution to Flood\u2019s proposal that has yet to be voted on.","However, it remains to be seen whether each resolution will pass its respective chambers."],"entity":[{"type":"Tom Emmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. House of Representatives","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Representatives Wiley Nickel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kenneth E.
