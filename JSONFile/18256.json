This activity is part of a wider trend that has seen the global crypto market cap increase to $2.36 trillion, up over 7% over the last day.","The uptick is influenced by the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision, as indicated by Chair Jerome Powell, to halt further interest rate increases, a policy move that often favors investments like Bitcoin by enhancing their appeal.","The surge is also supported by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and the successful launch of similar products in Hong Kong, highlighting a renewed and growing confidence among investors.","The combination of these factors indicates a possible increase in the price of Bitcoin.","Bitcoin ETFs have recently witnessed a notable surge in inflows, totaling $378 million on May 3, marking a recovery after a week of outflows.","This influx includes a significant $63 million investment in Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF (GBTC), its first since January. This is notable considering Grayscale\u2019s previous $17.5 billion loss attributed to higher fees compared to competitors.","ðŸŸ© FINAL 5\/3 U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows of +$378 million âœ…","ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Bitcoin ETFs bought 6,123 #Bitcoin today (~14 days supply) pic.twitter.com\/hxdSY6sbVQ","\u2014 HODL15Capital ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@HODL15Capital) May 4, 2024","","Other prominent Bitcoin ETFs, like Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and Franklin Templeton\u2019s EZBC, also reported significant inflows.","These inflows reflect a renewed confidence in the crypto market, potentially signalling a broader recovery and rising demand for Bitcoin.","Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs have made a remarkable entrance, attracting $258 million in just three days of trading. This surge in capital inflows highlights a growing investor appetite for Bitcoin and underscores the strength of Hong Kong\u2019s crypto market, especially compared to the global landscape.","While the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced $860 million in outflows, Hong Kong\u2019s market saw nearly $300 million in inflows, demonstrating its robustness during global market volatility.","This financial dynamism coincided with a 5.75% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $63,050.11, showcasing the market\u2019s resilience.","The significant interest in Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs likely played a pivotal role in the recent BTC price uptick, reinforcing positive market sentiment amid broader economic uncertainty.","","The technical outlook suggests a bullish Bitcoin price prediction, as BTC is holding around a pivotal price point of $61,651. Ascending beyond this mark, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $64,565, with further resistance anticipated at $67,085 and $70,000.","Conversely, if Bitcoin\u2019s price falls, it encounters immediate support at $59,165, with subsequent levels at $56,675 and $54,335 poised to offer further stability.","Recent trends on the 4-hour chart show Bitcoin surpassing the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,575, transitioning it from a resistance to a support level.","As discussed in the morning story on Bitcoin price prediction, the \u2018three white soldiers\u2019 candlestick pattern suggests strong bullish momentum. Nonetheless, a resistance near $63,200 could temper the ascent, demanding a breakthrough for further gains.","Should Bitcoin overcome this barrier, it is likely to challenge the next resistance at $64,564 promptly.","Overcoming this could thrust Bitcoin towards $67,084 and potentially reach as high as $70,000, especially if it surpasses a distinct double-top pattern near $67,000.","Supporting this bullish scenario is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63, signaling robust buying interest.","Technical Indicators:","With these dynamics, Bitcoin\u2019s prospects appear favourable above the $61,650 pivot. Remaining above this level could lead Bitcoin to test upper resistances. However, slipping below could trigger significant sell-offs, targeting lower support levels as the market reassesses its direction.","","","","99Bitcoins, a leader in digital education, is transforming the way users learn about cryptocurrency through its \u2018learn-to-earn\u2019 platform. Participants can enhance their knowledge while earning $99BTC tokens, effectively growing both their expertise and their investment portfolios.","The current presale of $99BTC tokens is catching the attention of savvy investors, offering an enticing entry price for early participants.","This presale presents a rare chance for early investors to secure $99BTC tokens at a competitive price of $0.00103 each.
