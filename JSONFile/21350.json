Nickel sent a letter to Gensler on Wednesday urging him to rescind the controversial staff accounting bulletin amidst the Senate vote to nullify it.","Nickel wrote, \u201CI strongly encourage you to withdraw SAB121 to protect investors, bolster American competitiveness, and respect Congress\u2019s role in the administrative rulemaking process.\u201D","He emphasized that withdrawing SAB121 before the Senate vote would be a positive step towards balancing crypto regulation and allowing for digital asset custodial banking.","The SEC\u2019s guidance on digital asset accounting has long been criticized for its stringent capital requirements on banks looking to enter crypto. Participating financial institutions are required to list clients\u2019 liabilities alongside custodied digital assets on their balance sheets.","Today, I sent a letter to @SECGov Chair Gary Gensler calling on the agency to withdraw its Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. Unfortunately, the SEC is turning #crypto into a political football & forcing @POTUS to unnecessarily choose sides on an issue that matters to many Americans. pic.twitter.com\/F3L8fZSNR0","\u2014 Rep. Wiley Nickel (@RepWileyNickel) May 15, 2024","","In addition to scrutiny regarding the bulletin\u2019s regulatory stance, U.S. lawmakers have cast doubt over SAB121\u2019s approval process. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the SEC failed to report the rule change under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).","Last week, the House passed H.J. Res 109, a bill Nickel and Representative Mike Flood (R-NE) introduced to invalidate SAB121. Following the House vote, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has led the Senate push to invalidate the controversial accounting bulletin.","\u201CSAB 121 hinders well-regulated banks from safeguarding digital assets, making the industry less safe for consumers,\u201D Nickel said in a statement last week. \u201CGary Gensler and the SEC deliberately sidestepped the customary regulatory process, amounting to an obvious overreach of the agency\u2019s authority.\u201D","However, shortly after the House passed Flood and Nickel\u2019s bill, President Joe Biden said he would veto attempts to make the bill a law because it was \u201Cissued in response to demonstrated technological, legal, and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers.\u201D","\u201CLimiting the SEC\u2019s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty,\u201D a May 8 letter from the White House states.","Should the Senate pass Lummis\u2019 companion legislation, Nickel\u2019s letter to Gensler may be a last-minute push to get Gensler to rescind SAB121 before it would reach Biden\u2019s desk."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 15, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"White House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wiley Nickel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Government Accountability Office (GAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"H.J.
