Still, investors are shifting funds to an exciting new virtual reality ICO called 5thScape (5SCAPE) as they see potential 1,000% returns.","Last trading at $0.000027, Shiba Inu has bounced an impressive 47% from earlier monthly lows.","If the second largest meme coin by market cap can break above its 21DMA, buy pressure could further increase as it could signify that SHIB has snapped its recent downtrend. That could ignite speculation of an imminent retest of 2024 highs above $0.000045.","While Shiba Inu\u2019s near-term outlook is strong, the meme coin\u2019s bloated market cap is an issue to some investors.","Shiba Inu\u2019s market cap is around $16 billion, as per CoinMarketCap, limiting¬†the potential gains that SHIB can deliver this bull market.","Yes, perhaps SHIB could still go 3-5x from here, but, many crypto investors are looking for much bigger gains.","It\u2019s no surprise then that Shiba Inu investors have been shifting to a new virtual reality ICO 5thScape.","The first-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR\/AR project has already raised over $5.5 million.
