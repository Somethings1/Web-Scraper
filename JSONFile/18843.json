Miners worldwide run powerful computers to validate transactions and create new tokens. ","Seeking the cheapest sources of power, miners often face challenges due to fluctuating cryptocurrency prices. ","However, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value has renewed interest in mining operations, making it more profitable to continue supporting the network.","Analysts predict a shift in the geography of crypto mining following the recent halving event, as profit margins become slimmer. ","Countries with lower energy costs, such as those in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, are attracting crypto miners. ","This presents an opportunity for renewable energy developers in these regions to utilize their excess power and support the expanding Bitcoin network.","Gridless, founded by Hersman and his co-founders Philip Walton and Janet Maingi, aims to bridge the gap between power generation and capacity in Africa. ","With approximately 600 million people lacking access to electricity, the company\u2019s Bitcoin mining operations serve a dual purpose. ","They harness renewable energy sources that would otherwise go to waste and provide electricity to homes and businesses in underserved communities.","The volcanic region where Gridless operates, known as Hell\u2019s Gate, has a rich history and is home to diverse wildlife. ","By leveraging the energy potential of volcanoes, geothermal power stations have been established in the area. ","This approach is not unique to Kenya; other countries like Iceland and El Salvador have also harnessed geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining.","Bitcoin mining has faced criticism due to its energy consumption. However, when coupled with renewable energy sources, it can help unlock trapped renewable power and incentivize increased production.","Bitcoin miners act as energy buyers, utilizing excess power from renewable sources and providing financial incentives for further development.","Gridless has not only powered thousands of households but also facilitated containerized cold storage for local farmers, charging stations for electric motorcycles, and public WiFi points. ","Through its mining operations, the company is making renewable energy economically viable in Africa while contributing to the secure functioning of the Bitcoin network.","\u201CIt\u2019s not really sexy,\u201D Hersman said. ","\u201CIt\u2019s a mining container made from a shipping container. It\u2019s got a bunch of dumb machines sitting in it running the same equation over and over again, but it\u2019s actually what secures the network.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"El Salvador","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kenya","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hell\u2019s Gate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Philip Walton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Latin America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Janet Maingi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Malawi","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hell\u2019s Gate National Park","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Iceland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hersman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zambia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Erik Hersman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Mining","Jack Dorsey"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
