This article should set you on the right path.","Here are our picks for the very best cryptocurrencies to watch this year, including meme coins, move-to-earn titans, top smart contract platforms, and the future of decentralized finance.","In this article, we hope to simplify your decision-making process by highlighting the cryptocurrencies we think are worth paying close attention to in 2024.\n","We have picked Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) as the top cryptocurrency to watch in 2024. $DOGEVERSE is a meme coin that offers real utility and unique network attributes. ","For instance, Dogeverse is the first-ever Doge-themed meme cryptocurrency, supporting multi-chain compatibility. While Dogeverse is built on the Ethereum blockchain, it will use Portal Bridge and Wormhole technology to bridge across five other blockchain platforms. ","","These include Binance, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and the Base blockchain. Thus, token holders can seamlessly navigate across the best networks, offering cost optimization, high throughput, and fast transaction speeds. ","Furthermore, $DOGEVERSE can also be held to offer passive income to token holders. At the time of writing, you can stake $DOGEVERSE and earn a 107% annual yield. From a 200 billion token supply, 20 billion tokens will be offered through staking rewards. ","Another 30 billion tokens are being distributed for the presale. At the time of writing, $DOGEVERSE is priced at $0.000301 per token. In only a few weeks, the presale has raised more than $10 million. ","Due to these reasons, Dogeverse is one of the best meme coins to watch in 2024. To learn more, read the Dogeverse whitepaper and join the Telegram channel. \n","Visit Dogeverse","The next cryptocurrency to watch in 2024 is $SEAL, the native token of Sealana. This is a new meme coin, built on the Solana blockchain. The illustration of Sealana features a lazy and obese American Redneck seal. This is inspired by the \u2018World of Warcraft Guy\u2019 \u2013 a popular character from the South Park television series. ","","The seal decides to start trading cryptos to move out of his mom\u2019s basement. The project invites bold and risk-taking investors to join the $SEAL presale. In the last few weeks, the Solana meme coin hype has reached an all-time high, as new coins such as Solama and Popcat have been offering huge returns. ","To take part in the ongoing presale, interested investors can send SOL tokens to the following wallet address \u2013","DJ15ZYXqUNMYJ3hL7z4ciSaSFAw5cbos3YjGpdvwmF6c. ","Once the tokens are transferred, $SEAL tokens will be sent to your crypto wallets. At the time of writing, an investment of 1 SOL will get you 6,900 $SEAL tokens. Nearly $150K has been raised since the start of the presale. To stay tuned for further project updates, join the Sealana Telegram channel and follow Sealana on X (Formerly Twitter). ","Visit Sealana","Mega Dice Casino has recently launched the Mega Dice Token ($DICE) to fuel its casino and sports betting ecosystem. $DICE will offer token holders several benefits across the 4,500 games and 50+ sports betting markets offered by Mega Dice. ","Long-term investors can stake $DICE on the staking mechanism to earn a high annual yield. Staked token holders will be rewarded with daily rewards on the casino games. $DICE can be leveraged to access limited-edition NFTs, which lead to exclusive benefits on the casino. ","","Furthermore, token holders can join Mega Dice Token\u2019s affiliate program, where they are entitled to a 25% revenue share. Currently, Mega Dice Token is priced at $0.069 during the first presale stage. From a 420 million token supply, 147 million tokens are being allocated for the presale. ","Early presale investors will receive free tokens as well. Mega Dice Token is also running an airdrop campaign \u2013 which will distribute $2.25 million worth of tokens to $DICE holders. Eventually, Mega Dice Token will use a portion of its profits to buy back and burn tokens, helping reduce the supply. ","Learn more about this cryptocurrency by going through the Mega Dice Token whitepaper and joining the Telegram channel. ","Visit Mega Dice Token Presale","The next top cryptocurrency to watch in 2024 is $5SCAPE, the native token of 5th Scape. This innovative platform allows players to experience virtual and augmented reality ecosystems. ","$5SCAPE, the native token, can be used to earn several discounts and features on 5th Scape. Token holders are offered exclusive and lifetime access to certain games on 5th Scape. ","","You can take part in VR games such as Cage Conquest, an MMA game where players engage in strategic training sessions and battle in live tournaments. Players could also engage in Soccer and Cricket simulations with 5th Scape. ","$5SCAPE holders can get VR gaming headsets and chairs at discounted prices. Due to the multiple use cases offered, $5SCAPE is off to a great start through its presale campaign. From a total supply of 5.21 billion, over 4 billion tokens are being distributed through the presale.","At press time, $5SCAPE is priced at $0.00285 per token. So far, the presale has raised almost $4 million. 5th Scape aims to raise $15 million by the end of the presale. With the token set to list on exchanges post the presale, 5th Scape could be a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2024. ","For more information, read the 5th Scape whitepaper and join the Telegram channel. ","Visit 5th Scape","Sponge V2 is a hot new upgrade of the Sponge meme coin, which gained significant attention in 2023 with a remarkable 100x growth. Transitioning from the original SPONGE, this new version integrates improved utility features, making it one of the best cryptos to watch in 2024.","Central to Sponge V2\u2019s appeal is the Stake-to-Bridge model. This approach enables the transition from Sponge V1 to V2, where users stake V1 tokens to acquire V2 tokens, effectively locking in the original tokens. This strategy highlights a commitment to long-term value and community investment in the project.","A major addition to the Sponge V2 ecosystem is the introduction of a P2E gaming platform, Sponge Racer. This feature allows users to interact with the token, using their V2 tokens within the gaming environment to earn additional rewards.","With an existing base of over 30,000 community members, SPONGEV2 is set to expand its reach and visibility. The project is targeting listings on major exchanges such as Binance and OKX, aiming to replicate and surpass the success of its predecessor.","The community plays a key role in SPONGEV2\u2019s growth. Potential investors can interact with the community on platforms like X (Twitter) and Telegram for regular updates, insights into the Stake-to-Bridge model, P2E gaming details, and information about upcoming exchange listings."," ","Smog is a trending new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by successful precursors like Myro, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. Its goofy dragon mascot, and its claim to offer the \u201CGreatest SOL Airdrop of All Time\u201D have already drawn a lot of investor attention, as has its decision to skip the presale round completely and launch on the Jupiter DEX.","This new meme crypto rewards community engagement across various platforms and on-chain activities, including buying, holding, and staking, creating a fair distribution of tokens to promote active participation. There are over 23,000 SMOG holders as of this writing.","","You can swap SOL, USDT, BONK or other Solana tokens to purchase SMOG tokens, and hold them to qualify for the airdrop. The team behind Smog will detect this and start tracking your airdrop points.","Smog integrates with Zealy.io to manage its airdrops. The more tasks you complete, the more points you\u2019ll earn. There have been over 270,000 tasks completed on Zealy by more than 8,500 members, so far. These points will be updated a few weeks after launch."," ","eTukTuk (TUK) is involved in more of a niche field as compared to many environmental initiatives. It\u2019s specifically focused on the distribution of eco-friendly tuk-tuk vehicles in less developed regions. The tuk-tuk is a common means of transport in specific Asian countries but is considerably more environmentally damaging in comparison to cars. The electric vehicles can be charged at eco-friendly charging stations, maintained by territory partners. ","eTukTuk looks for a solution that not only helps the environment but also assists in terms of social and economic inclusion. The transport industry is important in many poorer regions and drivers can find it difficult to make a living. The new electric vehicles will cut down on fuel costs considerably and the native token can be used by drivers to earn staking rewards and to make in-app purchases.","","Thus far, the project has raised over a million USDT. It offers a substantial 40% discount if purchased at the presale stage. TUK is a BEP20 token with a total supply of 2 billion. The current price is $0.027. The token has been audited by Certik, a well-recognized third party.","For more information about a project that aims for financial inclusion, global equality, and a reduction in carbon emission, read the eTukTuk whitepaper. You can also learn more about the project by following it on Twitter and Telegram."," ","Sei is one of the fastest layer 1 blockchains that supports various environments including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The goal is to have Web2 speed and performance with the decentralization and ownership of Web3. To allow everyone to contribute and build on the blockchain, Sei has a fully open source code.","Backed by some of the largest players in the crypto industry, including Circle, Delphi Digital and Coinbase, Sei has the potential break into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap in 2024.","","Sei already has a strong community and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications, but more importantly the blockchain itself is growing at a fast pace. In the first half of 2024, due to developer and user demand, Sei Labs is building an upgrade to the blockchain as the first parallelized EVM blockchain.","Widely regarded as one of the most advanced smart contract platforms, Solana has gathered a huge amount of momentum and captured the imagination of the crypto community since it launched in 2019.","The platform can now be considered a flourishing ecosystem of dApps \u2014 many of which are unique to the Solana platform. ","","Although it\u2019s more than five years in the making, Solana can still be considered a new cryptocurrency to watch since it\u2019s still in its beta release. As an ultra-scalable, energy-efficient, high-speed, and developer-friendly smart contract platform, some believe that Solana will be used to host the next generation of mass-market dApps. ","The SOL coin has recovered in the past months and is now trading above $100, making it the top five cryptocurrency by market cap.","Pyth is an oracle similar to Chainlink (LINK) that provides real-time market data for crypto, stocks, forex and commodities to over 50 blockchains. This makes Pyth an essential part of the crypto space and the demand for the token could increase in the future.","The project\u2019s codebase is built on Solana, which allows for sub-second speeds, and it uses the Wormhole for multi-chain messaging. The fee for using the protocol will be determined by voting in the Pyth DAO.","","The PYTH token is the governance token, meaning you get voting rights in the Pyth DAO. There is no APY for staking the token, but several projects have announced they will aridrop their project tokens to Pyth stakers. If the airdrop trend continues, we could see even higher demand for the token, making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to watch in 2024.","Jupiter is the largest decentralized finance application on Solana and the largest aggregator. On the app, you can exchange any Solana-based token you want, you can set DCA orders and limit orders and you can trade perpetual futures if you want to use leverage. Moreover, you can onramp from fiat to Solana via Mercuryo or you can move assets from other chains like Ethereum to Solana.","The JUP token is the governance token that launched in January 2024. However, there\u2019s no staking option yet or voting for the Jupiter DAO governance. This is a planned feature for release in 2024. Once it comes out, JUP could be in high demand, given the volume traded on Jupiter is frequently over $500 million within a 24-hour period.","","Since Jupiter built its own token launch platform where the JUP token launched, users on Solana speculate that holding JUP will make them eligible for airdrops from tokens that launch on the Jupiter launchpad. If this turns out to be true, JUP will definitely be one of the best coins to watch in 2024.","Bonk is the third largest meme coin by market cap, right behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, and it\u2019s the most popular meme coin on Solana. It started as a community airdrop after the FTX exchange collapsed when a lot of investors lost faith in Solana. Now it boasts over $750 million in market cap and over 600,000 holders.","Unlike most meme coins that offer nothing of value aside from price speculation, the team behind Bonk has built a Telegram trading bot, a multi-chain wormhole, Bonkswap, an NFT collection and more. ","","The reason why this is one of the top cryptos to watch in 2024 is that it\u2019s listed on virtually every major exchange, it has a huge following and it is 15x undervalued in terms of market cap than Dogecoin as of this writing and 115x from Dogecoin all-time highs. If the bull market takes off this year, Bonk could be one of the tokens to benefit.","Injective is a layer 1 blockchain designed for building financial decentralized applications. The blockchain uses the Cosmos\u2019s smart contract platform for building decentralized apps. This makes it easy to grow the ecosystem as Cosmos developers can easily build DeFi apps on the Injective blockchain as well. Another way to incentives growth is to reward developers with INJ coins.","INJ is the native coin of this blockchain, which you can stake to secure the network, vote in the Injective DAO or pay transaction fees.","","This is a deflationary coin as 60% of the fees generated from applications are burned. This should increase token demand and token price as the blockchain grows in 2024.","Render Network is a provider of decentralized GPU solutions connecting those that have idle GPUs and those that need compute power to render their projects. In this case, the former earn RNDR tokens for providing compute power, while the latter pay in RNDR tokens for the service.","The application of this is for virtual assets (product designs, architecture, video and video games) and artificial intelligence. With the rise of text-to-video AI solutions, GPU power and rendering is likely to have increase in demand. And that\u2019s why the RNDR token is one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2024.","","RNDR is now the second largest AI-themed cryptocurrency based on market cap, which stands at over $2.7 billion as of this writing. There is more room to grow if the AI hype takes over the markets once again.","Cryptocurrencies are unusual among speculative assets in that they can vary considerably in their promise and potential and can rise or collapse incredibly quickly.","While some cryptocurrencies are clear game-changers and almost certainly have a bright future ahead of them, others are more subtle or nuanced in their design, which can make their potential difficult to spot at first glance.","In our process of finding the most promising cryptos to watch in 2024, we try to separate the reality from the hype to see which potential crypto coins to watch have what it takes to achieve long-term success.","Practically, this means taking the crypto market as a whole, identifying the narratives that will likely drive the future of crypto adoption, and using this to separate out a pool of candidates.","It is easy to find new coins with the likes of CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, CoinList and others all carrying long lists of new coins, while social media sites such as Reddit and Twitter are also great tools to find new projects.","However, once a coin grabs your attention, from there you must complete further research and do your due diligence. Easily spotted good points are a doxxed (public) team, strong social media buzz and well thought out and thorough roadmap and whitepaper.","Immediate red flags are an anonymous team and incomplete or badly presented websites and documents, while one must also be wary of social media bots and spam. You then must further refine your search to extract only the most robust options which we consider the top cryptos to watch this year.","Some of the filters we use when identifying new cryptocurrencies to watch include:","The top crypto to watch this week all have one thing in common \u2014 they\u2019ve got serious long-term potential.","Put simply, this means they\u2019ve both got staying power and the capacity to grow significantly over the long term. As has been seen time and time again, the most promising new cryptos to watch can have the potential to 10x or even 100x their value in just a few years \u2014 making them incredibly lucrative.","Some of the simplest ways to gauge the long-term potential of an asset are to examine the strength and background of its founding team, identify its value-adding backers and partners, estimate how demand for its services will change over time, and check whether it has any major competitors.","If a potential cryptocurrency to watch has no major competitors, then it may have the first-mover advantage, or there simply isn\u2019t demand for the services it provides \u2014 both cases should be considered before investing.","Oftentimes, new cryptos to watch manage to gather an incredibly strong community because of their innovation and impressive fundamentals. And there is arguably no better sign of strength than an engaged and enthusiastic community. ","We typically gauge community interest by examining the sentiment surrounding a project on its social media and public discussion boards \u2014 such as Reddit, Telegram, and Discord. This, combined with the simple number of genuine community members can be a strong indicator of potential.","Every now and then, a pioneering project comes along that pushes the boundaries of what can be done with blockchain technology.","When we research cryptocurrencies to watch, we look for projects with disruptive potential \u2014 whether that be displacing outdated projects, the capability to reach and onboard new user demographics, or a level of creativity to inspire a generation.","As you might have noticed, several of our picks today are trendsetters in their own right and could form the heart of an entirely new ecosystem of products. ","The cryptocurrency industry is vast and for every use case, there is usually a handful of different platforms competing for dominance.","The top cryptos to watch tend to have a strong advantage over their competition \u2014 one that cannot be easily matched. This can include an impressive technical team, vibrant community, excellent marketing, or an experienced founding team.","When we list promising cryptos to watch in 2024, we take into account the competition and try to pick the project most likely to lead the cryptocurrency market long term.","A token\u2019s utility is a strong indicator of its likely performance in the crypto market. Tokens that have little to no utility are not likely to appreciate in value.","That said, the best cryptocurrency to watch in 2024 will almost certainly have a highly demanded use case and\/or specific economic drivers that act to increase its value. ","The newest crypto to watch in 2024 and beyond are those that have clear, specific mechanisms in place to drive value to holders and incentivize new buyers.","In this guide, we identified popular cryptos to watch. Each has the fundamentals necessary to achieve substantial success over the long term and potentially reach a much greater value.","Unlike most traditional markets, cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile and can generate substantial returns or losses over very short periods. Because of this, it\u2019s important to take the time to filter the most promising projects and gauge an attractive entry price for each. This will help you make volatility work in your favor.","Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is one of the top cryptos to watch right now. It is a multi-chain meme coin, offering high staking yield. ","Visit Dogeverse","Though there is no single best crypto \u2013 many prominent candidates have emerged in recent weeks, boasting the right mix of fundamentals and potential. This includes Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), which offers high staking yield.","Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain by far the most watched cryptocurrencies. They both have an impressive pedigree and have demonstrated nothing short of meteoric growth since their inception. These remain popular cryptos to watch in 2024 due to their sheer long-term potential. But a whole new generation of assets has also appeared in recent months. This includes the likes of Dogeverse, Mega Dice Token, and 5th Scape. "],"entity":[{"type":"Bonkswap","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sealana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.25 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mega Dice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bonk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dice Casino","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$DICE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"200 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"MMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"South Park","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$0.00285","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Delphi Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pyth DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"107%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"\u201CGreatest SOL Airdrop of All Time\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jupiter DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Telegram","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$5SCAPE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.069","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.000301","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$0.027","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$SEAL","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mega Dice Token Presale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dogeverse","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jupiter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Portal Bridge","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cage Conquest","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jupiter DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$750 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mega Dice Token","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$DOGEVERSE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dogecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"GPU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$150K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$500 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"5.21 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"first half of 2024","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Solana","TAMADOGE"],"authors":["Daniel Phillips"]}
