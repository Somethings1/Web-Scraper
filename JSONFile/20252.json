They could then utilize the acquired IBEUR to pay down some of their outstanding borrows with Iron Bank, Funk said.","The depeg incident was triggered by a single trader withdrawing nearly $900,000 in USDC liquidity from the Curve pool that primarily supports trading in IBEUR.","The imbalance resulted from the withdrawal, as the pool was slightly weighted toward IBEUR, lacking sufficient USDC liquidity to maintain proper trading alignment.","According to CoinDesk, Funk mentioned in the Keep3r chat that, regarding the IBEUR\/USDC pool, they would have to wait and let the curve pool readjust.","Additionally, Funk suggested that it would be helpful if the Iron Bank team halted their credit borrowing contract, which currently has 2.5 million IBEUR borrowed and appears to be involved in farming single-sided activities on the pools.Top of Form"],"entity":[{"type":"Funk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.70","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$900,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.82","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Iron Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank Euro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$0.97","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$0.39","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Stablecoin"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
