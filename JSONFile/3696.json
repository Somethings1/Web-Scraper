Justice Gendall sided with the latter, as he classified crypto as property and not as simple debt.","The ruling appears to be a precedent-setting court decision. \u201CThis is the first occasion on which issues of this type concerning cryptocurrency have been before the courts in New Zealand,\u201D according to the judgment.","As a result of this ruling, Cryptopia liquidators, overseen by Grant Thornton New Zealand, now know how they can distribute user funds. The liquidators have estimated Cryptopia currently holds cryptocurrency worth about NZ$ 170 million (~US$101 million), per the judgment.","Cryptopia owes over 800,000 users, who are holding a positive coin balance on the platform. The exchange\u2019s 37 creditors and 90 shareholders have also been seeking reimbursements.","It remains to be seen how and when the funds get distributed. The Block has reached out to both Cryptopia and Grant Thornton New Zealand for comments and will update this story should we hear back."],"hashtag":[]}
