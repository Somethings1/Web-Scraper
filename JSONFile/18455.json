Of these, EIP-4844, commonly called proto-danksharding, is attracting significant attention.","Ethereum investors are eagerly awaiting to see the changes and benefits this upgrade will bring to the network.","EIP-4844 is set to be a game changer for Ethereum\u2019s efficiency, particularly for Layer-2 scaling solutions like rollups. Currently, these rollups enhance transaction speed and reduce costs by temporarily holding a copy of Ethereum\u2019s ledger and history.","This setup helps in verifying the accuracy of transactions. But it relies on using \u201Ccalldata\u201D for data storage, which is quite expensive \u2013 costing about $1000 per megabyte. This high cost can be a major hurdle, especially when there\u2019s a surge in demand.","EIP-4844 aims to resolve this issue by introducing a new concept called \u201Cblob\u201D transactions. These are designed as a temporary data storage solution specifically tailored for Ethereum\u2019s rollup needs. Unlike the current approach, blobs can store large amounts of data more efficiently and cost-effectively.","By providing a more cost-effective way of storing large amounts of data, this upgrade will make it cheaper and more efficient to operate on Ethereum.","Blobs are also expected to expand the data submission capacity for Layer-2 solutions when interacting with the Ethereum mainnet. This enhancement has the potential to dramatically increase the number of transactions the network can handle per second.","Overall, users can expect a more scalable, efficient, and cost-effective Ethereum network following this upgrade.","It\u2019s anticipated that there will be a surge in the use of Ethereum for various applications after the Duncan upgrade. So, it is poised to positively shift investor sentiment towards Ether. This demand pressure, combined with the improved functionality of the network, could potentially drive Ether\u2019s prices higher.","Investors are also likely to view the upgrade as a positive step towards resolving some of the longstanding issues with Ethereum, potentially increasing their confidence and interest in investing in Ether.","This could attract more retail investors and boost DeFi app usage on Ethereum, potentially driving Ether prices beyond $5,000 by year-end, according to Gracy Chen, managing director of Bitget.","ETH last traded around $3,432 as of Friday, and is up 46% in the last month.","The Dencun upgrade, with its Proto-Danksharding feature, aims to greatly improve Ethereum\u2019s user experience by achieving a balance between scalability, decentralization, and network performance.","Andrey Kuznetsov, co-founder of blockchain network HAQQ, said the result is an environment conducive to innovative applications in various fields, from social finance to gaming, facilitating cost-effective transactions for users and allowing developers to create more sustainable solutions without worrying about high transaction costs for end-users.","Bitget\u2019s Chen said that if Dencun is successful, it could boost the ongoing rally in Ethereum\u2019s price by positively impacting market sentiment.","Conversely, if the upgrade fails to deliver as expected, it could lead to disappointment among users, potentially triggering a significant drop in Ethereum\u2019s price and possibly causing a user exodus that might be difficult to reverse in the short term.","The crypto market\u2019s reaction to the Dencun Upgrade\u2019s outcome will likely cause considerable volatility in Ethereum\u2019s value.","\u201CThe Ethereum Dencun Upgrade aligns with the network\u2019s vision to nurture a cheap and scalable network,\u201D Bitget\u2019s Chen said.","This, according to her, will position Ethereum to effectively compete with other blockchain networks like Binance Smart Chain and Avalanche."],"entity":[{"type":"Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"4844","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3,432","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"The Ethereum Dencun Upgrade","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gracy Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Andrey Kuznetsov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$5,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Proto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 13","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Binance Smart Chain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"46%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dencun","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dencun Upgrade","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Dencun","Ethereum","Ethereum Upgrade"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
