However, access to these funds will be restricted to institutional investors and individuals with ultra high net-worth.","Essentially, the decision enables a select group of sophisticated Thailand-based investors to indirectly invest in Bitcoin through regulated channels.","SEC secretary-general Pornanong Budsaratragoon announced that asset management firms are now permitted to oversee private funds that invest in US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday. The SEC board reportedly agreed on this decision last week.","According to SEC regulations, securities companies are authorized to facilitate trading for assets categorized as securities. These ETFs are now classified as securities after Spot Bitcoin ETF trading was approved in the US.","Consequently, Thai securities firms are now permitted to invest in them, aligning with the regulatory framework governing securities trading, the report said.","\u201CAsset management firms asked the SEC for them to have exposure in digital assets, especially Bitcoin and spot Bitcoin ETFs, but we need to consider carefully whether to allow asset management firms to invest in digital assets directly due to the high risk,\u201D Pornanong said.","Existing rules overseeing asset management firms\u2019 investments do not encompass digital asset ETFs. Consequently, the SEC found it necessary to modify these rules to facilitate such investments, according to the official.","The SEC\u2019s approval arrives amidst Bitcoin\u2019s surge to a new all-time high exceeding $72,000. This surge is attributed to various factors, notably the increased investment flowing into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs.","Back in January, Thailand\u2019s SEC said it wouldn\u2019t allow trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country. The regulator wasn\u2019t convinced that foreign-approved Bitcoin ETFs were ready for the local market, feeling like they didn\u2019t match up with what Thailand needed economically.","\u201CWe are monitoring these developments, but currently, there is no plan to permit the establishment of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Thailand,\u201D a representative told the Bangkok Post.","Recently, the SEC has taken steps toward crypto-friendliness by relaxing investment limits for retail investors in specific asset-backed tokens. Additionally, it now mandates custodial wallet management by dedicated entities, reflecting a more open approach to cryptocurrency regulation."],"entity":[{"type":"Thailand","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$72,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Pornanong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bangkok Post","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["spot Bitcoin ETF","Thailand SEC"],"authors":["Shalini Nagarajan"]}
