With clients increasingly seeking exposure to tokenized assets, asset managers who are unable to securely incorporate these assets into their product offerings risk falling behind their competitors.\u201D","Given that this was achieved, asset managers would unlock dormant capital with higher returns by enabling them to tap into previously inaccessible markets or asset classes and access global, liquid, 24\/7 markets.Â ","This would provide greater availability to asset classes that were previously inaccessible or challenging to enter.","With this, asset managers could create novel revenue models with new revenue sources due to the unique opportunities unlocked. They could differentiate their service offerings with novel and bespoke financial products for their clients.","Bridging the gap would unify client portfolios, incorporating both traditional financial assets and digital assets into a single offering.Â ","And finally, it would reduce the back-office operational costs for asset managers since they have to employ fewer intermediaries, exploiting decentralization.Â ","Chainlink argues that blockchain technology is evolving into an \u201Cintegral component of the existing financial ecosystem.\u201D The report highlighted the integration of blockchain and traditional assets into a unified financial ecosystem.","The researchers believe this is the result of ongoing digitization, as blockchains provide better infrastructure for transactions and asset storage.","Although there may be more opportunities to apply tokenization with real-world data, traditional finance should not be overlooked as a target for the technology\u2019s development and adoption.","Chainlink has already become entrenched in the traditional finance market, partnering with companies like ARTA TechFin and ANZ Bank to adapt their services and facilitate the adoption of tokenization.Â ","Real-world data tokenization is not merely a focus, but a contributor to the growing real-world adoption of blockchain technology."],"entity":[{"type":"trillions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"ANZ Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ryan Lovell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 23, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ARTA TechFin","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["ChainLink","Tokenisation"],"authors":["Harvey Hunter"]}
