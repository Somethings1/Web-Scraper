Bankman-Fried was found guilty on multiple charges, including defrauding FTX customers of $8 billion.","The sentencing for SBF in FTX fraud is scheduled for March 28.","The sentencing recommendation, filed on Tuesday, argues for leniency due to Bankman-Fried\u2019s lack of prior criminal history, his young age (31), and his expressed commitment to making amends for the damage caused by FTX\u2019s collapse. SBF also emphasized on his intention to appeal the convictions and the possibility of full compensation for defrauded customers.","SBF\u2019s lawyer wrote to judge Lewis Kaplan presiding over the case:","\u201CWhen the factors are considered, including Sam\u2019s charitable works and demonstrated commitment to others, a sentence that returns Sam promptly to a productive role in society would be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing.\u201D","The 98 page long filing cited several sources and interviews to establish SBF\u2019s personality and his intentions. The filing concluded:","\u201CThe appropriate method of arriving at a just sentence would be to consider the Adjusted Offense Level (Subtotal) of 56, reduced by 30 levels based on zero loss, which yields an advisory Guidelines range of 63-78 months.\u201D","Earlier, the US Probation and Pretrial Services System (PSR) recommended a 100-year sentence in the FTX fraud. Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense team strongly criticized the PSR\u2019s recommendation, calling it \u201Cgrotesque\u201D and \u201Cbarbaric.\u201D They argued that such extreme sentences are reserved for exceptional cases involving violent crimes, which they claim Bankman-Fried\u2019s case does not represent."],"entity":[{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US Probation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lewis Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["FTX","SBF","USA"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
