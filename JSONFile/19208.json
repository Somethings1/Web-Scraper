Applying the research to stablecoins, the bank\u2019s analysts noted that the asset class is prone to \u201Cturbulence and de-pegging events.\u201D","\u201CWhile some may survive, most will likely fail, particularly due to the lack of transparency in stablecoin operations and vulnerability to speculative sentiment.\u201D","The research analyzed the collapse of TerraUSD stablecoin, leaving a ripple effect on the entire crypto market. \u201CThese incidents highlight the volatility and risks associated with stablecoins, and the need for greater transparency and regulation in the cryptocurrency market,\u201D the report read.","Further, Deutsche Bank criticized Tether \u2013 a dominant stablecoin \u2013 questioning its solvency and its industry standard for crypto derivatives.","\u201CA \u2018Tether peso moment\u2019 could cause significant losses, negatively impacting leveraged traders and causing severe repercussions for the entire crypto system.\u201D","Additionally, the report stressed the challenges in constructing stable currency pegs, despite the novelty of cryptocurrencies. \u201CIt is likely that we will see much more instability in the years to come,\u201D it added.","The German banking giant surveyed over 3,350 consumers in March (550 in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, UK each and 600 in USA), questioning the stability of stablecoins.","\u201COnly 18% of consumers expecting them to thrive, while 42% expect them to fade,\u201D the survey found.","","","Notably, the research team wrote that they are concerned about Tether, given its implications amid \u201Cmonopoly in the stablecoin market.\u201D According to a Bloomberg report, the analysts also pointed out reliance on Tether in the crypto derivatives market.","\u201CThe 30% de-peg rate among some stablecoins is therefore hardly surprising, and many defunct stablecoins are hard to account for.\u201D","Retaliating back to Deutsche Bank\u2019s stablecoin claims, Tether said that the research \u201Clacks clarity and substantial evidence, relying on vague assertions rather than rigorous analysis.\u201D","\u201CWhile it attempts to forecast the decline of stablecoins, it fails to provide concrete data to support its claims.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Deutsche Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"France","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tether","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"USA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"42%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1800","content":"DATE"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"18%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"14%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Germany","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Spain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Italy","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Deutsche Bank","Stablecoins","Tether"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
