Skorokhod told the body that \u201Cshe did not have enough technical knowledge\u201D to make purchases and that \u201Call transactions were \u201Ccarried out on her behalf by her [former] husband.\u201D","The MP, per her 2020 declaration, is sitting on a tidy collection of coins, including BTC 44 (USD 2.89m), ETH 130 (USD 620,672) and ETC 135 (USD 7,766).","Ukrainian law requires MPs to declare exactly when they bought tokens and how much they paid for them. But the watchdog says it believes there is a USD 9,347 discrepancy between the tokens\u2019 stated worth at the time of purchase and the prices she (or her ex-husband) allegedly paid for them.Â ","The watchdog further noted that Skorokhod and her former husband Oleksiy Alyakin lived together from December 2015 to April 2021. Skorokhod submitted her declaration for 2020 on March 30, 2021 \u2013 during a time when she was still living with Alyakin.","It added that Skorokhod claimed that she did not know where the keys and any paper documents pertaining to the transactions were now, as, after the couple divorced, Alyakin \u201Cdid not provide access to them,\u201D hinting that \u201Ccriminal proceedings\u201D had been \u201Cinitiated\u201D as a result.","The issue appears to have been complicated after Skorokhod began living with fellow Anton Polyakov \u2013 who died last month in the back of a Kyiv taxi from coronary heart disease, aged just 33. Alcohol and methadone were found in his blood, and some media outlets have alleged foul play.","In June, Skorokhod reported that her passport had been stolen and pressed charges against an unnamed person, but did not report any theft of her crypto holdings.","Skorokhod\u2019s 2020 declaration indicated that Alyakin was also something of a crypto whale. Dependents and immediate family members\u2019 assets must also be detailed on MP declarations.","Her former husband, per the declaration, owned BTC 118 (USD 7.73m), ETH 78 (USD 372,403) and ETC 350 (USD 20,136), although, again, Skorokhod provided no documentation proving the price of the coins when Alyakin bought them.","The watchdog stated that the MP had provided noting but \u201Cgeneral explanations\u201D about the token acquisitions and will push ahead with legal action against the MP \u2013 who faces a fine of up to USD 1,620 if found guilty.","____","Learn more:\n\u2013 Ukrainian MP Cashed in Her Crypto \u2013 and Made More than Twice Her Salary\n\u2013 Ukrainian MPs Want to Jail People Who Don\u2019t Disclose Crypto Holdings\n\n\u2013 Ukraine to Bring Crypto into Legal Sphere after \u2018Legalization\u2019 Bill Passes\n\u2013 Ukraine Might Allow Indirect Crypto Pay, Will Regulate Exchanges\n\n\u2013 \u2018Legalize Crypto,\u2019 Urges Ukrainian Cybercrime Chief\n\u2013 Hurry up and Regulate Crypto, Urges Ukrainian Central Bank"],"entity":[{"type":"Skorokhod","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 30, 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Slovoidilo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alyakin \u201C","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Twice Her Salary\n\u2013 Ukrainian MPs Want to Jail People Who Don\u2019t Disclose Crypto Holdings\n\n\u2013 Ukraine to Bring Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"National Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anna Skorokhod","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December 2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Oleksiy Alyakin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Anton Polyakov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"ETC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Urges Ukrainian Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alyakin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ethereum","Ethereum Classic","Legal","Politics","Ukraine"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
