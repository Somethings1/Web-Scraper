While this reduction in rewards is part of Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic design, it presents miners with a unique set of challenges."],"entity":[{"type":"April 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$502.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$281 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"NASDAQ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.54","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Core Scientific","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.14 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$20.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Adam Sullivan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"fourth quarter of 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$400 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Riot Platforms","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$246.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$434.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$640 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"North America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"4.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$3.40","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$195.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 23","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$137.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$141.9 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Mining","Crypto Mining"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
