The lawmakers also sent a letter to the head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) \u2013 an industry-funded group that sets and enforces securities standards under the SEC\u2019s watch.","The letters raise \u201Cserious questions\u201D about whether the SEC championed Prometheum as a poster firm to represent Gensler\u2019s position that no new laws are needed to regulate and police crypto in the U.S., just as McHenry\u2019s committee was about to send digital assets legislation to the House floor. For its part, Prometheum\u2019s executives have insisted that they\u2019ve been going step-by-step through the registration process like any other firm, and co-CEO Aaron Kaplan has argued that his firm will demonstrate the right way to build a crypto platform that\u2019s compliant with current rules.","\u201CPrometheum purpose-built its technology with the goal to develop a market infrastructure for digital asset securities that is compliant with the federal securities laws,\u201D the company said in a Tuesday statement in response to the lawmakers' campaign. \u201CThis technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.\u201D","The lawmakers are just the latest to call for more information or investigations into the sudden Washington presence of Prometheum \u2013 a company that hasn\u2019t yet done any trading. Other Republican members of the Senate and House have also pursued more scrutiny on the situation, and Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) \u2013 a Democrat on McHenry\u2019s committee \u2013 has requested an investigation of the SEC.","Read More: The Crypto Industry\u2019s New Favorite Punching Bag \u2013 Prometheum \u2013 Asks for a Chance","UPDATE (August 15, 2023, 21:33 UTC): Adds comment from Prometheum.","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"N.Y.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"McHenry\u2019s committee \u2013","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"McHenry\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Industry","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aaron Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ritchie Torres","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Prometheum Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 15, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","SEC","Securities and Exchange Commission","Gary Gensler","House Financial Services Committee","Patrick McHenry","Prometheum"],"authors":["Jesse Hamilton"]}
