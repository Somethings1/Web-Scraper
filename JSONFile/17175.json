The value increased \u201Csignificantly\u201D in the following weeks, with the duo launching collections titled \u201CUndead Apes\u201D and \u201CUndead Lady Apes.\u201D","The following month, the co-conspirators announced their collaboration on X \u201Cwith a well-known and successful NFT project.\u201D","That same day, Roden and Nowlin \u201Cabandoned Undead Tombstone\u201D before ultimately laundering and transferring the funds to cash.","\u201CIn a matter of weeks, the three NFT collections resulted in Rhoden and Nowlin receiving more than $300,000 in cryptocurrency from hundreds of victim-investors all over the world,\u201D the indictment noted.","The scheme, known as a \u201Crug pull\u201D, occurs when a founder or investor hypes up a product only to suddenly abandon it at its peak and disappear with the funds.","Blockchain data firm Chainalysis reported that over $2.8 billion was lost to \u201Crug pull\u201D incidents in 2022 alone.","In this case, Rhoden and Nowlin utilized a technique called \u201Cchain-hopping\u201D to obfuscate customer investments, where funds are transferred between different cryptocurrencies in hopes of evading law enforcement.","According to Elliptic, cross-chain-hopping reached a fever pitch in 2023 when the value of illicit crypto laundered through the technique reached an estimated $7 billion.","On February 26\u2014three days after ICE\u2019s statement\u2014an NFT collection entitled \u201CUndead Apes\u201D was released on launchmynft.io by a user named AZEJGH\u2026R57g.","ðŸš¨PUBLIC FREE MINT IS LIVE ðŸš¨https:\/\/t.co\/hJKhwUHA3W#SolanaNFTs #Freemint #Solana #NFTCommunity","\u2014 Undead Apes â”ƒ FREE MINT (@Apes_undead) February 26, 2024","","At the time of article publication, it\u2019s unclear whether the project is related to Rhoden and Nowlin and if it\u2019s also an NFT rug pull scheme.","If convicted, both Rhoden and Nowlin face a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison."],"entity":[{"type":"February 26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Devin Alan Rhoden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Florida","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 23","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Homeland Security","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nowlin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Roden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Berman Jerry Nowlin Jr.","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alabama","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Rhoden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$300,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Elliptic","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["anti-money laundering","NFT","rug pull"],"authors":["Julia Smith"]}
