SEI Price Drops 11%, Investors Stockpile This New GambleFi Token","category":["Industry Talk "],"content":["Ethereum and Solana competitor Sei\u2019s price has shed 11% in the last week, taking some of the heaviest losses in a brutal market-wide sell-off that sank the price of market leader Bitcoin by about 8% in the same period.","Sei currently changes hands at $0.5385. This represents a slight gain of over 1% in the last 24 hours but a 24% decline from its price this time last month.¬†","Sei is an EVM-integrated blockchain Layer 1, merging Ethereum\u2019s market-leading development framework with the speed and transaction cost scalability of high-performing rivals like Solana.¬†","Investors\u2019 risk-averse sentiment this week appears to be spurred by news that the US Federal Reserve plans to keep interest rates higher for longer to help stem rampant inflation.","Bitcoin retreated 9% in two days, from a high of $64,515 on Tuesday to its current price of $58,595. At the height of the crash, yesterday afternoon, the world\u2019s number one cryptocurrency bottomed out at $56,804.","Virtually all other leading Layer 1 blockchain tokens retained value better than Sei this week. Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH) dropped in tandem, only shedding a little over 3% this week.","Sei\u2019s trading chart over the last three months reveals a token that closely tracked Bitcoin. The market-wide rally that began at the end of February and peaked in early March helped Sei set a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.14 on March 16.¬†However, it has since pulled back about 53%.¬†","The Sei price and valuaiton is currently recovering and is in line with the rest of the market. Its Relative Strength Index is 59 and climbing, indicating increasing buying momentum. It has also appreciated almost 2% in the last hour, so Sei holders are likely out of the woods now.","Scaleability and interoperability are the two hottest buzzwords in crypto right now because they represent the path to greater adoption.","Both Bitcoin and Ethereum lag behind speedier and cheaper rivals, although in terms of interoperability, Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine (EVM) has helped the network\u2019s developer community set smart contract and software standards across the whole industry.","Still, since Layer 1 tokens often rise in sync, investing in them can feel predictable. Crypto and Web3 have a plethora of services to offer beyond more optimized tech.","GambleFi is one sector that\u2019s getting more of a look-in nowadays. The term refers to any crypto-native online gambling platform or product.","According to¬†data by Statista, online gambling is projected to take in $100.90 billion in revenue this year. This means there has never been a better time for crypto to show the world its iGaming utility.¬†","Enter Mega Dice\u2019s brand new $DICE token.","üö® Don't Miss Out!
