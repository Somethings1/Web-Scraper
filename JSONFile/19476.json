The conversion, valued at $39.7 million, allowed the attackers to capitalize on the upward momentum in ETH prices.","Orbit Chain later confirmed an unidentified access to Orbit Bridge, a cross-chain bridging service of the South Korean-based multi-asset blockchain. Following the breach, the project swiftly suspended the cross-chain bridge contract and engaged in on-chain negotiations with the attackers, as reported by Beosin Alert, an on-chain analytics platform.","Concerns about a potential exploit were initially raised by a pseudonymous Twitter user, Kgjr, on December 31. The user highlighted significant outflows from the Orbit Chain Bridge protocol. Subsequent investigations by blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that the hackers orchestrated five separate transactions, transferring various assets to new wallets.","Orbit Chain, renowned for facilitating cross-chain transfers between decentralized networks, particularly EVM-compatible networks and Klaytn, now faces the aftermath of this high-profile breach. The protocol, deeply integrated with the Klaytn network, experienced a substantial loss as eight of the largest assets on Klaytn were wrapped assets on the Orbit Bridge."],"entity":[{"type":"$81.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$ETH","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"South Korean","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$39.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"3.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"December 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"4.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Beosin Alert","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Klaytn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$ETH ($39.7","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kgjr","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2,301","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 2, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Arkham Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.45 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$USDT","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.45","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$WBTC","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$81.6","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Crypto hack","DeFi"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
