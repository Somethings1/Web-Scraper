According to Zeller, the claimed unfair treatment was only \u201Ca poor excuse to justify Gauntlet looking into external business opportunities.\u201D","Zeller also made it clear that the community has begun to recruit other service providers to fill the vacancy.","\u201CAt the ACI, we are considering a very prestigious slot with a current budget of 1.6m\/year just opened, and we\u2019re looking forward to the candidates\u2019 risk teams\u2019 proposals,\u201D said Zeller."],"entity":[{"type":"Gauntlet","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"John Morrow","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gauntlet","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ACI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Morrow","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zeller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CTO Ernesto Boado","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Boado","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Marc Zeller","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Aave","DAO"],"authors":["Hongji Feng"]}
