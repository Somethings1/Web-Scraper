Due to their very nature there is basically zero barrier of entry to somebody cloning a token, & every ERC20 is findable on Uniswap. Always check the contract address to make sure everything looks kosher,\u201D popular crypto trader sicarious warned.","Similarly, another trader opined about DEXs that \u201Cyou miss nothing, they are trading higher, but in reality, the volume is very low, and there is close to 0 liquidity,\u201D while adding \u201Cso if you want to sell your $1,000,000 on the paper and you hit the market you will probably get $50 on the bids until zero.\u201D","The increasing popularity of DEXs was also noted by crypto research firm TokenInsight in its report on crypto spot exchanges for Q2 this year, saying that \u201Cthe volume of decentralized exchanges in this quarter reached USD 191.4bn, which is about the level of the second quarter of the centralized exchanges in 2017.\u201D","Further, the report also showed that Uniswap was the largest DEX over the course of the second quarter this year, even before V2 took off, with the exception of Etherflyer, which may or may not be considered a pure DEX:",""],"entity":[{"type":"$50","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coingecko","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1,000,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Jason Choi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Su Zhu","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kraken","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Uniswap","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kelvin Koh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"second quarter this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Eric Conner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"second quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last 3 years","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Decentralized Exchange","DeFi","DEX","Exchange","Trading","Uniswap"],"authors":["Fredrik Vold"]}
