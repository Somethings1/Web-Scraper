Not everyone is impressed with these plans. ","The exchange will issue rvUSD 47m at a price of USDC 1 per coin, cumulatively raising USD 47m.","Potential buyers will be offered a 20% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) rate in addition to other perks, including 2.5M FLEX coins (USD 2.3m) distributed proportionally across all holders.","Meanwhile, a number of industry observers were quick to argue that there are resemblances between the plan and Ponzi schemes.","\u201CCan anyone remind me, what\u2019s that thing called where you need new investors in order to pay out old investors?\u201D said Joey Politano, an economist and a Financial Management Analyst at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.","\u201CLent money and can\u2019t get the debt back?

Lamb added that if the rvUSD token issuance is fully subscribed, the platform will resume withdrawals starting Thursday, June 30.","Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s native token FLEX has been trending lower recently. It dropped 47% in a single day and 80% in a week, trading at USD 0.917 (at 7:30 UTC).
