The FSC and its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) currently police the sector. The FSC deals with the sector in general, and helps form policy, while the FIU polices crypto exchanges.","The new committee would likely be one of the first dedicated crypto regulatory bodies in the world, and will likely take sole responsibility for controlling the sector \u2013 although the handover of power from the FSC and FIU may be done in a phased manner.","The media report, quoting sources from the People\u2019s Power Party \u2013 the party of President Yoon Suk-yeol \u2013 explained that the body \u201Cis expected to become a control center for policy creation and the supervision of the cryptoasset industry.\u201D","The committee\u2019s work will also center on the creation of the so-called Digital Assets Framework Act. This draft law, which is still in its formative stages, is Yoon\u2019s brainchild, and will likely contain a large set of crypto-specific rules, as well as a number of pro-crypto business measures.","The creation of a regulatory agency of this size will also require no shortage of legislation, which will likely be forthcoming in the months ahead. Instead \u2013 the new committee will likely function on a temporary basis until its existence can be enshrined into law.","An official from the party was quoted as stating that the Digital Assets Committee would be \u201Claunched immediately\u201D once Yoon had appointed a new Chair of the FSC.","The media outlet added that the party had \u201Cdecided to launch the Digital Assets Committee hastily\u201D as a result of the LUNA incident.","The party says that it hopes the body will help \u201Cminimize market confusion and enhance policy effectiveness\u201D by \u201Cunifying the system of the departments currently in charge of sector.\u201D","As well as the FSC and the FIU, other bodies \u2013 such as the finance ministry, the science and ICT ministry, and the Personal Information Protection Committee \u2013 currently govern certain aspects of the crypto industry.","The Digital Assets Commission is expected to create guidelines for the crypto exchange industry, and will reportedly focus on the following areas:","The committee\u2019s launch will also bring some positive news for the sector, however \u2013 with the party suggesting that \u201Cthe schedule for legalizing initial coin offerings (ICOs)\u201D could be accelerated.","Token launches in all their forms have been outlawed in South Korea since 2017. While the golden era of ICOs has been and gone, scores of large companies are keen to launch their own coins \u2013 including the conglomerate SK, which is already advancing quickly with its own token launch plans.","But the government is likely to ask the new committee to focus on potential amendments to the existing Specific Financial Transaction Information Act in the short term. Such amendments would likely focus on \u201Cinvestor protection\u201D-related measures.","An official from the party was quoted as stating:","\u201CCurrently, existing [crypto sector legislation] is limited in terms of regulations, and focuses on business obligations and money laundering-related issues.\u201D","The same unnamed official added that a new FIU director would likely be appointed shortly after the new FSC chief had been put in place.","Critics, including leading academics, have repeatedly called for the government to create a \u201Cministry-level\u201D body capable of governing the sector.","Last week, the nation\u2019s top five exchanges announced they were forming a joint response council in the wake of the LUNA incident \u2013 and the party sources stated that the commission would likely consult with this new body in some capacity.","The exchanges were criticized by politicians and media experts for their lack of a coordinated response to the crash \u2013 with some delisting LUNA and other Terra coins almost immediately, and others only making their delisting announcements late last week.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 South Korean Regulators to Inspect Companies Linked to Terraform\n\u2013 More Crypto Regulation Incoming in South Korea Following Terra Collapse, Gov\u2019t Indicates\n\n\u2013 Brace for More S Korean Altcoins as President-Elect Prepares to Ditch ICO Ban\n\u2013 More Big-hitting South Korean Non-crypto Firms Eyeing Token Launches\n\n\u2013 South Korean Crypto Exchanges Form Joint Response Council to Avoid Repeat of LUNA \u2018Incident\u2019\n\u2013 Upbit Operator Faces Scrutiny Over Affiliate\u2019s 2020 USD 103M LUNA Sale"],"entity":[{"type":"Digital Assets Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FSS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"People\u2019s Power Party","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Services Committee (FSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the Financial Supervisory Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Firms Eyeing Token Launches\n\n\u2013 South Korean Crypto Exchanges Form Joint Response Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yoon Suk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Digital Assets Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ICOs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Newspim","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Personal Information Protection Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FIU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ICT","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["ICO","Regulation","South Korea","Terra"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
