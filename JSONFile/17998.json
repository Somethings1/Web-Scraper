And as demand from investors and users continues to grow, this scarcity drives the price higher.","The first halvening in 2012 saw Bitcoin\u2019s price rise from around $12 to over $260 within a year. ","Similarly, the second halvening in 2016 witnessed a surge from $650 to almost $20,000 by the end of 2017. ","The most recent halvening occurred in May 2020 when the reward per block was reduced from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoins. While the immediate impact on the price was not as dramatic as previous halvenings, Bitcoin started an upward trend shortly after, reaching new all-time highs in 2021.","Bitcoin has also performed well since the start of the year. ","At the beginning of this year, Bitcoin was trading at around $16,000. It has nearly doubled since then, recently hovering around $30,000. ","The cryptocurrency hit a 52-week high last month after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF. ","The filing by the world\u2019s largest asset manager also spurred a surge in ETF applications, with other firms, such as Fidelity, Valkyrie, and Invesco, submitting applications.","Both Bitcoin and Litecoin received a significant boost when EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by Citadel Securities, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab, announced that it would include them among the four tokens available to its customers at launch.","Nevertheless, as the countdown to Bitcoin\u2019s halvening in 2024 begins, industry watchers will be closely monitoring Litecoin as an indicator of what may lie ahead for the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency."," "],"entity":[{"type":"April 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$16,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$12","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2012","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$260 within","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$20,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"22%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"August 1, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Charles Schwab","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"81%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$30,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Valkyrie","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Invesco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Citadel Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$650","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"LTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Litecoin"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
