BTC has since traded back above 66k,\u201D the firm wrote.","The surge in spot prices has coincided with increased institutional demand, with prominent asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld allocating approximately 3% and 2% of their assets under management (AUM) into BTC spot ETFs.","QCP Capital highlights several factors aligning favorably for Bitcoin\u2019s breakout, including growing sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections.","These factors, combined with the recent price movement, have prompted speculation about the resumption of the bull market.","QCP: We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k. The desk saw sizeable buyers of 100-120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot. Institutional demand for the BTC continues to grow with large asset managers Millenium and Schonfeld\u2026","\u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2024","","In light of this optimistic outlook, QCP Capital offers two trade ideas for investors seeking to capitalize on a potential bullish trend.","The first is the June Seagull strategy, which involves selling a 60,000 Put option while simultaneously buying a 70,000 Call option with an 88,000 knock-out level.","This trade can be executed at zero cost, and if the BTC spot price approaches 88,000 at expiry, it could yield a maximum payout of $18,000 per BTC, equivalent to a 249% annualized return.","The second trade idea presented by QCP Capital is the August Seagull strategy, which entails selling a 58,000 Put option and buying a 70,000 Call option with a 100,000 knock-out level.","Similar to the June Seagull, this trade can also be executed at zero cost. If the BTC spot price reaches just under 100,000 at expiry, investors could enjoy a maximum payout of $30,000 per BTC, representing a potential annualized return of 176%.","Despite the bullish view from QCP, Michael Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings, a prominent digital-asset financial services firm, expects Bitcoin to remain in a relatively narrow trading range in the current quarter.","As reported, he expects Bitcoin to remain within the range of approximately $55,000 to $75,000 until specific market events or circumstances push the prices higher.","Novogratz mentioned the tailwinds experienced in the fourth quarter of the previous year and the first quarter of this year.","\u201CI think that is probably where we are certainly for this quarter, maybe next quarter until either A, the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or B, we get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity one way or the other to the crypto regulatory landscape.\u201D","On the other hand, technical analyst Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin has emerged from the post-halving \u201Cdanger zone\u201D and entered an accumulation phase, as indicated by weakening selling pressure.","\u201CThe Post-Halving Bitcoin \u201CDanger Zone\u201D (purple) is officially over,\u201D the popular crypto trader wrote in a recent post on X."],"entity":[{"type":"QCP Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"249%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"176%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Schonfeld","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$55,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June Seagull","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$30,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"this quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Rekt Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$74,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US CPI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 16, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$18,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$75,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the fourth quarter","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","QCP Capital"],"authors":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"]}
