The company is seeking to achieve this through a merger with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV (THCP) by the third quarter (Q3) of 2024.","According to a Coincheck press release, the approval of Thunder Bridge IV\u2019s stockholders is one key condition for the merger to proceed.","","Certain conditions outlined in the definitive agreement between Coincheck and Thunder Bridge IV must also be met.","These requirements are typical for transactions and include the SEC declaring the registration statement effective, receiving specific regulatory approvals, and obtaining approval from the Nasdaq Stock Market to list the securities of the combined company.","Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck is expected to list on Nasdaq under the symbol \"CNCK\" via SPAC in the second or third quarter of 2024, becoming another listed major exchange after Coinbase.

This could increase the visibility of influential crypto companies, driving adoption and investment in the space. One popular company making major moves is MicroStrategy. The publicly traded company is the world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.","Other prominent publicly traded crypto companies include Coinbase and bitcoin mining company Riot Blockchain. Coinbase, for one, has been a standout performer in the stock market. Recently, the US exchange reported aÂ 72% increase in Q1 revenue, smashing estimates.","In another development signifying mainstream crypto adoption, PayPal expanded the inventory of crypto products available to its 426 million customers via its integration with MoonPay. The partnership will make it easier for PayPal customers to buy a wider variety of cryptocurrencies without giving their card details to MoonPay."],"entity":[{"type":"Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"third quarter of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$46 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coincheck","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"72%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"WeWork Inc.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SPAC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq Stock Market","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"third quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 8, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$CNCK","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the Netherlands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coincheck\u2019s Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 8","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MoonPay","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coincheck Group B.V.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coincheck Group N.V.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Coincheck Exchange","crypto adoption","Japan"],"authors":["Jimmy Aki"]}
