But the ban, many big businesses claim, has hamstrung many conglomerates who want to launch cryptoassets as part of their future-focused business expansion plans.","Since the ban was put in place, the likes of Kakao and the Hyundai Group have had to launch coins via overseas affiliates \u2013 in locations such as Switzerland and Singapore. But firms are itching to release coins through domestic channels. And President Yoon Seok-yul, who took power in May, has indicated that he is prepared to finally lift the ban.","Companies, such as the savings provider OK Financial Group and the SK affiliate SK Square, have already announced their own intentions to launch coins \u2013 with many others keen to follow suit.","But the BOK\u2019s latest call could be the final nail in the ban\u2019s coffin. Newsis reported that the BOK today issued a paper on the impact of the EU\u2019s crypto regulation and included a series of recommendations for the South Korean government.","In the paper, the BOK explained that any new crypto-specific legislation should \u201Cinstitutionally permit the issuance of new domestic cryptoassets\u201D \u2013 although it did warn that all ICOs should be subject to regulatory scrutiny.","The bank was quoted as stating that EU measures proved that regulators could apply \u201Cthe same level of regulation\u201D to ICOs as they do to crypto exchanges.","A spokesperson was quoted as explaining that lifting the ban in favor of allowing regulated ICOs could \u201Cenable the development of related industries\u201D while also providing \u201Cprotection for customers and investors.\u201D","The same paper also made note of the need to \u201Cadopt Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA)-level regulations\u201D for stablecoins \u2013 and added that forthcoming crypto legislation would not cover any central bank digital currency (CBDC)-related matters.","____","Learn more: \n\u2013 Brace for More S Korean Altcoins as President-Elect Prepares to Ditch ICO Ban\n\u2013 South Korean Presidential Candidates Pledge Lower Taxes for Crypto Traders, End to ICO Ban\n\n\u2013 \u20187 South Korean Securities Firms Will Launch Crypto Exchanges in 2023\u2019 \u2013 Report\n\u2013 Binance to Help South Korean City of Busan Launch a \u2018Digital Assets Exchange\u2019\n\n\u2013 Two-thirds of Surveyed South Koreans Say Cryptoassets Aren\u2019t Securities\n\u2013 KuCoin & 15 More Crypto Exchanges Face Ire of South Korean Regulator"],"entity":[{"type":"South Korean City","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Surveyed South Koreans Say Cryptoassets Aren\u2019t Securities\n\u2013 KuCoin & 15 More Crypto Exchanges Face Ire of South Korean Regulator","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"OK Financial Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Traders","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"7 South Korean Securities Firms Will Launch Crypto Exchanges","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Busan","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BOK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank of Korea (BOK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yoon Seok","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hyundai Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Central Bank","ICO","Regulation","South Korea"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
