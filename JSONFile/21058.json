In their latest episode, released on December 2, they talked to Dan Matuszewski, Principal and Co-Founder of crypto trading firm CMS Holdings, who previously led one of the largest OTC desks in crypto markets at Circle for over two years and was a part of Kraken\u2019s early team.","On the interviewer\u2019s question about virgin BTC going for a premium as they are \u201Cclean,\u201D Matuszewski quickly replied with \u201Cno.\u201D CMS Holdings has never seen demand for it. \u201CI\u2019ve never seen anybody coming to us trying to buy them,\u201D he says, adding that \u201Cpeople who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about sometimes ask\u201D if a coin is a virgin coin, but it has never happened for somebody to ask to buy specifically and only a virgin coin and say they\u2019re willing to pay more for it.","In either case, Flex Yan, CEO of Babel Finance, a Hong Kong-based crypto financial services company, said in August this year that buyers of \u201Cvirgin bitcoins\u201D are paying up to 20% more for coins with no transaction history. Yan argued that demand for the virgin coins is growing as \u201Cwithout any transactional history, there is essentially no risk of the coins being seized or frozen due to their involvement in questionable past dealings.\u201D Meanwhile, at the same time, Dovey Wan, Partner of crypto investment firm Primitive Ventures, was looking for buyers interested in this kind of BTC.","Back to the podcast, the hosts and the founder further discussed the legend of a virgin coin, saying that there couldn\u2019t possibly be such a thing as fees themselves have history and possibly some taint, and it\u2019d need to be a zero-fee block to have a virgin coin.","In the beginning, CMS Holdings was sourcing Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) directly from the miners, by establishing good relations with them and buying all their flow. It was \u201Ca natural pairing\u201D between \u201Cconsistent sellers [\u2026] consistent buyers,\u201D says Matuszewski.","2017 changed it all, as it changed the miners and their industry. The \u201Cstuff started to get wild\u201D back then and:","At pixel time (13:10 UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 7,330 and is almost unchanged in the past 24 hours. It\u2019s up by 2.4% in the past week, trimming its monthly losses to 20%. The price is up by 81% in a year."],"entity":[{"type":"81%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Castle Island Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Primitive Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Babel Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Matuszewski","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dovey Wan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CMS Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Flex Yan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Matt Walsh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August this year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dan Matuszewski","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nic Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Mining","Trading"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
