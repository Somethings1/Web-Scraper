The analyst noted:","\u201CThe diminishing selling pressure from GBTC and consistent inflows into other ETFs, averaging $300-400 million daily according to recent data, have been significant contributors.\u201D","However, Kooner cautions against solely relying on historical patterns. \u201CWhile they offer insights, they don\u2019t guarantee repetition,\u201D he emphasizes. He points to the rising interest in altcoins as a unique aspect of this potential pre-halving phase.","Commenting on the entire crypto market reaching $2 trillion in value, the analyst said:","\u201CThere has been a gradual flow of capital towards the altcoin market. Due to the large number of crypto projects this cycle, however, there has been a flow of capital into specific sectors like the Solana ecosystem and AI based projects rather than a gradual spreading of capital into all altcoin markets.\u201D","The next Bitcoin halving is expected in April, reducing the miner reward per block by 50%. This event, occurring roughly every four years, aims to control the supply of new Bitcoins, potentially impacting its value due to increased scarcity."],"entity":[{"type":"$2 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$300","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"13%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$52,290","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kooner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jag Kooner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$52,000","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin halving","Bitcoin Price"],"authors":["Jai Pratap"]}
