Staking offers a way for crypto holders to contribute to the security and functionality of a blockchain while earning passive income through the rewards associated with the staking process.","While the Bitcoin blockchain depends on the proof-of-work mechanism, where miners solve intricate mathematical puzzles to generate new Bitcoin, proof-of-stake networks such as Ethereum operate differently by allowing token owners to pledge their assets to run the network.","To evaluate protocols for potential inclusion in the Fund, Grayscale will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria, including factors such as staking rewards, market capitalization, and liquidity.","The GDIF is currently available for investment by qualified clients, defined by the SEC as an individual with a net worth of at least $2.2 million, excluding the value of their primary residence, or possessing assets under management amounting to $1,100,000.\n","Since its conversion to an ETF in mid-January, Grayscale has witnessed a reduction of nearly 33% in its Bitcoin holdings within its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).","Before the conversion, Grayscale\u2019s fund held approximately 620,000 BTC, according to Coinglass.
