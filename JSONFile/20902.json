The jurisdiction issues crypto asset service providers (CASPs) license under the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services (FAIS) Act.","\u201CThe public is reminded that the FSCA\u2019s licensing powers are limited to the authorization and supervision of CASPs only insofar as they render financial services related to crypto assets as defined under the FAIS Act.\u201D","These services include advice, intermediary and investment management services, the notice read. FSCA added that it does not include recognition of crypto assets as legal tender.","\u201CAny media reports implying otherwise are therefore incorrect as the South African Reserve Bank does not currently recognize crypto assets as currency,\u201D the watchdog stressed.","Some of the entities that received crypto licenses include Luno, Altcoin Trader, VALR, among others.","The country received over 374 applications from CASPs, and after two years of laying the groundwork, has licensed only 75. \u201CThe FSCA will continue to provide regular updates as these applications are processed and approved,\u201D the release added.","Binance, one of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges, however, did not make crypto license holders\u2019 list in South Africa.","The exchange established its local presence in the country in July 2022. However, the exchange announced previously that it is terminating some services in South Africa to comply with regulations. The halting of services followed warning from the regulator about consumers\u2019 risks in engaging with the \u201CBinance Group\u201D.","According to the FSCA, Binance is not authorized to offer any financial services or businesses in South Africa, and SA does not regulate crypto-related investments currently. Additionally, the South African Revenue Service (\u200B\u200BSARS) has imposed new taxes on cryptocurrencies by up to 45%."],"entity":[{"type":"South Africa\u2019s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance Group\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South African Revenue Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South African Reserve Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"45%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Financial Advisory","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FSCA","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Binance","Licence","South Africa"],"authors":["Sujha Sundararajan"]}
