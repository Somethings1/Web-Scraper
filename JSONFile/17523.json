Dogecoin Knockoffs Dominate DEX Trading","category":["Altcoin News "],"content":["As if one dogecoin (DOGE) was not enough, now they are multiplying \u2013 with a gamut of hound-themed clones, knockoffs and imitators attempting to ride on the vapor trail of the breakaway, meme-themed, Elon Musk-championed coin.","Worse still, these tokens are currently trending like there\u2019s no tomorrow on the decentralized Uniswap exchange. Per data from Dextools, the top 10 list of tokens on the platform is dominated by DOGE clones. These are mostly trading for fractions of a dollar \u2013 but some investors are making purchases and sales of millions of tokens at a time.","Proving that there\u2019s no such thing as copyrighting an idea, this army of stray doggos appears to have captured the imagination of some corners of the crypto community.","The mastermind behind one of the breakaway clones \u2013 calling itself snoop doge (SNOGE) \u2013 took to Reddit to claim the coin was \u201Ca reflectionary token inspired by HOGE, WOGE, and all the other strains of OGE\u201D \u2013 whatever that means.","The SNOGE issuer added that with \u201Cheavy investments in the cannabis industry,\u201D its \u201Cteam aims to leverage the decentralized, uncensored nature of Ethereum in order to bridge the expertise of the cannabis industry with retail investors and connoisseurs that want to capitalize on society\u2019s undervaluation of cannabis products and companies.\u201D","Quite.","And then there\u2019s WOGE, which, \u201Cis an ERC-20 token that turns grams to quarters and ounces to packs,\u201D wrote its issuers. They also say they will be raising funds for \u201Cunjustly incarcerated\u201D individuals doing jail time for marijuana-related offenses.","\u201COne of the worst feelings was missing out on HOGE,\u201D the WOGE issuer wrote. \u201CThe second worst feeling was missing out on SOGE. I think you know where I\u2019m going with this\u2026 Don\u2019t let this be the time you passed out on the next colossal coin.\u201D","The author doubtlessly meant \u201Cpassed on,\u201D but somehow \u201Cpassed out on\u201D seems more appropriate.","These two are just the tip of the iceberg, however: The mutts just keep on coming. And with greyhound-like alacrity, their number is being led by a coin named shiba inu (SHIB), which per CoinGecko data has experienced 30-day growth of an astounding 4,138%.","However, this athletic mutt may already have been hobbled: In the past 24 hours, SHIB has lost some 40% of its value, while DOGE is down by 20%.","On its blog page home, named All Hail the Shiba (how Cryptonews.com wishes it was making all this up), the project called itself the DOGE \u201Ckiller.\u201D Its chief architect claimed that the SHIB \u201CTelegram community has 6,000+ members\u201D although \u201Csome are bots someone added, but it\u2019s ok\u201D and \u201Cmillions of dollars in trading volume on Uniswap.\u201D","And there\u2019s more. A veritable puppy platoon.","Almost USD 89m of another clone, kishu inu (KISHU), has been traded in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data.","There\u2019s also huskytoken, which calls itself DOGE\u2019s \u201Clittle brother,\u201D adding: \u201CIt is same as shiba inu but with different tokenmetrics.\u201D The issuer claimed that \u201C50% of the supply was sent to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s wallet,\u201D and that this was \u201Cequal to burn\u201D (sic).","And there\u2019s Wooftalik Dogerin (WOOFT), currently selling like hotcakes on Uniswap, per Etherscan data. And akita inu (AKITA), down in value by over 52% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing, but still at number two in the Uniswap charts.","Beneath these, the whole animal kingdom beckons. Cryptonews.com has also seen lesser-performing cat- and frog-themed DOGE clones, but will spare you the details.","On Twitter, commentators mused about what the market capitalization of these tokens might be, while others worried that the farcical nature of these tokens could drag crypto\u2019s name into the mud.","One wrote,","\u201CThese, including DOGE, is why regulators want to clamp down on cryptocurrency. Indirectly hurting those who\u2019ve been building relentlessly in the space for years for actual use cases.\u201D","Others reported that \u201Cnocoiners\u201D had caught doggy fever, and that they wanted to spread the word to anyone who would listen.","\u201CNo possible way this could turn out badly,\u201D remarked one Reddit user.","Meanwhile, back in DOGE town (the actual dogecoin, this time), the PR gurus at the raisin producer Sun-Maid decided to clamber aboard the banter bandwagon with a little Twitter-based humor.","___\nLearn more:\n\u2013 Dogecoin\u2019s Surge a Result of a Elon Musk-DogeDay-Crypto Popularity Mix\n\u2013 DOGE Flips XRP, Ethereum, and Bitcoin On Google, Surpasses Tether\n\u2013 Dogecoin At The Top 10 Gate as Cuban, Musk Stoke Social Media Flames\n\u2013 DOGE\u2019s Rally Has Revived Dogecoin Development, But For How Long?\n\u2013 Novogratz Brands Dogecoin a \u2018Joke,\u2019 Tells Mark Cuban to Steer Clear\n\u2013 Crypto ATM Provider CoinFlip Adds Dogecoin, \u2018Validating Its Legitimacy\u2019\n\u2013 Are GameStop-Style Surges In Crypto Any Different From Old Pumps & Dumps?"],"entity":[{"type":"Novogratz Brands Dogecoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto ATM Provider CoinFlip Adds Dogecoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"\u201Cmillions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Crypto Any Different From Old Pumps & Dumps","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"4,138%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"past 24 hours","content":"DATE"},{"type":"HOGE","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Dextools","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"52%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"GameStop","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Altcoins","Decentralized Exchange","Dogecoin","Scam","Trading","Uniswap"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
