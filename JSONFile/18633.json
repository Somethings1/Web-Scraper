Or at least she would be, if police could find her.","A Chinese woman known under the name \u201CYadi Zhang\u201D is wanted both in China and Britain for her role in laundering money stolen from investment fraud schemes perpetrated between 2014 and 2017.","Chinese authorities allege Zhang stole $6.3 billion at the time.","Like Crater, Zhang was able to commit multiple counts of fraud in open sight because there was very little scrutiny of what was going on in crypto before Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 bull run.","When she got to London, Zhang employed an assistant, Wen, to help her launder the money. Wen alleges that she was under the impression Zhang had given her that the latter ran a prestigious jewellery and antiques business.","Wen is currently on trial in the UK on money laundering charges.","In 2017 and 2018, the pair converted the Bitcoin loot into fiat, jewellery and property.","When Wen tried to buy a $12.5 million home with gym and cinema in Zhang\u2019s name through law firm Mishcon de Reya, the purchase failed because the law firm could not verify the source of the bitcoin. In October 2018, the Met police froze Zhang\u2019s Mishcon account.","That same year, the M raided the duo\u2019s Hampstead mansion and seized over 61,000 Bitcoin, valued $1.7 billion at the time ($2.5 billion today), from a safe deposit box containing four hardware wallets.","The police successfully recovered the cryptocurrency from the devices in 2021 and announced it last month."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Atlantic","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hampstead","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zhang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Russell Crater","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Pamela Clegg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mishcon de Reya","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$7.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Britain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$12.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USPS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$6.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Yadi Zhang\u201D","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Fraud","my big coin","russell crater"],"authors":["Tim Hakki"]}
