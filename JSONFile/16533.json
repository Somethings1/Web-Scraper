Eclipse last raised cash at a nine-figure valuation in September 2022.","The fresh funding round gives Eclipse Labs capital to fill top slots in growth, HR and research as it prepares to open its novel mainnet to developers. One developer building an app that will run on Eclipse told CoinDesk that launch is weeks away.","Eclipse seeks to use a mix of technology from Solana, Celestia, Ethereum and RISC Zero for its proposed scaling solution \u2013 basically, speed like Solana with security provided by Ethereum. Apps built for Solana will be able to run on Eclipse with minimal changes, with SOL being the token of the realm.","The result will be a \u201Cnet additive for both ecosystems,\u201D Somani said. \u201CFrom an ETH perspective, this is an important way for Ethereum to scale. For Solana, we\u2019re bringing more people into the Solana Virtual Machine,\u201D or SVM.","The SVM \u2013 Solana\u2019s execution environment \u2013 is the software that allows Solana-based DeFi protocols to run. Blockchains in Ethereum\u2019s orbit commonly use EVM to make it easy for Ethereum-based protocols such as Uniswap to port themselves over to their thing. So, too, will be the case for Eclipse. Somani said \u201Cmajor Solana protocols,\u201D including the lending platform Solend, have agreed to set up operations on Eclipse when it launches.","\u201CIt\u2019s a good bet, in my opinion,\u201D said Rooter, the pseudonymous developer behind Solend.","Somani said the mainnet launch will only target developers. That means Eclipse won\u2019t initially set up a user-friendly bridge through which traders and other would-be users could easily move money into the ecosystem.","Of course, such details haven\u2019t dissuaded eager users before. Last July, Coinbase\u2019s Base blockchain attracted millions of dollars of inflows before its public debut. Traders seemed too keen to speculate on the Ethereum layer 2\u2019s meme coins to wait.","Somani said Eclipse is committed to decentralizing its governance over time and putting stakeholders in charge of big decisions. When asked if this meant Eclipse would airdrop a token, he declined to say. However, he acknowledged that tokens have become an accepted part of decentralizing governance in crypto projects.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"SVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Neel Somani","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Rooter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Eclipse","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SOL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana Virtual Machine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Celestia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Coinbase\u2019s Base","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Somani","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$50 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Solana","layer 2","Funding"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
