Last Thursday, while announcing the sentence, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Bankman-Fried never offered \u201Ca word of remorse\u201D for his \u201Cterrible crimes.\u201D","\u201CIt\u2019s most of what I think about each day,\u201D Bankman-Fried told ABC News. \u201CI never thought that what I was doing was illegal. But I tried to hold myself to a high standard, and I certainly didn\u2019t meet that standard. I\u2019ve heard and seen the despair, frustration and sense of betrayal from thousands of customers; they deserve to be paid in full at the current price.\u201D","The former FTX boss said the insolvency of FTX was the result of several \u201Cbad decisions\u201D he made in 2022. Bankman-Fried also noted that the customers \u201Ccould and should\u201D have been paid in 2022, and it\u2019s \u201Cexcruciating to see them waiting, day after day.\u201D","\u201CI\u2019m haunted, every day, by what was lost. I never intended to hurt anyone or take anyone\u2019s money. But I was the CEO of FTX, I was responsible for what happened to the company, and when you\u2019re responsible, it doesn\u2019t matter why it goes bad. I\u2019d give anything to be able to help repair even part of the damage. I\u2019m doing what I can from prison, but it\u2019s deeply frustrating not to be able to do more,\u201D he said to ABC News.","On Thursday, Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense team said it would be appealing. During the interview with ABC News, Bankman-Fried said certain trial testimony \u201Cgreatly misstated what actually happened,\u201D and his defense was \u201Cnot allowed to introduce crucial evidence or put on important witnesses.\u201D","Read all of CoinDesk\u2019s coverage on the Sam Bankman-Fried trial here.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ABC News","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Metropolitan Detention Center","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brooklyn","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fried","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lewis Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Sam Bankman-Fried","SBF Trial","FTX Collapse","top news","Crypto"],"authors":["Amitoj Singh"]}
