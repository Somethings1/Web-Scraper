This civil case accuses Kwon and Terraform Labs of perpetrating a $40 billion crypto fraud, primarily related to misleading investors about the stability of Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin UST.","The trial is now scheduled to begin on March 25th.","","The extradition news sparked immediate volatility within the market. Luna, the native token of the Terra blockchain, experienced a sharp 12% decline before recovering slightly. Market analysts attribute this price fluctuation to investor uncertainty surrounding Kwon\u2019s legal proceedings and the potential impact on Terra\u2019s future.","While some investors may perceive the extradition as a step towards accountability, others fear that extended legal battles could further destabilize the Terra ecosystem. Luna currently trades at $0.6645, and its price trajectory stays highly dependent on the outcome of Do Kwon\u2019s trial."],"entity":[{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 25th","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$40 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$0.6645","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Podgorica Airport","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 21, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Montenegro\u2019s High Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Do Kwon","Terra"],"authors":["Joel Frank"]}
