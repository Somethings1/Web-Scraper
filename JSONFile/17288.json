A total of 457 ETH (~$1.34 million) was initially drained, but 366 ETH (~$1.07 million) was rescued by c0ffeebabe.eth and returned to the multisig wallet, the team noted.","\u201CDeposited funds are currently safe,\u201D Blueberry said. \u201COnly three markets were affected and the large majority was already returned. Total validator payment (loss) is 91 ETH. We are getting in touch and aim for a full repayment to users as the goal. Protocol is paused.\u201D","The Blueberry Protocol is a decentralized lending market that facilitates lending and leveraged borrowing with the ability to go up to 20 times the value of the collateral.","According to DefiLlama, the protocol had a total value locked (TVL) of $4.5 million before the incident. Its TVL has now fallen to $3.11 million after the exploit attempt.","On February 22, Blueberry released a \u201Csecurity overview,\u201D saying that its approach to development and risk mitigation prioritizes security from the outset to prevent any internal risks arising from protocol activity.","The protocol also said that it underwent audits by Hacken and Sherlock who conducted two independent token security audits.
