It also suggests that different types of architectural and technological design options are available to build a technical solution for a digital euro,\u201D the Frankfurt-based bank said in a statement. ","Between July 2022 and February 2023, the ECB carried out a prototyping exercise on what paying with a digital euro could be like for various use cases. ","The exercise comprised the integration of five user interfaces developed by a number of providers for each use case (front-end prototypes), as well as a settlement system the Eurosystem designed and developed (back-end prototype). ","Different design choices were put to test to determine if it could be possible to technically implement and integrate them into the Eurosystem\u2019s settlement scheme, according to the statement. ","\u201CThe tests concluded that it is possible to smoothly integrate a digital euro into the existing payment landscape, while still leaving scope for the market to use innovative features and technologies when distributing a digital euro. The findings also confirm that a digital euro could, in principle, work online and offline using different technical designs,\u201D the ECB said. ","Meanwhile, there remains the question of whether an offline solution that complies with the Eurosystem\u2019s requirements and delivers the necessary scale can be delivered in the short to medium term with the existing tech, the bank concluded. ","The EU launched its digital euro project in October 2021. The ECB\u2019s Governing Council is scheduled to decide in autumn 2023 whether it intends to proceed with a preparation phase to develop and test the EU\u2019s designed central bank digital currency (CBDC). ","\u201CIf the Governing Council opts to go ahead with a preparation phase, this does not necessarily mean that it will issue a digital euro. The Governing Council will take a dedicated decision on whether to issue a digital euro at a later stage,\u201D according to the bank. "],"entity":[{"type":"Frankfurt","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Governing Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"autumn 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ECB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ECB\u2019s Governing Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Central Bank (ECB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"euro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"European Union","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 2021","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bank","CBDC","ECB","EU"],"authors":["Jaroslaw Adamowski"]}
