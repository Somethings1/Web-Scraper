Governor Elvira Nabiullina has repeatedly demanded that crypto should not officially \u201Center the Russian economy.\u201D","Russian crypto expert experts said lawmakers were effectively \u201Ctalking about a ban on transactions involving Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.\u201D Aksakov, meanwhile, said:","\u201CThere is a need for a ban as, currently, cryptocurrencies have become a type of quasi-currency that is replacing the ruble in this country. But only the Russian ruble can be considered a legal monetary unit. And that is why we made this decision.\u201D","Several British men have been charged under a new national security law for supporting Russia by carrying out an arson attack on a Ukraine-linked business https:\/\/t.co\/jtlyuovTSP","\u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) April 26, 2024","","Aksakov stopped short of announcing that the bill would force Russian banks to refuse crypto exchange-related transactions.","However, it appears that such a clause could well be included in the final bill. This would present a major issue for the millions of Russian crypto users living in the country.","The Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy Anton Gorelkin struck a slightly more optimistic note in a post on his Telegram channel.","Gorelkin claimed that the bill would not \u201Cprohibit\u201D the \u201Ccirculation of cryptocurrencies in Russia.\u201D","Instead, the lawmaker claimed that only \u201Cthe organization of circulation will be prohibited\u201D under the new bill.","He said that the law would instead seek to crack down on illegal crypto exchanges operating outside the Central Bank\u2019s new \u201Cexperimental legal regime (EPR).\u201D","The lawmaker claimed that \u201Cproviding business with unhindered access\u201D to the crypto sector would leave them vulnerable to \u201CWestern sanctions.\u201D","Gorelkin noted that the ban could be subject to future \u201Crevisions,\u201D and wrote:","\u201CIt\u2019s a paradox, but the [proposed] ban on organizing the circulation of [cryptoassets] is quite a protectionist measure.\u201D","It appears likely that the EPR will supervise the sale of industrial crypto miners\u2019 coins to overseas buyers.","Rosfinmonitoring, the top Russian anti-money laundering regulator, has previously said it was \u201Cmonitoring\u201D over 25,000 domestic crypto users.","And Rosfinmonitoring also called on the government to rush the rollout of crypto regulation after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) downgraded Russia\u2019s compliance rating due to \u201Cinsufficient regulation of virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Bloomberg Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EPR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Central Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elvira Nabiullina","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"State Duma","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 26, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FATF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State Duma Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NSN","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the Financial Action Task Force","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anatoly Aksakov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"State Duma Committee on Information Policy Anton Gorelkin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulation","Russia"],"authors":["Tim Alper"]}
