On the other hand, spokespeople for both coins insist they\u2019re not securities at all.","In an interview with The New York Times, Gensler said, \u201CThere is a strong case for both of them \u2014 but particularly Ripple \u2014 that they are noncompliant securities.\u201D However, he believes Bitcoin \u2014 and some others cryptocurrencies, like Litecoin and Monero \u2014 can remain exempt from securities regulations due to the way it is decentralized, but this is not so clear in the case of Ether and Ripple.","\u201C2018 is going to be a very interesting time,\u201D Mr. Gensler said. \u201COver 1,000 previously issued initial coin offerings (ICOs), and over 100 exchanges that offer ICOs, are going to need to sort out how to come into compliance with US securities law.\u201D The recent crackdowns of The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on non-compliant ICOs show that this process has already begun.","While most blockchain experiments are in an early stage, Gensler said he had become convinced that blockchains could replace many of the middlemen in the financial industry. Due to his experience, his words carry a lot of weight in the broader financial community, and he does believe in crypto, having said that, \u201CI would be surprised if 10 years from now [cryptocurrency] isn\u2019t somewhere in the financial system in a meaningful way.\u201D","Gensler, has recently begun working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to write and teach about the potential he sees in blockchain."],"entity":[{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"The New York Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goldman Sachs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Litecoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hillary Clinton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Obama","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Ether","Regulation","Ripple"],"authors":["Sead Fadilpašić"]}
