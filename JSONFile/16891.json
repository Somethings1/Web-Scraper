That\u2019s nearly double the average cost of $6,851 now. Essentially, miners will have to run twice the number of computations, with a corresponding increase in electricity usage, to get the same amount of bitcoin they\u2019re getting now. ","","","The estimated cost is also well above the current market price of about $10,300, providing an illustration of how the halving could turn the crypto-mining industry\u2019s profitability upside-down if market prices don't rise. ","","","The halving was programmed into bitcoin\u2019s original network programming as a a bulwark against inflation when the cryptocurrency was created just over a decade ago. The idea was a predictable and ever-slowing pace of new supply of the cryptocurrency would help to stabilize bitcoin's purchasing power \u2014 a contrast with government-backed currencies that can often be printed at will by human central bankers. ","","","What's happening now is a lesson on the emerging economics of bitcoin\u2019s commodity-like market cycles: Crypto mining companies are scrambling to get ready for the halving by upgrading their fleets of computers to include next-generation processor chips that are faster and more energy-efficient. ","","","Researchers at the U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase have described bitcoin miners\u2019 average cost as the cryptocurrency\u2019s \u201Cintrinsic value.\u201D Think of it like oil drillers\u2019 cost to pump an incremental barrel: If a drop in the market price renders oil unprofitable, many drillers will shut off the tap until prices rise again.  ","","","TradeBlock\u2019s estimated post-halving cost of $12,525 assumes the network\u2019s current processing power, known as the \u201Chash rate,\u201D stays at its current level. The analysis also assumes an electricity price of 6 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, which is higher than the roughly 2 cents that some big crypto-mining firms say they can get from the local grid or through wholesale purchasing agreements. ","","","Another quibble-prone assumption is that roughly 30 percent of mining computers will \u201Ctransition\u201D to the latest technology, while 70 percent \u201Cremain on older devices,\u201D according to TradeBlock. Some crypto-industry executives say it's more likely many of the older-generation mining computers or \"rigs\" will become uneconomical after the halving, leaving faster machines to dominate the network.","","","Whatever the case, the threshold bears monitoring closely for bitcoin investors, says John Todaro, TradeBlock's director of digital currency research.","","","\"It's very helpful to know what the miners are thinking, what the miners are doing,\" Todaro said in a phone interview. \"There might be some miners that are profitable at those levels, but not a lot of miners are going to be operating at a loss, and they might take their rigs offline.\"",""],"entity":[{"type":"$90,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$12,525","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$6,851","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2 cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"70 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"TradeBlock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"30 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"John Todaro","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$10,300","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"6 U.S. cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Todaro","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Miners","Electricity","Bitcoin Miners","Bitcoin Halving","Halving 2020","Halving Costs"],"authors":["Bradley Keoun"]}
