Miller, in which a CEO of a domestic financial institution was sentenced to probation for failing to implement an effective AML program or file suspicious activity reports (SARs).","Zhao\u2019s lawyers have recommended that their client be sentenced to probation, not jail \u2013 a sentence which would closely mirror that of BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who pleaded guilty to the same crime in 2022 and was sentenced to six months of house arrest and two years of probation.","\u201CThis is a high-profile case, to be sure. But Mr. Zhao is not a symbol,\u201D Zhao\u2019s lawyers argued. \u201CHe is a devoted father, a philanthropist\u2026 He has already shown remorse for his offense and, more importantly, has remediated.\u201D","The 161 letters filed with the court served to back up Zhao\u2019s lawyers claims, but also provide an unprecedented glimpse into the private life and personal history of the notoriously private Binance founder.","Zhao, now worth over $40 billion according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index, was once a first-generation immigrant to Canada who was the poorest in his high school friend group and worked part-time at McDonald\u2019s \u201Cto support his family and to have spare allowance to spend,\" Ted Lin, a high school friend and later colleague at Binance, said in his letter.","His friends from high school recall Zhao as a top student and formidable athlete, who became captain of the school volleyball team after teaching himself how to play the sport by reading library books on the subject, Lin\u2019s letter said","Letters to the court also revealed Zhao to be the father of five children \u2013 two adult children from his marriage to Weiqing \u201CWinnie\u201D Yang, who are both currently enrolled at U.S. universities, and three young children with Binance co-founder and current partner Yi He.","According to both Zhao\u2019s current and former partners, he is a devoted father.","In her letter to the court, Zhao\u2019s wife Yang said that, even when Binance was going through massive growth, he took the time to spend time with his adolescent children, flying to see them in Tokyo when they had issues in school and going camping in the Japanese countryside with his middle school-aged son during Boy Scout trips.","Yang also celebrated her estranged husband\u2019s philanthropy \u2013 including donations to earthquake victims in Turkey and building schools in Africa, saying \u201Che has done so many things that he may not even remember them.\u201D","He, his current partner, said her children are \u201Cvery close\u201D to Zhao, and have suffered from his absence over the past five and a half months.","\u201CNow they are always asking: Why isn\u2019t Dad home? When can Dad come back?,\u201D He wrote.","He also told the court about Zhao\u2019s disinterest in luxury goods \u2013 something that was also mentioned by many of the Binance co-founder\u2019s other family members, friends and colleagues.","\u201CHe knows nothing about the jewelry, luxury goods, luxury cars, and art auctions that rich people are passionate about,\u201D He wrote, adding that Zhao purchases his clothes on Amazon, rides a scooter to meetings and drives a Toyota minivan.","Another friend of Zhao\u2019s recollected visiting him at home in 2021, when crypto trading volumes were hitting all-time highs, and being surprised to find him \u201Cliving under his means\u201D in a three-bedroom apartment in Singapore strewn with children's toys and operating Binance from his dining room table.","The description of Zhao\u2019s purported \u201Capathy toward hedonism,\u201D as another friend described it, mirrors similar claims by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s family and friends ahead of his sentencing.","In their own letters to the judge, Bankman-Fried\u2019s family attempted to paint the disgraced former FTX CEO as completely uninterested in wealth or luxury or the company of celebrities that were paid to endorse his company. The judge was apparently unconvinced, and sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison for his crimes.","Whether or not the judge in Zhao\u2019s case will feel differently will be determined tomorrow, though Zhao's case has other differences. Bankman-Fried did not accept responsibility or show remorse, according to the judge overseeing his case, while Zhao pleaded guilty last year.","The charges are also different; Zhao's exchange never filed for bankruptcy and is continuing to operate today, while Bankman-Fried's notably saw customers worldwide lose access to around $8 billion in funds.","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ted Lin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Turkey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Amazon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"McDonald","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Toyota","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Miller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tokyo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$40 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Yang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BSA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arthur Hayes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Department of Justice (DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Winnie\u201D Yang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"past five and a half months","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"last November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$8 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Binance","Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao","U.S. Department of Justice"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
