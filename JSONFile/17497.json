Kennedy Jr. is committed to transforming the US budget system by adopting blockchain technology. He revealed his plans during a campaign rally in Michigan on April 21, where he explained that the shift would enable Americans to access \u201Cevery budget item anytime they want, 24 hours a day.\u201D","During his campaign, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. emphasized the importance of providing citizens unlimited access to government budgets.

It provides a secure and tamper-proof transaction record, averting financial misappropriation and allowing the public to verify government use of funds and ensure accountability.","Increased accountability promotes integrity in public governance and reduces corruption. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 2.5% of the world\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), estimated to be $1.4 to $2.6 trillion, is lost through corruption.","This proposed move by Kennedy has sparked online debates among US residents and crypto investors.","As is expected, many in the crypto community have praised the idea as innovative and a secure means to combat corruption.","THIS ALONE is a reason I will vote for RFKjr.","It will break my heart if Tulsi is chosen as VP with Trump, but putting the entire US budget on blockchain would be transformative.","I don\u2019t believe in silver bullets, but this is a close as one gets to one.","Ok\u2026 I am all in\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/Te7pEUXuxL","\u2014 Alan Myron : E Pluribus Unum ðŸŒº (@AlanMyron) April 22, 2024","","Some critics have raised concerns, however, suggesting that Kennedy\u2019s blockchain plan implies support for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which contradicts his previous decision to stop US efforts to introduce a CBDC if elected, as he noted its infringement on privacy.","In January 2024, Kennedy argued that a CBDC would allow the government to monitor every citizen\u2019s transaction, potentially leading to blackmail, which he deemed a \u201Ccalamity for human rights and civil rights.\u201D","Dr. Joseph @Mercola and I discuss financial freedom in the 21st century.
