Racing rewards are paid out in SPONGE V2.","But perhaps the most exciting thing about Sponge is that it\u2019s still super early to get into the coin.","Meme coins like Bonk, Dogwifhat, and Pepe have shown how an upstart meme coin can reach a multi-billion-dollar market cap.","The meme coin\u2019s website is also teasing that it will soon launch on bigger and better exchanges, which could bring a wave of new buyers to $SPONGE.","At under $150 million, Sponge could be looking at 10 or even 100x upside from here.","Buy Sponge Here",""],"entity":[{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Floki Inu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.0032","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$0.0003","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bonk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$SPONGE","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"400%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$2.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"650%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"February 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$129 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dogecoin\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Floki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$150 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Floki Inu","Meme coin","Sponge"],"authors":["Joel Frank"]}
